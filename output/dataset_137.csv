 Hoo Sheau Peng JC:
Introduction
1       The first defendant, Mr Goh Chan Peng (“Mr Goh”), was a former director and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of the plaintiffs (“the Plaintiffs”). The Plaintiffs allege that Mr Goh had breached various duties owed to them and further engaged in a conspiracy with the third defendant, Wyser International Limited (“Wyser International”), and a competitor to injure the Plaintiffs. Mr Goh’s wrongdoing purportedly resulted in the diversion of certain business with a customer to the competitor and culminated in the loss of the entire business with the customer. For the role Mr Goh played, he allegedly received two payments from the competitor via Wyser International, which dishonestly assisted in Mr Goh’s breach of duties. The First Plaintiff’s claims relate to the loss of the customer’s business (in part and in whole) and the two payments made. Separately, the Second Plaintiff claims against Mr Goh for unjustified expenses and salary.
2       In response, the defendants (“the Defendants”) deny that Mr Goh was in breach of duties and maintain that he acted in the best interests of the Plaintiffs at all times. While Mr Goh does not deny that he received payments from the competitor, he claims that they were for consultancy services provided to the competitor. Further, there was no conspiracy between Mr Goh, Wyser International and others to injure the Plaintiffs. Wyser International did not dishonestly assist in the breach of his duties. The loss of the customer’s business, in whole or in part, was not caused by them. Finally, the expenses and salary were justified.
3       The trial dealt with both liability and quantum. It was heard over 19 days in August and September 2015, with written submissions filed in November and December 2015. I now deliver my judgment.
Background Facts
Parties, entities and persons
4       To begin, I set out the background facts of this case. The first plaintiff, Beyonics Technology Ltd (“the First Plaintiff”), is a company incorporated in Singapore on 9 November 1994. It was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange on 30 August 1995. In February 2012, Channelview Investments Ltd (“Channelview”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, completed its acquisition of the First Plaintiff and became its sole shareholder. The First Plaintiff was delisted on 15 February 2012.
5       The First Plaintiff has wholly owned subsidiaries in many countries. The second plaintiff, Beyonics International Pte Ltd (“the Second Plaintiff”), is one such subsidiary. Collectively, the First Plaintiff and its subsidiaries shall be referred to as the “Beyonics Group”. The Beyonics Group is engaged in a variety of businesses. In particular, its precision engineering division (“PE Division”) manufactures (
inter alia
) baseplates, which are key components of hard disk drives (“HDDs”). The PE Division comprises the following subsidiaries:
(a)     Beyonics Precision Engineering Pte Ltd, which is incorporated in Singapore;
(b)     Beyonics Precision Machining Sdn Bhd (“BPM”), which is incorporated in Malaysia, and runs a plant in Tampoi, Johor Bahru, Malaysia;
(c)     Wealth Preview Sdn Bhd (“Wealth Preview”), which is incorporated in Malaysia;
(d)     Beyonics Technology (Thailand) Co Ltd (“BTT”), which is incorporated in and ran a plant in Thailand;
(e)     Beyonics Technology Electronic (Changshu) Co Ltd (“BTEC”) which is incorporated in China and runs a plant in Changshu, Suzhou, China; and
(f)     Beyonics Asia Pacific Limited (“BAP”), which is incorporated in Mauritius.
6       While there are four defendants in this suit, substantively, the action is against Mr Goh and Wyser International. From 1 May 2000, Mr Goh was the director and CEO of the Plaintiffs, as well as the CEO of the Beyonics Group. He resigned on 9 January 2013. Wyser International and the fourth defendant, Wyser Capital Limited (“Wyser Capital”), are companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The companies are beneficially owned and controlled by Mr Goh. There is no substantive case against Wyser Capital. Nor is there any substantive claim against the second defendant, Mdm Lee Bee Lan (“Mdm Lee”), who is Mr Goh’s wife. They were sued mainly for the purpose of a Mareva injunction application filed earlier by the Plaintiffs. I shall make no further mention of Mdm Lee and Wyser Capital in the judgment.
7       It is also necessary to introduce the “competitor” of the Beyonics Group mentioned in [1]. Nedec Co Ltd (“NEDEC”) and Kodec Co Ltd (“KODEC”) are both companies incorporated in South Korea. Together with other associated companies, they shall be referred to as the “NEDEC/KODEC Group”. The NEDEC/KODEC Group is also involved in the precision engineering business, including the manufacturing of baseplates for HDDs. In particular, one of its entities, Langfang NEDEC Machinery & Electronics Co Ltd (“LND”), has a baseplate manufacturing facility located in Hebei, China. Mr Tae Sung Lee (“Mr Tony Lee”) is the chief financial officer (“CFO”) and managing director of the NEDEC/KODEC Group, while Mr Hwang Sejoon (“Mr Stephen Hwang”) is the CEO of the same.
8       The “customer” of the Beyonics Group described in [1] is Seagate Technology International (“Seagate”), one of the largest manufacturers of HDDs, and a key customer that purchased baseplates from the PE Division of the Beyonics Group. Mr Billy Chua is the Senior Manager of the Asia Commodity Management Team at Seagate. He was the main point of contact with the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group at the relevant time.
Key events
Manufacturing of baseplates for Seagate
9       I now set out the key events relevant to the present suit. From about 1987, Seagate began purchasing baseplates from the Beyonics Group. When Channelview was in the process of acquiring the First Plaintiff in early October 2011, Seagate remained an important customer of the First Plaintiff.
10     At this juncture, I briefly explain the process of manufacturing baseplates for Seagate. Broadly speaking, this can be divided into two main stages: the “First Stage Work” and the “Second Stage Work”. The First Stage Work involves processes such as die-casting, and ends with e-coating so as to produce “e-coated baseplates”. The Second Stage Work involves, among other things, precision machining and other works on the e-coated baseplates leading to the production of the “finished baseplates” supplied to Seagate.
11     Seagate baseplates are produced under various programmes, each having its own specifications. To be able to supply baseplates to Seagate for a particular programme, a supplier must undergo a qualification process. Over the years, the Beyonics Group has achieved qualification to perform both the First and Second Stage Work for numerous Seagate baseplate programmes, and supplied finished baseplates to Seagate. A programme known as “Brinks 2H” is the programme at the centre of the case.
Floods in Thailand and the aftermath
12     In October 2011, a major disruption to the global HDD business occurred. Severe floods in Thailand caused serious destruction to the facilities of many HDD manufacturers and component suppliers. BTT’s factory, the Beyonics Group’s baseplate manufacturing facility in Thailand (see [5(d)]), was not spared and had to be shut down.
13     After the disaster, Seagate was anxious to secure capacity from the HDD component suppliers to supply baseplates for its HDDs. It reached out to its suppliers to assist. What transpired among Seagate, the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group in the aftermath of the Thailand floods is heavily disputed, especially in relation to Mr Goh’s role from October 2011 to 24 November 2011. I shall return to these disputes in due course.
The B–N Alliance
14     On 24 November 2011, at a meeting between Mr Billy Chua, Mr Tony Lee and Mr Goh, Seagate approved of a new collaboration between the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group. This collaboration shall be referred to as the “B–N Alliance”.
15     On 10 January 2012, the B–N Alliance was encapsulated in an agreement between BAP, a subsidiary of the Beyonics Group (see [5(f)]), and LND, a subsidiary of the NEDEC/KODEC Group (see [7]) (“the BAP–LND Contract”). In relation to the manufacture of Seagate baseplates for the Brinks 2H programme, it was agreed that BTEC, the Beyonics Group’s plant in Changshu, China (see [5(e)]), would complete the First Stage Work to produce e-coated baseplates for supply to LND. LND would then perform the Second Stage Work, produce the finished baseplates and sell them to Seagate. From January 2012 to January 2013, the Beyonics Group duly supplied e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
The Wyser Agreements
16     From 24 November 2011, there were negotiations concerning agreements to be entered into between the NEDEC/KODEC Group and Wyser International connected to the B–N Alliance. On 5 April 2012, two agreements were signed by Mr Goh, on behalf of Wyser International, and Mr Tony Lee of the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Both were backdated to 24 November 2011 (“the Wyser Agreements”). The first of these agreements (“the First Wyser Agreement”), entered into with KODEC, provided for a payment of US$0.02 per e-coated baseplate as follows:
1. Wyser assists in securing 6 million baseplates capacity business starting from April 2012 for the Seagate Brink 2H program for an approximately US$ 45.6 million sales per year supplying at least 1 million pieces of e-coated baseplates to Kodec ;
…
1) a monthly sales and management support service fee of US$0.02/pc X monthly Brink 2H shipping quantity under co-ordination of Wyser to Kodec (accepted quantity to LND based) starting from February 2012 till March 2013 ;
Payment details: Wire Transfer to the follows:
…
Name of beneficiary: Wyser International Limited
17     The second agreement (“the Second Wyser Agreement”), signed with NEDEC, provided as follows:
2. Wyser assists in securing a US$ 2.5 million as the co-sharing grant of fixture and tooling cost funded by Seagate.
1) US$500,000 payable in 2012 immediately upon receipt of payment from Seagate.
Payment details: Wire Transfer to the follows:
…
Name of beneficiary: Wyser International Limited
18     By a third agreement, US$300,000 of the US$500,000 payable to Wyser International under the Second Wyser Agreement was to be transferred to Mr Stephen Hwang. The third agreement was apparently not signed.
Termination as supplier to Seagate
19     The Beyonics Group’s sales to Seagate steadily declined from about Financial Year (“FY”) 2012. In FY 2014, being the accounting period beginning 1 August 2013 and ending 31 July 2014, Seagate had terminated the Beyonics Group as its supplier of baseplates for Seagate HDDs. Thus, the Beyonics Group lost the entirety of its baseplate business for both the First and Second Stage Works with Seagate.
Summary of the cases
The Plaintiffs’ case
20     I now set out the Plaintiffs’ case as pleaded in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) (“the Amended Statement of Claim”).
21     The First Plaintiff relies on several causes of action. First, according to the First Plaintiff, Mr Goh, as director and CEO, owed contractual, statutory and fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs. In breach of these duties, Mr Goh committed acts which fell within four somewhat overlapping areas:
(a)      
Securing the B–N Alliance.
 Mr Goh entered into the BAP–LND Contract, which concretised the B–N Alliance, effecting a diversion of business (Second Stage Work for Brinks 2H baseplates) away from the Beyonics Group.
(b)      
Procuring a US$2.5 million grant from Seagate (“the Seagate Grant”).
 Mr Goh procured the Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group, thus assisting to boost its technical capabilities, and facilitating its growth as a supplier of baseplates for Seagate HDDs.
(c)      
Receiving payments under the Wyser Agreements.
 For his role in diverting e-coated baseplates, payment was made under the First Wyser Agreement based on US$0.02 per e-coated baseplate diverted from the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. For his role in procuring the Seagate Grant under the Second Wyser Agreement, Mr Goh received a net gratification of US$200,000.
(d)      
Facilitating the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate.
 Mr Goh further facilitated the NEDEC/KODEC Group to undertake business with Seagate in competition with the Beyonics Group, and the ultimate intention was for the NEDEC/KODEC Group to supplant the Beyonics Group in the supply of baseplates to Seagate. This included assisting the NEDEC/KODEC Group to develop e-coating capabilities to carry out First Stage Work, and aggressively pushing for the sale of BTEC to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, which would further strengthen the latter.
22     Second, the First Plaintiff claims that Wyser International dishonestly assisted Mr Goh’s breaches of fiduciary duties and/or knowingly received the payments under the Wyser Agreements.
23     Third, the First Plaintiff contends that Mr Goh, Wyser International and the NEDEC/KODEC Group conspired by unlawful means to injure the First Plaintiff and its subsidiaries, with the ultimate intention of hollowing out the baseplate production capacity of the Beyonics Group in favour of the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
24     The First Plaintiff’s various wholly owned subsidiaries within the PE Division supplied the baseplates to Seagate, and the revenue from all these contracts were recognised in the accounts of BAP. As the holding company, the First Plaintiff claims against Mr Goh and Wyser International, 
inter alia
, equitable compensation for its losses of profits as follows:
(a)     Loss of profit as a result of the diversion of the Second Stage Work to the NEDEC/KODEC Group from January 2012 to January 2013 (“Diversion Loss”).
(b)     Loss of profit as a result of the loss of future baseplate business from Seagate (“Total Loss”).
25     In relation to the payments under the Wyser Agreements, the First Plaintiff also claims against Mr Goh and Wyser International, among other things, for an account of the amounts received and payment of the amounts.
26     Separately, the Second Plaintiff alleges that in breach of his duties, Mr Goh caused or instructed staff members to make unjustified expense claims amounting to S$126,967.45 and HK$38,400.00 against the account of the Second Plaintiff, and claims for a payment of these amounts. Further, the Second Plaintiff claims that it is entitled to recover unjustified salary of S$45,900 paid to Mr Goh from 10 January to 31 March 2013, after Mr Goh’s resignation on 9 January 2013, because Mr Goh did not disclose his breaches of duties.
The Defendants’ case
27     In the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) (“the Amended Defence”), the Defendants deny the breaches of contractual, statutory and fiduciary duties by Mr Goh, dishonest assistance and/or knowing receipt by Wyser International, and that Mr Goh and Wyser International had conspired by unlawful means with the NEDEC/KODEC Group to injure the Plaintiffs.
28     In relation to the four areas of alleged misconduct relied on by the First Plaintiff, the Defendants’ broad positions are as follows:
(a)      
Securing the B–N Alliance.
 Seagate was the one who proposed that the Beyonics Group partner the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Further, there was already a commercial relationship between Seagate and the NEDEC/KODEC Group from around April 2011.
(b)      
Procuring the Seagate Grant.
 Mr Tony Lee secured the Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group, not Mr Goh.
(c)      
Receiving payments under the Wyser Agreements.
 Prior to agreeing to the B–N Alliance, Mr Goh visited the LND factory and found that the NEDEC/KODEC Group needed to make improvements to meet Seagate’s requirements for the Brinks 2H programme. Mr Tony Lee asked Mr Goh to provide consultancy services to the NEDEC/KODEC Group for such improvements. He agreed to do so and was duly paid under the Wyser Agreements. The payments were not bribes but payments for consultancy services provided.
(d)      
Facilitating the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate.
 The NEDEC/KODEC Group was capable of undertaking both the First and Second Stage Works for the manufacturing of baseplates, and Mr Goh did not assist to develop such capabilities. Mr Goh also did not insist on taking charge of the proposed sale of BTEC. Instead, the sale was always subject to the review and approval of the Board of Directors. Therefore, he did not facilitate the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate.
29     In relation to the claims by the Second Plaintiff, Mr Goh contends that the expenses claimed were incurred in the best interests of the operations and staff of the Second Plaintiff. Mr Goh, as the CEO, had the authority to incur the expenses claimed. The Second Plaintiff is also not entitled to recover the salary justifiably paid to Mr Goh. Instead, Mr Goh counterclaims S$17,000 from the Second Plaintiff for salary still unpaid to him for April 2013.
30     Further or in the alternative, Mr Goh states that he acted honestly and reasonably at all times. Specifically, it is pleaded that under s 391 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), Mr Goh ought to be excused from liability for negligence, default or breach of duty, if any.
The trial
31     At the trial, the main witnesses for the Plaintiffs were Mr Kyle Arnold Shaw Jr (“Mr Shaw”) and Mr Gerhard Hans-Joachim Christoph Mueller (“Mr Mueller”) (who were both appointed as directors of the First Plaintiff after its acquisition by Channelview), Mr Michael Ng (who replaced Mr Goh as the CEO of the First Plaintiff), and Mr Lee Leong Hua (who is the general manager of BTEC). Mr Goh and Mr Tony Lee were the key witnesses for the Defendants, while Mr Billy Chua was subpoenaed as a witness for the Defendants. There were also two expert witnesses, one each for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, who dealt with the quantification of the losses allegedly suffered by the Plaintiffs. I shall deal with the relevant portions of the witnesses’ evidence when discussing the specific issues in contention.
32     I should highlight at the outset that the Plaintiffs had to recover email communications between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group through digital forensics. These emails had been deleted from the desktop computer and the laptop Mr Goh used in his term with the Beyonics Group (“the recovered emails”). In the interlocutory stages of the action, Mr Goh admitted to deleting the emails, but claimed that he had done so because it was the company policy to free up memory space. At the trial, he denied that he had deleted the emails. Instead, he suggested that the deletion might have been the result of reformatting carried out as a matter of standard procedure after he resigned. However, the Plaintiffs’ position is that the reformatting of Mr Goh’s devices had not been carried out so as to enable forensic recovery of evidence. Mr Goh has not challenged this.
33     I shall set out my views on Mr Goh’s credibility at [180] onwards, along with my observations of the other witnesses. For now, it suffices to comment that the recovered emails, together with other emails, form a contemporaneous record of the developing relationship between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group, the discussions between them, and the nature of certain transactions. The emails provide the invaluable context to understand the unfolding events, and I rely on them extensively to arrive at my findings.
Preliminary issue – an unpleaded defence
34     I turn to deal with a preliminary issue. In the Defendants’ closing submissions, counsel for the Defendants, Mr Ng Lip Chih, argues that in view of the Plaintiffs’ express admission in the Amended Statement of Claim that the revenue from the baseplate contracts with Seagate was recognised in the accounts of BAP (see [24]), BAP, rather than the First Plaintiff, should be the proper party to claim for any damages and/or losses of profit arising from the alleged breaches by Mr Goh. It would be erroneous at law to equate a loss of profits incurred by BAP to a loss of profits by the First Plaintiff. At best, the First Plaintiff would have a claim for loss of dividends flowing from BAP to the First Plaintiff. However, there was no quantification of such a loss. Therefore, Mr Ng Lip Chih submits that the First Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendants must fail. In the Plaintiffs’ reply submissions, counsel for the Plaintiffs, Ms Marina Chin, makes two points. First, she contends that the defence has never been pleaded, and should be disregarded. Second, she argues that the defence is in any case unmeritorious. I shall deal with these points in turn.
35     It is uncontroversial that pursuant to O 18 r 8(1)(
a
) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), a party, in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim, is required to specifically plead any matter which “he alleges makes any claim … of the opposite party not maintainable”. A defence that BAP, and not the First Plaintiff, is the proper party should be specifically pleaded, as it is clearly intended to render the First Plaintiff’s claim unsustainable. Alternatively, the defence should have been pleaded because it is a matter “which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise” (see O 18 r 8(1)(
b
) of the ROC). It is trite that if pleadings are not sufficiently specific, the courts may not allow the party to pursue a certain line of argument (see 
Tan Kia Poh v Hong Leong Finance Ltd
 
[1993] 3 SLR(R) 429
 at [30] and [33]).
36     Apart from the matter not being pleaded, I note that it is not even contained in any of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) filed by the Defendants’ witnesses. Mr Ng Lip Chih alluded to this argument only on the first day of the trial, during the cross-examination of Mr Shaw. This drew an immediate objection by Ms Marina Chin on the ground that the defence has not been pleaded. Mr Ng Lip Chih acknowledged this, and did not touch on this point again for the rest of the trial. In addition, no step was taken to seek leave of court to further amend the Amended Defence so as to include this defence. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the Defendants should not be allowed to rely on this argument at all.
37     In any event, I agree with Ms Marina Chin that the defence is substantively flawed. The First Plaintiff’s claims have always been for its own losses as the holding company of all the subsidiaries in the PE Division. It did not seek to equate the losses of BAP with its own losses, as the Defendants claim. As will be seen at [192] onwards, in computing the alleged losses, the First Plaintiff relied on financial information on a consolidated basis, and did so from the perspective of the First Plaintiff (and not its subsidiaries). There is nothing to show that the First Plaintiff is not in the position to direct and control the application of the cash and profits of its subsidiaries, including BAP. Therefore, I find that the First Plaintiff is able to pursue the claims. I should add that had this matter been pleaded, the First Plaintiff could have simply taken steps to add BAP to the action, if at all necessary.
The First Plaintiff’s claims for breaches of duties 
38     With that, I move on to the substantive claims by the First Plaintiff, beginning with Mr Goh’s purported breaches of duties. Given that the First Plaintiff pleads breaches of contractual, statutory and fiduciary duties, analytically, there are three distinct causes of action grounded in contract, tort and equity respectively. Broadly speaking, the elements to be proved are the existence of the duties, the breaches of these duties, and the breaches causing the losses allegedly suffered.
39     On the existence of the duties, as pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim, the contractual, statutory and fiduciary duties owed to the First Plaintiff largely overlap. To prove the breaches of these three categories of duties, the First Plaintiff cites the same alleged misconduct. However, to establish causation, the First Plaintiff relies principally on the equitable principles applicable to breaches of fiduciary duties. The remedies elected are also primarily equitable ones. From the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions, it seems clear to me that the First Plaintiff’s case rests mainly on the equitable basis. Therefore, for the purpose of this judgment, my primary focus is on the breaches of fiduciary duties. If these are established, there will be no practical need to consider the alleged breaches of contractual and statutory duties.
Duties owed by Mr Goh
40     The company–director relationship is a well-established category of fiduciary relationship. It is not seriously disputed (nor do I think it can be seriously disputed) that Mr Goh, as a director and the CEO of the Plaintiffs, owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs. In my view, Mr Goh owed these four overlapping duties which are pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim:
(a)     Duty to act honestly and 
bona fide
 in the best interest of the First Plaintiff. In this regard, it has been stated that “[d]irectors … may only consider the interests of their company when making a decision. Their overriding motive must be to advance the company’s interests”: see 
Walter Woon on Company Law
 (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 3
rd
 Ed, 2009) (“
Walter Woon on Company Law
”) at para 8.16.
(b)     Duty to avoid and disclose conflicts of interest. Flowing from the duty to act honestly and in the best interests of the company, a director should not “place himself in a position where his duty and his interest conflict”, such that there is a risk that he prefers his personal interest over that of the First Plaintiff: see 
Walter Woon on Company Law
, at para 8.37 and 8.43.
(c)     Duty not to make any secret or improper profit. This is a particular instance of the rule against conflicts of interest. As stated in 
Walter Woon on Company Law
 at para 8.45, this rule “is so strict that if an opportunity to make a profit or obtain a benefit comes to him because he is a director, that profit or benefit must be disclosed to the company and approved. In the absence of such disclosure and approval, the director is liable to account for that profit even if he has been guilty of no moral wrong.”
(d)     Duty to disclose wrongdoing. Encompassed within the duty to act 
bona fide
 in the best interests of the company is a duty on the fiduciary to disclose his wrongdoing to the company. In 
Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing
 
[2013] 3 SLR 631
 (“
Quality Assurance
”) at [97], the High Court cited 
Item Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi
 [2004] EWCA Civ 1244 at [41]–[44] for the proposition that “[a]n employee who is also a fiduciary and who owes his employer a general fiduciary duty of loyalty – that is, a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of his employer – is obliged pursuant to that general duty to disclose his own wrongdoing to his employer”.
41     For completeness, I should add that ss 156, 157(1) and 157(2) of the Companies Act impose statutory duties on directors, largely similar in scope and extent to the abovementioned fiduciary duties. In particular, as observed by the Court of Appeal in 
Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Ptd Ltd
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 597
 at [59], s 157(1) of the Companies Act (which 
inter alia
 imposes a duty on a director to act honestly in the discharge of duties of his office) is the “statutory 
equivalent
 of the duty to act 
bona fide
 which exists at common law” [emphasis in original]. I also find that the employment contracts impose similar express or implied duties on Mr Goh. Nonetheless, as I stated at [39], it is unnecessary to go into these matters in any depth.
Whether the alleged acts were committed
42     I proceed to consider whether Mr Goh committed the alleged acts falling into four clusters of events as summarised at [21]. Mr Goh denies the First Plaintiff’s version of the events and attempts to explain how and why, when viewed in context, his actions were in the best interests of the Beyonics Group. I shall discuss the factual disputes before dealing with Mr Goh’s explanations.
Securing the B–N Alliance
43     The details of the B–N Alliance are set out at [14]. According to the First Plaintiff, after the Thailand floods, Mr Goh either conceived of or facilitated the formation of the B-N Alliance, thus diverting the Second Stage Work to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. However, Mr Goh stated that Seagate had requested the Beyonics Group to partner the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
44     I observe that Mr Billy Chua was consistent in maintaining (during both examination-in-chief and cross-examination) that it was Seagate which proposed the B–N Alliance. Thus, I accept that Seagate initiated the collaboration. Be that as it may, I find that Mr Goh was instrumental in the process leading to the approval of the B–N Alliance by Seagate, and entry into the BAP–LND Contract. This is borne out by a close examination of the events prior to, and culminating in, a meeting on 24 November 2011.
Growing relationship between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group – June to September 2011
45     According to the First Plaintiff, in late June 2011, Mr Goh initiated contact with the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Thereafter, he pursued the relationship for his personal benefit. Mr Goh explained that at that juncture, he was in contact with the NEDEC/KODEC Group solely for the sale of BTEC, pursuant to the Beyonics Group’s policy to divest the PE Division (see further discussions from [92] below).
46     From the emails produced before me, I note that in late June 2011, Mr Goh requested a business contact to introduce him to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. He was introduced to Mr Stephen Hwang, who indicated that he wanted to discuss with Mr Goh about business with Seagate. On 12 July 2011, Mr Stephen Hwang visited BTEC in China. From 4 to 7 September 2011, Mr Stephen Hwang and Mr Tony Lee visited BTT and BPM in Thailand and Malaysia.
47     After these visits, the parties exchanged a series of emails, which form part of the recovered emails with subject matter headings “Thank you for your favour” and “Appreciation for Hospitality”. On 8 September 2011, Mr Stephen Hwang wrote to thank Mr Goh for “well meant advice [which would] be a great help how Nedec survives in HDD business”. On the same date, Mr Tony Lee sent an email expressing his appreciation for the “warm hospitality”, and stated that he had been informed that Mr Tay Peng Huat, the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Beyonics Group, was “going to dispatch the data and information” that Mr Stephen Hwang and Mr Tony Lee had requested. On 30 September 2011, Mr Stephen Hwang extended an invitation to Mr Goh to visit LND, which Mr Goh accepted. Mr Tony Lee sent a reply on 4 October 2011, and expressed appreciation for Mr Goh’s “intention to visit NEDEC factories around Nov. 10”, and saw this as an opportunity for the parties to engage in “further talks for co-operation and collaboration.”
48     From the above, it is clear that Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group were open to pursuing business opportunities together. Even if there was the plan to divest BTEC and the PE Division, it does not seem to have been necessary for Mr Goh, as the CEO of the Beyonics Group, to offer a competitor of the Beyonics Group access to information on the PE Division and arrange factory visits at such an early stage, or to give advice on surviving in the HDD business. There was also no reason for Mr Goh to accept a visit to LND. In my assessment, even in the early days, there was already some indication that Mr Goh pursued the relationship partly in his personal capacity, rather than solely for the Beyonics Group.
Seagate’s preference after the Thailand floods – October 2011
49     After the floods in Thailand in October 2011, the First Plaintiff claims that Seagate would have preferred to work with its existing suppliers (including the Beyonics Group) to increase production, rather than with a new supplier, as it would take some time for a new supplier such as the NEDEC/KODEC Group to become qualified as a Seagate baseplate supplier. Mr Goh refuted this by stating that the NEDEC/KODEC Group was an existing supplier of Seagate, not a new supplier.
50     In my view, Mr Goh’s position is misleading. It was not disputed that Seagate acquired Samsung’s HDD business sometime in 2011, and that by virtue of the acquisition, the NEDEC/KODEC Group had become pre-qualified to supply baseplates to Seagate for 
Samsung
 HDDs. However, the NEDEC/KODEC Group did not automatically qualify to supply baseplates for 
Seagate
 HDDs. Indeed, in October 2011, the NEDEC/KODEC Group was not a supplier of baseplates for Seagate HDDs. Further, Mr Billy Chua’s evidence is that Seagate would have preferred to depend on existing suppliers. He explained that Seagate had stringent standards. It was not simple, quick or certain for a new supplier to obtain qualification for Seagate HDDs.
Level of commitment and support indicated by Mr Goh – mid-October 2011
51     Against this backdrop, around mid-October 2011, Mr Goh received a telephone call from Mr Billy Chua. According to Mr Goh, it was a brief conversation in which Mr Billy Chua merely asked what the Beyonics Group could do to help and requested for a proposal to support Seagate. Mr Billy Chua gave a different account of the conversation. He said that there was a discussion about the Beyonics Group’s production capacity, with Mr Goh informing him that the Beyonics Group was only able to continue with the supply of three million Brinks 2H baseplates per quarter. Seagate, however, wanted a commitment of more than four million per quarter. On this point, I prefer the evidence of Mr Billy Chua. In my view, Mr Goh under-represented the Beyonics Group’s capacity to produce baseplates at the time, and showed little commitment and willingness to support Seagate. I deal with the production capacity issue from [97] onwards.
Discussions on the B–N Alliance – 24 to 26 October 2011 
52     Sometime on 24 October 2011, Mr Billy Chua contacted Mr Tony Lee for the first time via email to ask whether the NEDEC/KODEC Group wished to participate in Seagate’s baseplate production programme. Later the same day, the parties spoke on the telephone. This conversation was recorded in an email at 5.20pm on the same day from Mr Billy Chua to Mr Tony Lee, indicating that the parties had discussed, 
inter alia
, the Pharaoh 2H (another name for Brinks 2H) baseplate programme. I note that Mr Billy Chua’s initial contact with the NEDEC/KODEC Group came 
after
 Mr Goh showed a lack of commitment to Seagate, as described immediately above.
53     While not stated in the email at 5.20pm, it appears that during the telephone conversation between Mr Billy Chua and Mr Tony Lee, the idea of a potential partnership between the NEDEC/KODEC Group and another baseplate supplier was also discussed. On 25 October 2011, Mr Tony Lee wrote an email to Mr Billy Chua stating that the NEDEC/KODEC Group would prefer to obtain e-coated baseplates for a “machining process service” (
ie
 Second Stage Work), and asked whether it should obtain these for machining from the Beyonics Group, or another supplier, MMI. He also asked to meet Mr Billy Chua. Replying on the same day, Mr Billy Chua confirmed a meeting in Singapore on 27 October 2011 from 9am to 4pm to discuss matters.
54     On 26 October 2011, Mr Tony Lee sent an email to Mr Goh informing him of the full day meeting with Seagate confirmed for 27 October 2011. He stated that issues to be discussed might include a “‘[j]oint operation’ of your Changsu (
sic
) factory” (
ie
 BTEC). He asked to meet Mr Goh on 28 October 2011. When cross-examined, Mr Goh said that he did not know what Mr Tony Lee wanted to discuss with him, and he had no clue what the “joint operation” meant. Mr Goh insisted that he only found out about the B–N Alliance from Mr Billy Chua over the telephone on 27 October 2011. However, Mr Tony Lee testified that “joint operation” referred to the proposal for the Beyonics Group to supply e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
55     From Mr Tony Lee’s email of 26 October 2011 and his evidence, the clear inference I arrive at is that Mr Goh had already spoken to Mr Tony Lee about the proposed B–N Alliance 
ie
 the “joint operation” 
before
 the email on 26 October 2011. In fact, in Mr Goh’s reply to the 26 October 2011 email, he simply agreed to a meeting on 28 October 2011, without asking any question as to what the “joint operation” meant, rendering his version quite incredible. I should add that the 26 October 2011 email between Mr Tony Lee and Mr Goh formed part of the recovered emails, and carried the subject matter heading “BTEC”.
Meeting between Seagate and the NEDEC/KODEC Group – 27 October 2011 
56     At 8.50 am on 27 October 2011, a mere ten minutes before Seagate was to meet Mr Tony Lee of the NEDEC/KODEC Group for the first time, Mr Goh sent a critical e-mail to Mr Billy Chua claiming that “due to having major losses in PE division; 
our investment is limited and we could only exercise limited investment strategy
 to help the current demand faced by our customers” [emphasis added]. This was purportedly Mr Goh’s response to Mr Billy Chua’s request for a proposal from the Beyonics Group to support Seagate. In cross-examination, Mr Goh accepted that when he sent this email, that he was aware that the 27 October 2011 meeting was due to commence, and that the NEDEC/KODEC Group was keen to do business with Seagate.
57     After the meeting on 27 October 2011, Mr Billy Chua sent an email to Mr Tony Lee including the minutes of the meeting. The minutes reflected that Seagate had agreed to a plan for a partnership between the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group to produce baseplates, specifically for the NEDEC/KODEC Group to use the Beyonics Group’s e-coated baseplates for the Brinks 2H programme (essentially the terms of the B–N Alliance). The email also stated that Mr Billy Chua had earlier spoken to Mr Goh, who had “no objection[s]”. Mr Goh, however, insisted that the first time he heard about the proposed B–N Alliance was over the telephone from Mr Billy Chua after his email at 8.50am and after the meeting on 27 October 2011. When confronted with Mr Billy Chua’s email recording the minutes of the meeting, he said he did not know “how [Mr Billy Chua] records his minute[s]”.
58     As stated at [55], I find that well before 27 October 2011, Mr Goh knew about Seagate’s proposal from Mr Tony Lee. It seems to me that Mr Goh’s email at 8.50 am, and his indication of support of the partnership, were aimed at prompting Seagate to proceed to give approval for the B–N Alliance.
Meeting between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group – 28 October 2011
59     On 28 October 2011, Mr Goh met Mr Tony Lee and agreed that the Beyonics Group would participate in the proposed B–N Alliance, even though the parties had not even discussed fundamental terms such as pricing.
Mr Goh’s visit to LND – 10 November 2011 
60     On 10 November 2011, Mr Goh visited LND. According to Mr Tony Lee, the B–N Alliance was discussed during this meeting. Mr Goh also suggested making improvements for the NEDEC/KODEC Group to achieve qualification to do the Second Stage Work for Seagate. While travelling from Tianjin to Beijing in a three-hour car ride with Mr Tony Lee and Mr Stephen Hwang (“the car journey”), Mr Tony Lee said he proposed that Mr Goh be compensated for his consultancy services. Mr Goh did not say anything.
61     Mr Goh, however, disagrees with Mr Tony Lee’s account of what transpired. In cross-examination, Mr Goh insisted that his visit to LND was regarding the sale of BTEC, and did not involve discussions regarding the B–N Alliance. He claimed that the Beyonics Group, as the vendor of BTEC, was obliged to visit LND, a potential purchaser of BTEC, to “understand the capability and integration between their plant [and] our plant after the completion of the process”, and to make sure the NEDEC/KODEC Group was getting a good deal.
62     It is plain that Mr Goh’s evidence that the visit was for the sale of BTEC is unbelievable. There is no commercial reason for a vendor to assist a potential buyer by ensuring that he was getting a good and suitable deal. Instead, it appears that Mr Goh was evasive and simply refused to reveal details of the visit. In fact, Mr Goh shifted his evidence on the purpose of the LND visit in the course of proceedings. In the Amended Defence, it is pleaded that the visit was “for the purposes of evaluating whether the NEDEC/KODEC Group was able to meet the requirements under the Brink 2H Programme”. In Mr Goh’s AEIC, he stated that he visited LND after Seagate’s confirmation of the B–N Alliance. However, this was not borne out as Seagate’s actual confirmation of the B–N Alliance came about only around 24 November 2011. Then, during the trial, Mr Goh’s evidence was that he visited LND in relation to the sale of BTEC. Ultimately, he conceded the “possibility of a tie-up” being discussed during the visit.
Mr Goh’s meeting with Seagate – 18 November 2011 
63     On 18 November 2011, Mr Goh met Seagate concerning the B–N Alliance. In advance of the meeting, on 16 November 2011, Mr Goh forwarded to Mr Toh Han Chiow (“Mr HC Toh”) a set of presentation slides which were to be used at the meeting. Mr HC Toh is the person Mr Billy Chua reported to within Seagate. Some of the salient points in the presentation slides included information on the substantial loss of equipment at BTT, such that there would be a “shortfall of HDD Base supply for the next 12 months due to shortage of [Computer Numerical Control (“CNC”)] machines and other related equipment for HDD industry”. CNC machines are critical for the Second Stage Work in the production of baseplates. More importantly, in the presentation slides, Mr Goh also pushed for the B–N Alliance.
Meeting of Seagate, the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group – 24 November 2011 
64     On 24 November 2011, representatives from Seagate, the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group met at the Seagate office. Seagate gave confirmation of the B–N Alliance.
Findings on the B–N Alliance 
65     Summing up, I have no doubt that Mr Goh was instrumental in the formation of the B–N Alliance, and ultimately the entry into the BAP–LND Contract. While Seagate might have initiated the concept and provided the final approval, Mr Goh, together with the NEDEC/KODEC Group, convinced Seagate to take this course of action, thus bringing on board the NEDEC/KODEC Group as a supplier of baseplates for Seagate HDDs.
Procuring the Seagate Grant
66     I now move on to Mr Goh’s role in procuring the US$2.5 million Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group. According to the First Plaintiff, Mr Goh procured the Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Mr Goh, however, claimed that he only included the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s request as part of the presentation slides to Seagate on 18 November 2011. Otherwise, it was Mr Tony Lee who obtained the Seagate Grant.
67     Contrary to Mr Goh’s stance, Mr Tony Lee testified that it was Mr Goh who first suggested the idea of the Seagate Grant to him. In an email sent to Mr Billy Chua on 29 October 2011 to update him on the 28 October 2011 meeting between Mr Goh and himself, Mr Tony Lee said that Mr Goh had “advised [him] to ask Seagate to cover [the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s] new tooling expenses which will shorten the necessary [lead time]”. During Mr Goh’s visit to LND on 10 November 2011, Mr Goh repeated this idea. In particular, during the car journey, Mr Goh “gave [them] the idea” of asking Seagate for a grant. Pursuant to this, Mr Goh was asked to assist the NEDEC/KODEC Group to act as an intermediary to obtain the Seagate Grant.
68     I note that after the LND visit, on 11 November 2011, Mr Tony Lee wrote to Mr Goh, stating that he was waiting “for good news from Seagate and from you.” In reply, Mr Goh said he had not talked to Mr HC Toh about the Seagate Grant yet, but would “talk money” at the “executive discussion” the following week. Thereafter, at the 18 November 2011 meeting between Mr Goh and Seagate, the presentation slides were used to push for the Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group. After the meeting, Mr Goh updated Mr Tony Lee and Mr Stephen Hwang via email with the news that Seagate had given the “go ahead” for the B–N Alliance. Mr Tony Lee replied and asked whether Seagate would be giving the NEDEC/KODEC Group any “concrete” assurance about the Seagate Grant. On 22 November 2011, Mr Goh told him “not worry for the US$2.5m, will get it”. In response, Mr Tony Lee said “so long as you gave us the sign of ‘OK’, I have no doubt about that, sir”. These emails, together with those at [67] above, form part of the recovered emails, and are contained in a thread with the subject matter heading “Re: B-N Alliance Issue”.
69     In my view, Mr Goh initiated the idea of seeking the Seagate Grant, strategised on how to secure it, and assisted the NEDEC/KODEC Group in obtaining it. In fact, Mr Tony Lee entrusted him with the task. On these aspects, Mr Tony Lee’s evidence is borne out by the email exchanges.
Payments under the Wyser Agreements
70     I next turn to the payments under the Wyser Agreements. Mr Goh admits that he received payments from the NEDEC/KODEC Group under the Wyser Agreements. It is also undisputed that these were not disclosed to the Board of Directors of the First Plaintiff. However, the parties disagree on the purpose of the Wyser Agreements. Mr Goh contends that the payments were purely for consultancy services he provided to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. The First Plaintiff characterises them as bribes. I now examine the transactions.
The draft Wyser Agreements
71     On 24 November 2011, a draft Wyser Agreement was forwarded by Mr Goh to Mr Tony Lee. Unfortunately, no copy of this was recovered. According to Mr Tony Lee, it contained a proposal to pay Mr Goh US$20,000 a month for the e-coated baseplates sent from the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, as well as a lump sum of US$200,000. Mr Tony Lee separated the terms of draft Wyser Agreement into two documents, and made certain amendments to them. Thereafter, on 20 February 2012, Mr Tony Lee sent Mr Goh the two revised draft Wyser Agreements. The first document provided for the payment of US$0.02 per e-coated baseplate supplied, rather than a lump sum of US$20,000 per month. It also provided for a payment of US$500,000 for Mr Goh’s assistance in securing the Seagate Grant. The second document provided that US$300,000 of the US$500,000 was to be paid out to Mr Stephen Hwang.
The finalised and executed Wyser Agreements
72     On 6 March 2012, the Wyser Agreements were finalised as three agreements. The terms of the Wyser Agreements are set out at [16]–[18]. In my view, it is clear from the natural language of the Wyser Agreements that the payment of money was for the “assistance [of Wyser International] in securing 6 million baseplates capacity business…for the Seagate Brink 2H program”, “supplying at least 1 million pieces of e-coated baseplates to Kodec” and “assist[ing] in securing a US$2.5 million as the co-sharing grant of fixture and tooling cost funded by Seagate”. Thus, Mr Goh and Wyser International were expressly required under the Wyser Agreements to assist the NEDEC/KODEC Group by obtaining business from Seagate, supplying e-coated baseplates to it and helping it secure the Seagate Grant.
73     Given the express wording of the Wyser Agreements, I find Mr Goh’s assertion that the payments were for his consultancy services in relation to the improvements required by the NEDEC/KODEC Group to be ludicrous. First, there is no mention of any consultancy services in the Wyser Agreements. If Mr Goh’s version was true, one would expect that the provision of consultancy services would be a key point to be captured. This is especially when Mr Goh had himself provided the draft Wyser Agreement to Mr Tony Lee on 24 November 2011. Although there were subsequent negotiations, there was nothing to show that Mr Goh objected to their contents.
74     Second, there is absolutely no reason for a consultancy fee to be tied to, and dependent on, the number of e-coated baseplates supplied by the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, as was the case under the First Wyser Agreement. Mr Goh explains that his original proposal was for US$20,000 per month to be paid to him, presumably as a flat fee for his consultancy services. He said that the payment of US$0.02 per piece was Mr Tony Lee’s idea. However, again, Mr Goh’s account is unbelievable. Mr Goh estimated that he would spend two to three days a month “resolving his mass production issue for the [NEDEC/KODEC Group’s] baseplate to be accepted by … Seagate”. Compared to his salary of S$45,000 to S$50,000 per month from the Beyonics Group, US$20,000 was an incredible amount for two to three days’ work per month. Instead, the US$20,000 per month proposal seems to accord with the intention that a minimum of one million pieces of e-coated baseplates was to be supplied to the NEDEC/KODEC Group per month, which at US$0.02 per piece works out to be US$20,000. This was precisely Mr Tony Lee’s evidence, which I prefer.
75     To support his contention that the US$200,000 under the Second Wyser Agreement was for his consultancy services, Mr Goh stated that he did little to assist in procuring the Seagate Grant. However, as discussed above, it is evident that he actively assisted in procuring the Seagate Grant, and the clear provisions of the Second Wyser Agreement provide that the payment of US$200,000 was for such assistance.
Findings on the Wyser Agreements 
76     Upon a review of the evidence, I find that it is patently clear that the Wyser Agreements provided for payments to Mr Goh for his assistance to the NEDEC/KODEC Group in securing business with Seagate, for the supply of e-coated baseplates and to procure the Seagate Grant. In my view, these are appropriately characterised as bribes. I should add that Mr Goh contends that if these were bribes, it would be “silly” of parties to document the transactions. Mr Tony Lee echoed such a sentiment. However, in cross-examination, Mr Goh did not deny that to deal with anti-money laundering concerns, banks might ask for proof to verify the validity of huge transfer of funds. While Mr Goh denied that he was preparing some legal documentation to support the transfer of funds in anticipation of any bank request, I note that in relation to the transfer of the sum of US$300,000 back to Mr Stephen Hwang, Mr Goh provided instructions to the bank, referring to it obliquely as being in relation to a “trade agreement”. Overall, I find that the fact that that the parties documented the transactions by way of the Wyser Agreements did not detract from their improper nature.
Facilitating the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate
77     With that, I move to the fourth and final area of Mr Goh’s alleged misconduct, which concerns his apparent facilitation of the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate. According to the First Plaintiff, after entry into the B–N Alliance and pursuant to the Wyser Agreements, Mr Goh continued to assist the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s development as a supplier of baseplates for Seagate HDDs. In particular, it is alleged that Mr Goh did the following:
(a)     Assisting and procuring the Beyonics Group to help with the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s qualification and performance of the Second Stage Work for Seagate HDDs.
(b)     Assisting the NEDEC/KODEC Group in developing the capability for First Stage Work for Seagate HDDs; and
(c)     Pushing for the sale of BTEC to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, which would have increased the production capabilities of the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
78     Mr Goh denies all of the above. His position is that the assistance rendered for the Second Stage Work was to ensure the smooth implementation of the B–N Alliance. Further, the NEDEC/KODEC Group already had the capability to perform First Stage Work, and he did not assist to build such capacity. As for the sale of BTEC, it was always subject to the approval of the First Plaintiff’s Board of Directors. I now deal with the alleged acts in turn.
Assistance to qualify and perform the Second Stage Work 
79     As arranged by Mr Goh, personnel from BTEC were sent to LND on 13 December 2011, 5 January, 14 February, 20 February, 12 April, 22 June, and 30 July 2012. LND’s personnel also visited facilities of BTEC and BPM. In his AEIC and during cross-examination, Mr Lee Leong Hua explained that during visits of BTEC to LND, assistance was provided as follows:
(a)      
13 December 2011.
 BTEC discussed and gave guidance on the production process plan (
ie
, the flow from raw casting to machining), engineering issues in relation to the Brinks 2H programme, Seagate’s audit process, and the machining process for the Second Stage Work.
(b)      
5 January 2012.
 Mr Lee Leong Hua went to the production floor and identified areas which did not meet Seagate’s requirements for the First and Second Stage Works, as well as areas which were experiencing bottlenecks.
(c)      
14 February 2012.
 BTEC personnel helped LND do “process mapping” of the production line to identify defects that were due to the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s inexperience with Second Stage Work.
80     In my view, it is clear that Mr Goh rendered assistance to the NEDEC/KODEC Group in relation to the Second Stage Work.
Assistance to develop capability to perform the First Stage Work 
81     Moreover, Mr Goh actively assisted the NEDEC/KODEC Group to develop its capabilities in e-coating, one of the key stages in the First Stage Work. For a start, I note that during a visit to LND on 5 January 2012, Mr Lee Leong Hua said that help was rendered to identify areas which did not meet Seagate’s requirements for both the First and Second Stage Works: see [79(b)]. In addition, there are two further points I wish to raise.
82     First, Mr Tony Lee and Mr Stephen Hwang were allowed to visit BPM facilities, particularly to view the e-coating facilities. In an email dated 4 March 2012, Mr Tony Lee requested to see BPM’s e-coating factory on 7 March 2012, as the NEDEC/KODEC Group was “really lack[ing] [an] e-coating facility”. In a reply email on the same day, Mr Goh agreed to the visit and stated that “[he] will advise on the ecoating facility”.
83     Second, Mr Goh also acted as an intermediary between Mr Tony Lee and two vendors to discuss the design of a new “ED Coating Line” for use by KPI, a subsidiary of KODEC, based in the Philippines. The ED Coating Line was to be developed with the specific goal of satisfying Seagate’s requirements. Mr Goh sent the vendors the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s design requirements, had discussions with them, and requested for quotations. It was clear that Mr Goh took an active interest in assisting with the development of the e-coating capabilities of the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
84     Mr Goh tried to downplay his role by stating that his role as an intermediary was but a “five minutes job”, and that it was “industry practice” to help develop another manufacturer’s e-coating plant. Also, at the end of the day, the NEDEC/KODEC Group did not purchase the ED Coating Line from the two vendors. Nonetheless, at the relevant time, the NEDEC/KODEC Group was still reliant on the Beyonics Group for e-coating capabilities. There was simply no reason for Mr Goh to be assisting a direct competitor to strengthen its e-coating facilities.
Sale of BTEC 
85     Further, the First Plaintiff’s position is that Mr Goh was instrumental in pushing for the sale of BTEC, one of the Beyonics Group’s largest manufacturing plants, to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, in negotiations which were not at arm’s length. Mr Goh disagrees. He explained that there was nothing untoward about the proposed sale of BTEC, as it was in line with the Beyonics Group’s general policy to divest the PE Division.
86     I note that as early as 26 October 2011, before the NEDEC/KODEC Group had even met Seagate in Singapore, Mr Tony Lee emailed Mr Goh to express interest in the “Changsu (
sic
) factory”, 
ie
, BTEC. He claimed in that e-mail that this was “another alternative solution for [the NEDEC/KODEC Group] because [it is] currently expanding… [its] HDD business”. Mr Tony Lee explained at trial that this “alternative solution” involved the NEDEC/KODEC Group buying BTEC so that BTEC can do the First Stage Work for the former as well. It should have been clear to Mr Goh that by acquiring BTEC, the NEDEC/KODEC Group would strengthen its capability for First Stage Work.
87     Thereafter, there was frequent correspondence between Mr Tony Lee and Mr Goh on the sale of BTEC which amounted to a promise by Mr Goh to deal exclusively with the NEDEC/KODEC Group. On 3 January 2012, Mr Goh informed Mr Tony Lee that he had rejected SEMCO, another interested buyer of BTEC, which Tony Lee lauded as a “superb strategy”. At Mr Tony Lee’s request to reject all other buyers and to consider the NEDEC/KODEC Group as a “top priority as agreed [in a meeting in Suzhou on 10 January 2012]” (where the BAP–LND Contract was signed), Mr Goh duly so promised.
88     In addition, Mr Goh quoted a “friend price” of US$40 million to Mr Tony Lee for the sale of BTEC, which was apparently below the US$50 million the Beyonics Group would have charged SEMCO. Mr Goh also engaged in extensive discussions with Mr Tony Lee, even proposing options for financing the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s acquisition of BTEC.
89     I should also add that Mr Tony Lee informed Mr Billy Chua of the intended disposition to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. In my view, regardless of whether there was a policy to divest the PE Division, Mr Goh clearly favoured the NEDEC/KODEC Group when attempting to sell BTEC. This led to Business Development Asia LLC (“BDA”) being engaged to be agents for the sale of PE Division, and to Mr Shaw telling Mr Goh in no uncertain terms that all discussions should go through BDA and that Mr Shaw should also be informed. Specifically, Mr Shaw told Mr Goh that this “includes Nedec [which does not have] exclusivity at this time”. Eventually, the NEDEC/KODEC Group did not purchase BTEC.
Findings on facilitating the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate
90     To sum up, I find that Mr Goh further assisted the NEDEC/KODEC Group to build its capabilities, for both the First and Second Stages of Work, and favoured the NEDEC/KODEC Group when attempting to sell BTEC. The assistance went beyond what was required to implement the B–N Alliance.
Mr Goh’s explanations for his actions
91     Having dealt with the factual disputes regarding whether the alleged acts were committed, I go to the Defendants’ broad argument that considered in light of the surrounding circumstances, especially the four matters discussed below, Mr Goh acted in the best interests of the Beyonics Group at all times.
Limited investment in the PE Division
92     First, the Defendants assert that it has long been the policy of the Beyonics Group to make limited investments and to divest the PE Division which was sustaining losses. This allegedly explains Mr Goh’s efforts to dispose of BTEC and his withholding of investments in the PE Division at the material time.
93     In the email dated 27 October 2011 from Mr Goh to Mr Billy Chua, ten minutes before the first meeting between Seagate and the NEDEC/KODEC Group, Mr Goh mentioned the Beyonics Group’s “limited investment strategy”: see [56]. Mr Goh claims that this strategy had been decided on by the First Plaintiff’s Board of Directors, referring to minutes of meeting of the Board of Directors on 13 December 2011. However, these minutes simply recorded that Mr Goh briefed the Board of Directors on the situation after the Thailand floods, and stated that “as we had decided on limited investments to the PES division, we informed [the HDD OEMs] that they have to provide us with some financial assistance”. The minutes did not shed light on when and by whom this decision was made. In any case, the email of 27 October 2011 was sent before the 13 December 2011 meeting, and Mr Goh could not have been relying on the minutes at that earlier time.
94     Separately, Mr Goh stated that the decision to make limited investments in the PE Division was made more than ten years ago. In fact, when Mr Goh first joined the Beyonics Group in 2000, the PE Division was already incurring losses. The Board of Directors had decided then to divest the PE Division. During the period in which he was CEO, limited investments were made to the PE Division. However, Mr Goh accepted that there was no record of any such decision by the Board of Directors placed before the court.
95     This matter was not pleaded in the Defence or raised in Mr Goh’s AEIC. Such a late introduction of a crucial allegation itself casts doubt on the truth of that allegation. Nonetheless, I will proceed to deal with the merits of the argument. The claim that there was a decision more than ten years ago to make limited investment in the PE Division is contradicted by the acquisition of BTEC in 2004. Further, a substantial shareholding in Wealth Preview, also a subsidiary within the PE Division (see [5(c)]), was acquired only in 2008. I therefore do not accept that there was a clear decision made by the Board of Directors of the First Plaintiff to make limited investments in the PE Division such a long time ago.
96     Even if there was such an earlier decision, given the situation which presented itself after the floods in Thailand, it was incumbent on Mr Goh, as CEO, to consider the appropriate strategy and recommend the best course forward purely in the interests of the Beyonics Group. However, he decided not to indicate commitment and support to Seagate, forged ahead with the B–N Alliance, accepted the payments under the Wyser Agreements and continued to pursue the sale of BTEC rather than consider whether it should be kept within the Beyonics Group, given the loss of BTT. No specific approval was sought from the Board of Directors.
Production capacity for Second Stage Work
97     Second, Mr Goh contends that the B–N Alliance was for the benefit of Beyonics Group because BTEC had already maximised its production capacity, and could not have undertaken both stages of work. A “realistic maximum production capacity” of BTEC was only about 2.5 to 2.6 million units per month. The First Plaintiff takes a contrary position, and contends that BTEC had the capacity to produce about 3.5 to 3.6 million baseplates per month, and thus had sufficient capacity to carry out the Second Stage Work on the one million e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Further, BTEC could have taken steps to ramp up production, or make capital investments to increase its capacity to meet Seagate’s demands. Once again, Mr Goh’s line of argument in relation to production capacity was not pleaded in the Amended Defence. However, it was raised in Mr Goh’s AEIC, as well as the AEICs of the First Plaintiff’s witnesses, and dealt with extensively at the trial. Thus, I proceed to deal with matter on its merits.
Overall assessment of production capacity
98     I start by reviewing four documents created near the time of entry into the B–N Alliance regarding BTEC’s production capacity, as well as a series of emails from Mr Lee Leong Hua to Mr Goh from 11 November 2011 to 17 November 2011 (collectively referred to as the “What-If Analysis emails”).
The PE Memo
99     The first document is the “Project PE – Information Memorandum” (“the PE Memo”) dated 23 November 2011. This was sent by Mr Goh to Mr Shaw on 31 January 2012. The PE Memo stated that the PE Division “has the necessary machinery and equipment in the Die Casting, E-Coating and Precision Machining processes [
ie
, both the First and Second Stage Works] with high capacities” and this enables “the PE Division to manage high volume of orders from customers”. It also stated that BTEC had 259 CNC Machines with a capacity of producing 3.5 million units per month.
100    The PE Memo was prepared by Mr Goh for distribution to potential buyers of the PE Division. A copy of this was provided to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Relying on this document, the First Plaintiff contends that with the purchase of 10 more CNC machines in February 2012 (a fact which was undisputed), the machining capacity should proportionately increase to approximately 3.64 million baseplates per month, which would more than adequately cover the Second Stage Work on the one million e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
101    In cross-examination, Mr Goh explained that at the material time, he had accepted the figure of 3.5 million in the PE Memo as accurate, as the information had been provided by the engineering personnel. However, he disassociated himself from the figure by claiming that it was based on a “theoretical maximum” of CNC machining capacity, and that the “realistic maximum” production capacity was only 2.5 to 2.6 million, about a million units fewer than what was stated in the PE Memo. Therefore, BTEC could not carry out the Second Stage Work on one million pieces of e-coated baseplates per month. Instead of the PE Memo, Mr Goh asked that weight be given to the following three documents instead.
The Draft capacity analysis
102    The next document is the “Draft Capacity Analysis” sent by Mr Lee Leong Hua on 14 March 2012 to the financial controller of the Beyonics Group. This was prepared by Mr Lee Leong Hua for the purpose of a management meeting at the instructions of Mr Goh. The Draft Capacity Analysis stated that BTEC’s machining capacity, based on 247 CNC machines, was 2.36 million. However, this did not take into account a remaining 22 CNC machines at BTEC. It was also prepared on the basis of a five-day work week, and 22 working hours per day, and did not reflect the maximum capacity of BTEC.
The Changshu Capacity Matrix
103    The “Changshu Capacity Matrix” was sent on 7 June 2012 by Mr Lee Leong Hua to Mr Mueller. After BDA was engaged as agents for the sale of the PE Division, it requested some information from the Beyonics Group, including the Changshu Capacity Matrix which Mr Lee Leong Hua filled in. The Changshu Capacity Matrix stated that BTEC had 269 CNC machines with a “theoretical capacity” of 100,000 baseplates daily, and that the current capacity utilisation rate was 88%. This was on the assumption of a 26-day working plan. Therefore, BTEC had a machining capacity of 2.6 million baseplates per month.
104    At the trial, Mr Lee Leong Hua explained that the calculation did not take into account that there were 66 unused spare CNC machines available at BTEC. Instead, the calculation was based only on those CNC machines which were running at that point in time. Assuming that these 66 unused spare CNC machines were also used for the Second Stage Work for Brinks 2H baseplates, approximately 1.16 million additional Brinks 2H baseplates could be produced. Therefore, the total machining capacity would be approximately 3.76 million baseplates per month. On this, I accept Mr Lee Leong Hua’s evidence that the Changshu Capacity Matrix did not reflect the maximum production capacity of BTEC.
The BDA Memo
105    Next, I turn to the confidential information memorandum prepared by BDA (“the BDA Memo”) dated June 2012. In the section entitled “[c]apacity and production”, it was stated that BTEC had an annual machining capacity of 36 million baseplates, or a monthly machining capacity of 3 million baseplates. These figures are stated to be on the assumption that “all capacity is used for production of baseplates”. However, Mr Shaw explained that these figures were conservative, as the BDA Memo was meant to be a document for the sale of BTEC. While the Beyonics Group understood from the PE Memo that the capacity was 3.5 million, they were agreeable for BDA to use the more conservative estimate of 3 million. I accept the explanation by Mr Shaw.
The What-If Analysis Emails
106    The What-If Analysis emails started with Mr Goh’s email on 11 November 2011 at 9.25am to Mr Lee Leong Hua and others stating that he would be asking Seagate for funding, and requesting Mr Lee Leong Hua to “do the calculation” on BTEC’s baseplate production capacity. On the same day at 1.21pm, Mr Lee Leong Hua emailed Mr Goh stating that he would require a capital investment of US$4.18 million (to purchase new machines, jigs and fixtures) to meet the proposed monthly production plan of 1.1 million Seagate baseplates, 1.9 million Hitachi baseplates, 300,000 automotive parts and one million e-coated baseplates for the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Mr Goh claims that this shows that BTEC required large sums of capital investments to increase its production capacity to meet the proposed production plans.
107    However, Mr Leong Lee Hua explained that his computation was done on the basis that BTEC did not have any existing equipment or machinery which could be used for production. In fact, it was not necessary to invest in more CNC machines as there were unused CNC machines at BTEC. Instead, he opined in his AEIC that only a small investment for tools and fixtures was required for the Beyonics Group to carry out the Second Stage Work on the one million e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
108    Although US$4.18 million was requested by Mr Lee Leong Hua, at the meeting with Seagate on 18 November 2011, Mr Goh asked for twice the amount in the presentation slides, being US$8.8 million. In my view, the What-If Analysis Emails were prepared for the basis of getting investments from Seagate. For that purpose, they reflected the full extent of equipment and investments that the Beyonics Group would like to have. However, little weight should be placed on What-If Analysis Emails to establish what the BTEC really required, much less be relied on to conclude that there was a lack of capacity on the part of BTEC.
Findings on documents on the overall assessment of production capacity
109    Based on the documentary and other evidence discussed above, I agree with the First Plaintiff that the information stated in the PE Memo appears to be the most reliable. It was originally endorsed by Mr Goh. Further, I note that the PE Memo was prepared closest in time to the entry into the B–N Alliance. As pointed out by the First Plaintiff, the timing of the documents was important as the overall capacity of a factory is not static and would vary depending on the mix of programmes being run by BTEC. The information in the PE Memo is thus more probative than that contained in other documents.
Objective evidence of the capacity of the CNC machines
110    More importantly, the above documents show that of the many factors which determined the production capacity of BTEC, the most crucial factor was the numerical sufficiency of CNC machines. This factor featured in all the documents discussed and was confirmed to be critical by Mr Lee Leong Hua.
111    The First Plaintiff sought to provide objective evidence that BTEC had a sufficient number of CNC machines to carry out the additional Second Stage Work, especially from January 2012 to January 2013, the period during which e-coated baseplates were diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
(a)     First, Mr Lee Leong Hua referred to the BTEC weekly output reports and computed the number of CNC machines utilised at BTEC on a weekly basis. Deducting the number of utilised CNC machines from the total number of CNC machines at BTEC (which was 269), he then derived the number of CNC machines 
not
 utilised on a weekly basis. This computation consistently showed that there were unused CNC machines at BTEC.
(b)     Second, according to Mr Lee Leong Hua, each CNC machine would be able to produce about 600 Brinks 2H baseplates per day. On this basis, he computed the additional output by BTEC should the spare CNC machines be put to use.
(c)     Third, from the Oracle records system of the Beyonics Group, Mr Lee Leong Hua extracted information to obtain the number of e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group in the corresponding period.
(d)     Fourth, the First Plaintiff relied on another set of documents known as BTEC’s weekly production reports which contained, 
inter alia
, the actual total production figures for each BTEC baseplate programme. Extracting from the weekly production reports, the First Plaintiff tabulated BTEC’s actual monthly production figures.
112    At the trial, the information for the first three items was collated into Exh P13, and presented on a monthly basis. As for the fourth item, the information was presented in Exh P15. For ease of reference, I reproduce the information from these two exhibits for January 2012 to January 2013:

113    Even at a glance, it is clear from the figures in the table that BTEC had more than enough machining capacity to carry out the Second Stage Work for one million e-coated baseplates a month that were diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. I should also add that at the time of Mr Goh’s email to Mr Billy Chua on 27 October 2011 at 8.50am (which was Week 43 of 2011), there were 131 unutilised CNC machines at BTEC. There did not seem to be any reason to think that BTEC did not have sufficient machining capacity then.
114    It is important to note that the Defendants did not challenge the figures presented in Mr Lee Leong Hua’s AEIC, Exh P13 or Exh P15. In fact, after considering the documents, Mr Ng Lip Chih admitted that they were substantially correct. Therefore, I accept that these computations from the source documents were accurate. Even on another set of source documents known as BTEC’s weekly production and manpower status reports, which the Defendants relied on, it is also clear that there were spare CNC machines at BTEC. However, the First Plaintiff explained that there was no complete record of these reports across the relevant period, and thus the Plaintiffs did not choose to rely on them. Nonetheless, the computation based on the weekly production and manpower status reports was produced as Exh P14 at trial.
115    At the end of the day, it is clear that the Defendants did not dispute that there were a substantial number of spare CNC machines at BTEC. Instead, the Defendants put forth a few arguments as to why these spare CNC machines could not be utilised to perform the Second Stage Work as follows:
(a)     First, CNC Machines are committed to producing baseplates for a particular programme for a specific customer, such that when the customer’s demand for baseplates for that particular programme decreases, the machines are left idle and cannot be used to carry out work for a different programme without the customer’s consent. I do not find this claim believable. In fact, Mr Billy Chua stated that Seagate does not require customers to commit specific CNC machines to them. Mr Lee Leong Hua also stated that if a customer’s order does not use up the allocated machines, then the unused machines are available for another customer’s use. From the tabulation of the machines allocated to Seagate, Hitachi and other customers of BTEC, it was also clear that the number of machines allocated to each customer changed significantly from one week to another.
(b)     Next, the time taken to reconfigure a CNC machine to undertake work for a different programme is substantial, with an average of six months’ lead time required. However, in contrast, Mr Goh said that the NEDEC/KODEC Group could have converted the CNC machine programming from a Samsung programme to a Seagate programme relatively quickly in two months. These contradictory positions render the argument on lead time unbelievable.
(c)     Third, the older CNC machines can only be used for pre-machining works, and are unsuitable to be used for machining which requires more precision in Second Stage Work. Therefore, using older CNC machines for machining work could create quality issues, and BTEC did not factor in the older machines in planning for production. These matters were not raised at all by Mr Goh until the cross-examination of Mr Lee Leong Hua. In any case, Mr Lee Leong Hua explained that while BTEC generally deployed older CNC machines for pre-machining works as there were spare CNC machines, it did not mean that they could not be used for machining work. I accept his evidence.
(d)     Fourth, again during the cross-examination of Mr Lee Leong Hua, it was contended that any unused CNC could not be reallocated to perform the Second Stage Work because BTEC was required to keep unused machines to provide for an “upside flexibility” in orders of up to 30%. However, Mr Goh himself conceded that this was not a position that the Beyonics Group adopted. I thus did not place any weight on this argument.
116    Based on the foregoing, I find that there were spare CNC machines at BTEC which could have been put to use to carry out the Second Stage Work on the e-coated baseplates supplied to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.
Other constraints to production capacity 
117    Undoubtedly, production capacity is also affected by a host of other, albeit less critical, factors. The other constraints to production raised by Mr Goh include (a) the washing capacity of the washing lines (washing being a process that takes place after machining during the Second Stage Work); (b) the sufficiency of tools, fixtures and cutters (which are to be fitted to the CNC machines and other machines); (c) the quality of baseplates produced at BTEC; and (d) manpower. Mr Goh contends that in deriving the production capacity from the spare CNC machines as shown in Exh P13, Mr Lee Leong Hua had failed to take into account these matters.
118    I do not propose to go into these other factors in detail. Having reviewed the evidence, I find that BTEC had sufficient washing capacity. As for the tools, fixtures and cutters, these can be acquired quickly and required minimal capital investments, so any shortfall would not have been an obstacle to taking on the Second Stage Work. There were no major quality issues at BTEC. As for manpower, I accept that there was manpower shortage not just during Chinese New Year in 2011 (as conceded by the First Plaintiff), but also in April 2012. However, the Defendants have not adduced sufficient evidence to show that this manpower shortage was persistent (
ie
, extended beyond the isolated incidents highlighted) such as to have a real impact on the production capacity of BTEC. On the whole, I find Mr Goh’s allegations were largely unsubstantiated and not borne out by the evidence.
Findings on production capacity
119    Based on the above, I accept that at the critical period when Seagate was anxious about the supply crunch, there were spare CNC machines at BTEC which could have been utilised. In the circumstances, I accept that the Beyonics Group, and specifically BTEC itself, had the capacity to perform the Second Stage Work on the e-coated baseplates supplied to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. BTEC could also have ramped up the number of production days from 26 days to 30 days a month, so as to increase production capacity. I accept that there might have been some investments required for equipment other than CNC machines, and note that Mr Lee Leong Hua candidly admitted that he thought some level of investment would have been necessary to perform the Second Stage Work (see [107]). However, compared to CNC machines, the other equipment would not be as costly. In this regard, I note that around December 2011, a total of US$1.1 million was paid by Seagate to BTEC, a sum which included payments for the costs of tools and fixtures so as to increase capacity for the manufacture of baseplates for Seagate. The receipt of this sum was not disputed by the Defendants. This amount is nearly a quarter of the sum of US$4.18 million investment originally estimated by Mr Lee Leong Hua in the What-If Analysis emails, which, it must be recalled, was made on the basis that that BTEC did not have any existing equipment or machinery that could be used for production at all. This grant should have gone a long way to make any further investments required to perform Second Stage Work for Seagate. In any case, I shall return to the issue of investments required below at [121].
The B–N Alliance was not unique
120    Third, Mr Goh contends that the B–N Alliance was one of several partnerships after the Thailand floods. Apart from the pairing of the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group, there were also two pairings of other suppliers, namely between MMI and Shinsung, and between Nidec and Foxconn. Thus, there was nothing improper about entering into the B–N Alliance. However, I note that Seagate dealt with these partnerships only 
after
 the B–N Alliance. While Mr Goh’s presentation to Seagate was on 18 November 2011 and the confirmation of the B–N Alliance was on 24 November 2011, presentations for the other pairings took place only in early 2012. In any case, these pairings do not detract from the fact that Mr Goh acted to persuade and convince Seagate to proceed with the B–N Alliance without pitching for the Beyonics Group to perform the Second Stage Work. The fact that there were other pairings between suppliers does not strengthen Mr Goh’s stance that he acted in the best interests of the Beyonics Group.
Benefits procured by Mr Goh for the Beyonics Group
121    Finally, Mr Goh argues that although he had in the 18 November 2011 presentation slides to Seagate included a request for the US$2.5 million Seagate Grant for the NEDEC/KODEC Group, he had also made a request on behalf of the Beyonics Group for an US$8.8 million investment, and eventually obtained a grant of US$1.7 million for it. However, I am more persuaded by the First Plaintiff’s contention that the effect of the presentation was that the Beyonics Group appeared to require a much larger investment from Seagate (twice that of Mr Lee Leong Hua’s generous estimate in the What-If Analysis emails), while the NEDEC/KODEC Group was willing to ramp up production for a much smaller investment of US$2.5 million. It was in that context that the US$1.7 million grant was provided.
122    Further, Mr Goh took credit for obtaining from Seagate a “cost adder”, which was a premium paid to the suppliers in addition to the sale price for a particular period. However, it appears that at the material time, Seagate paid a cost adder to all its existing suppliers; it was not something which Mr Goh would have had to specifically negotiate for. For this reason, Mr Goh cannot rely on this as evidence that he acted in the best interests of the Beyonics Group at all times.
Findings on Mr Goh’s explanations
123    Finally, it was highlighted that Mr Goh had a “significant shareholding” of 6.47% in the First Plaintiff after the acquisition by Channelview. Therefore, there was allegedly no reason for him to prefer the growth of the NEDEC/KODEC Group as a competitor to the Beyonics Group. In my view, as a minority shareholder, Mr Goh had very little control over the dividends payable to him. By contrast, in collaborating with the NEDEC/KODEC Group, he was in a position to negotiate for and obtain personal benefits. Considering the evidence on these points in their totality, I am not persuaded by Mr Goh’s explanations that his actions were taken in the best interests of the Beyonics Group.
Whether Mr Goh breached his duties
124    Based on my findings above, I am of the view that Mr Goh’s actions were in breach of the four main fiduciary duties set out at [40]. For completeness, I also find that he has breached the statutory duties set out in ss 156 and 157 of the Companies Act.
125    First, it is clear that Mr Goh failed to act honestly and 
bona fide
 in the best interest of the First Plaintiff. Quite the contrary, Mr Goh had acted in the interests and for the benefit of the NEDEC/KODEC Group, a direct competitor of the Beyonics Group. In the critical time after the Thailand floods, it was in the Beyonics Group’s best interest to secure the trust of Seagate, one of its largest clients, and to assure Seagate of its support in order to continue its business with Seagate. Mr Goh, however, under-represented the Beyonics Group’s capacity and readily endorsed the B–N Alliance even when the Beyonics Group had sufficient production capacity to carry out the Second Stage Work, thus effecting a diversion of e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Further, Mr Goh played an instrumental role in initiating and assisting the NEDEC/KODEC Group to procure the US$2.5 million Seagate Grant. Finally, he continued to facilitate the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate, assisting with its qualification and performance of the Second Stage Work, developing its capacity to carry out the First Stage Work, and giving it preferential treatment in the sale of BTEC. While the sale of BTEC did not materialise, news of this leaked to Seagate. The culmination of Mr Goh’s actions was that Seagate was given the impression that the Beyonics Group was not committed to the business with Seagate, while the NEDEC/KODEC Group was more than ready for it.
126    In addition, in playing an active role in the B–N Alliance, Mr Goh created a conflict between his duty to the First Plaintiff and his personal interest. His duty to the Beyonics Group was to help to seize opportunities for it. However, this conflicted with his personal interest to build on his relationship with the NEDEC/KODEC Group, a competitor of the Beyonics Group, and to explore opportunities for his own pecuniary benefit under the Wyser Agreements. Indeed, all of Mr Goh’s actions were tainted by the receipt of the payments under the Wyser Agreements, which I have characterised as bribes.
127    In receiving the payments under the Wyser Agreements, Mr Goh has also breached the duty against taking secret profit and improper payments. The acceptance of the bribes is the clearest instance of the conflict between his duty to the First Plaintiff and his personal interest. The prohibition against taking secret bribes is a strict one. The very fact of the bribe is a clear breach of fiduciary duty: see John McGhee gen ed, 
Snell’s Equity
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“
Snell’s Equity
”) at para 7-047.
128    Finally, Mr Goh did not disclose any of his above actions, least of all the payments under the Wyser Agreements, to the Board of Directors of the First Plaintiff. In fact, he hid his correspondence with the NEDEC/KODEC Group from the First Plaintiff by deleting a large number of incriminating emails which had to be recovered.
Whether the breaches caused the losses
Legal principles on causation
129    Having found that Mr Goh breached the fiduciary duties owed to the First Plaintiff, the next question is whether he 
caused
 the losses to the First Plaintiff. Bearing in mind that the First Plaintiff seeks equitable compensation, it is appropriate to discuss the applicable legal principles of causation in this context.
130    The Plaintiffs analyse this legal issue in their closing submissions. They submit that where there is a clear fiduciary relationship, and grave and culpable breaches of the core fiduciary obligations of honesty and fidelity, the legal test for causation is less stringent than the common law “but for” test, such that it would suffice to show that the losses sustained were “in some way connected” to the fiduciary’s breach of duties. Further or in the alternative, equity may require a shifting of the evidential burden to the fiduciary. Once the plaintiff adduces some evidence to connect the breach to the loss, the evidential burden would shift to the fiduciary to show that the plaintiff would have incurred those losses even if there had been no breach by the fiduciary. In contrast, the Defendants do not address the law regarding causation at all.
131    At the outset, I note that it is clear that “there is no equitable by-pass of the need to establish causation” (
Swindle v Harrison
 [1997] 4 All ER 705 at 733); that is, the breach of fiduciary duties must have caused the loss before equitable compensation can be awarded. The more controversial issue is whether the strict common law “but for” test applies, and if not, what the less strict test is. In two recent High Court decisions of 
Quality Assurance
 and 
Then Khek Koon v Arjun Permanad Samtani
 
[2014] 1 SLR 245
 (“
Then Khek Koon
”), this area is considered in detail. As set out in these two cases, generally, there are two differing approaches.
132    The first approach is contained in the English House of Lords decision of 
Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns
 
[1996] 1 AC 421
 (“
Target Holdings
”), which applied the traditional “but for” test of causation. In 
Target Holdings
, the plaintiff finance company agreed to provide a loan of £1.5 million to a borrower on the security of a commercial property to be bought by the latter. The borrower had provided a professional valuation of the property at £2 million. The £1.5 million loan was transferred by the finance company to its solicitors. It was common ground that the solicitors were not to transfer the money to the borrower until the conveyance was completed and a charge over the commercial property in favour of the finance company was executed. However, in breach of trust, the solicitors paid away a large portion of the money prematurely to the borrower, before the completion of the conveyance, and without first securing the charge (both of which only took place some days later). Unknown to the finance company, the borrower fraudulently obtained an excessively high valuation of the property. It defaulted on the loan, and the property was sold at a loss. The finance company brought a claim against the solicitors for, 
inter alia
, breach of trust. The solicitors claimed that because of the borrower’s fraud (to which they were not party), the breach of trust left the finance company in exactly the same position as it would have been had there been no breach. Thus, the breach of trust by the solicitors could not be said to have 
caused
 the loss ultimately suffered by the finance company, as the loss would have been suffered in any event.
133    The House of Lords in 
Target Holdings
 at 434 highlighted that the fiduciary’s breach of duty must be a “but for” cause of the plaintiff’s loss. In other words, “even if the immediate cause of the loss is the dishonesty or failure of a third party, the trustee is liable to make good that loss to the trust estate if, 
but for the breach, such loss would not have occurred
 ... [T]here does have to be some causal connection between the breach of trust and the loss to the trust estate for which compensation is recoverable, viz. 
the fact that the loss would not have occurred but for the breach
” [emphasis added]. On the facts of 
Target Holdings
, the House of Lords held that the “but for” test of causation was not made out as the finance company would be in exactly the same position if no breach of trust had occurred. It was thus not entitled to any equitable compensation from the solicitors.
134    By way of contrast, in the Privy Council decision of 
Brickenden v London Loan & Savings Co of Canada
 [1934] 3 DLR 465 (“
Brickenden
”), a less strict approach to causation appeared to be favoured. A solicitor had lent money to a mortgagor in return for three mortgages. He acted for both a finance company and the mortgagor in a refinancing transaction, where the finance company advanced a loan to the mortgagor against a new mortgage. The solicitor retained part of the loan advanced to discharge the existing mortgages which he held personally. He only disclosed to the finance company one of the three prior mortgages. When the mortgagor defaulted on repayment, the finance company sued the solicitor for breaching his fiduciary duty in failing to disclose his personal interest in the transaction. The solicitor was held liable to compensate the finance company for the losses suffered as a result of the mortgagor’s default.

 at [43] interprets 
Brickenden
 as authority for the proposition that a claim for equitable compensation will succeed so long as the wronged party can show that the fiduciary’s breach of duty is “
in some way connected
” to the loss, even if it simply sets the occasion for the loss rather than being the cause of the loss in any legal sense.
135    Based on an analysis of 
Target Holdings
, 
Brickenden
 and other authorities, 
Quality Assurance
 and 
Then Khek Koon
 classified breaches of fiduciary duties into different categories. It is held that the less strict approach in 
Brickenden
 “should and does apply with full stringency, at the very least, to: (a) a fiduciary who is in one of the well-established categories of fiduciary relationships; (b) who commits a culpable breach; (c) who breaches an obligation which stands at the very core of the fiduciary relationship”: 
Quality Assurance
 at [56]. Provided that the three conditions are satisfied, a fiduciary is liable to pay equitable compensation even if the 
principal
 is unable to prove “but for” causation: 
Then Khek Koon
 at [108(b)]. In other scenarios, the principal still has to satisfy the strict “but for” causation. In other words, the test of causation in the context of equitable compensation is not uniform. As the other scenarios are not relevant to the present facts, it is not necessary for me to deal with them.
136    In relation to the less strict approach to causation in 
Brickenden
, 
Quality Assurance
 makes clear that, contrary to a literal reading of the former (as stated at [134]), the fiduciary is not 
immediately
 liable for all losses once the principal successfully proves that the breach is “in some way connected” to the loss. Instead, there is thereafter a shift of the evidential burden to the fiduciary to prove that “but for” his breach of fiduciary duties, the loss would still have occurred. Once the principal adduces 
some
 evidence to connect the breach to the loss, the evidential burden on causation shifts to the breaching fiduciary. Bearing in mind this burden-shifting function of the 
Brickenden
 rule, the statement in 
Then Khek Koon
 at [108(b)] (quoted in the preceding paragraph) that liability can be established even if the 
principal
 is unable to prove “but for” causation should not be understood as dispensing with the need for “but for” causation altogether. In addition, where the 
Brickenden
 rule applies, causation will be determined shorn of the rules of foreseeability, remoteness and 
novus actus interveniens
. There will also be no examination of the contributory fault of other parties: 
Quality Assurance
 at [61].
137    For the purpose of the present case, I adopt the propositions set out in [135]–[136]. I note that this approach is in line with earlier local cases. In 
John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd v Goh Sai Chuah Justin
 
[2004] 3 SLR(R) 596
 (“
John While Springs
”) at [5]), the High Court interpreted 
Kumagai-Zenecon Construction Pte Ltd v Low Hua Kin
 
[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1049
 (“
Kumagai-Zenecon
”) at [35], and held that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the losses and damages suffered are “caused by or linked to” the breaches of fiduciary duties. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the fiduciary to show that the plaintiff would have incurred those losses even if there had been no breach. In my view, where there is a culpable breach of a core duty of a well-established category of fiduciary relationship, the burden-shifting function of the 
Brickenden
 rule is sensible in that it does not hold the fiduciary liable for all losses linked in some way to his breach (as would occur if the fiduciary was not afforded the chance of exonerating himself from liability), but nonetheless deters breaches of core fiduciary duties. A fiduciary has been said to owe to his principal “the highest standard [of duty] known to the law” (see 
Kumagai-Zenecon
 at [13]). Thus, where the fiduciary acts in derogation from his core obligation of single-minded loyalty to his principal and prefers his own interest, the principal should not have to bear the heavy burden of proving strict “but for” causation.
The Diversion Loss
138    Having set out the legal principles, I turn to the issue of whether Mr Goh’s breaches caused the Diversion Loss. The Defendants’ argument is that the Beyonics Group did not have capacity to carry out Second Stage Work on the e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Therefore – the Defendants argue – the Diversion Loss would still have been suffered in any event. I reject this argument, having earlier concluded that BTEC had production capacity for the Second Stage Work. Thus, Mr Goh’s misconduct directly caused the Diversion Loss suffered, and causation is established even on the strict “but for” standard. For completeness, I should add that 
a fortiori
, causation would also be established on the less stringent 
Brickenden
 standard, which can be applied given that this case quite clearly falls within the remit of 
Brickenden
 (see further, [153] below).
The Total Loss
139    Next, I consider whether the breaches of Mr Goh’s fiduciary duties caused the Total Loss suffered. In this context, I note that the First Plaintiff’s quantification for the Total Loss included the decline in baseplates sales to Seagate from FY 2012 to the beginning of FY 2014, and the total loss of business with Seagate from FY 2014 onwards.
140    Mr Goh argues that in any event, Seagate was intending to consolidate its baseplate suppliers and ultimately to remove the Beyonics Group as a supplier. Further, the Total Loss can also be attributed to the mismanagement of the Seagate account by the First Plaintiff’s executives who took over from Mr Goh at the end of 2012, after the acquisition by Channelview. Thus, Mr Goh contends that the Total Loss would still have been suffered in the absence of his breaches.
141    On the other hand, the First Plaintiff argues that while there appears to be a multitude of factors behind Seagate’s decision to terminate the Beyonics Group as a supplier of baseplates, ultimately, the decision was based on one key factor: the contrasting levels of commitment shown by the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group. It was Mr Goh’s misconduct which led to this disparity. Therefore, the First Plaintiff argues that the “but for” test is satisfied. In the alternative, the First Plaintiff submits that Mr Goh’s breaches were of his core duties as a fiduciary, and therefore the less stringent test of causation in 
Brickenden
 can be applied. The burden shifts to Mr Goh to show that the Total Loss would have been suffered independent of his breaches, and he is unable to do so.
142    Having set out the parties’ positions, I turn to some further evidence concerning the termination of the Beyonics Group as a supplier to Seagate. I first refer to four sets of presentation slides prepared by Mr Billy Chua for the purpose of discussing the outlook of Seagate’s baseplate commodity strategy with its management. From these, it is apparent that sometime in mid-2012, Seagate formed the intention of removing the Beyonics Group as a baseplate supplier, and by November 2012, appeared to have firmed up its plans.
143    In the first set of presentation slides entitled “CMT Review [on] Baseplate commodity” dated 15 December 2011, it was assessed that due to the impact of the Thailand floods, “Beyonics may be critically affected, recovery may be difficult & requires a longer period”. This reflected Seagate’s anxiety about the Beyonics Group’s ability to continue to supply baseplates.
144    In the “Baseplate Commodity Strategy and Plan” presentation slides dated 2 July 2012, Seagate stated that it intended to start consolidating its baseplate suppliers by the third or fourth quarter of 2013, to maintain a stronger and more dedicated supply chain following the Thailand floods. Mr Billy Chua explained that Seagate had projected that the Beyonics Group would be one of the consolidated suppliers because of its low capacity in only having its “China facility” (BTEC) to produce baseplates, as its Thai facility (BTT) was destroyed in the floods. It also appeared that the NEDEC/KODEC Group was becoming a stronger presence in the market. One of the points in the presentation slides was that there would be “Reduced [supply from Beyonics] 
thro’ Nedec integration
” [emphasis added].
145    In the “Mech CMT Review Baseplate” presentation slides dated 13 September 2012, it was explicitly stated that Seagate intended to “eliminate Beyonics [as a supplier] in [the] near term”. Another prong of Seagate’s plan was to “continue forward plan growth with main [suppliers]: Nidec/NMB/MMI”. Mr Billy Chua explained that Nidec and NMB were considered main suppliers because they also supplied motors in addition to baseplates, and MMI had the largest baseplate capacity support for Seagate.
146    Finally, in the “Baseplate Commodity-Suppliers Consolidation” presentation slides dated 20 November 2012, it was expressly stated that various secondary suppliers, being the Beyonics Group, Altum and JCY, would be eliminated “in consecutive phases”. However, the elimination of the three secondary suppliers “all at once” was not recommended, in case of changes in the demand volume. Crucially, of the three secondary suppliers, the Beyonics Group was identified to be the first to be eliminated in Seagate’s FY 2014, with the next secondary supplier (JCY) to be eliminated in Seagate’s FY 2015. This order was confirmed by Mr Billy Chua in cross-examination.
147    On the reasons for proceeding with the consolidation strategy, Mr Billy Chua explained that its master schedule, which projects volume of HDDs required quarterly, revealed a slowdown in the overall projected volume requirements. Therefore, Seagate had to slow down its plans for baseplate capacity for its suppliers. Indeed, in the slides dated 20 November 2012, there was a projection of weak or minimal growth from Seagate’s FY 2013 to FY 2015.
148    In addition, I note that Seagate appeared to be dissatisfied with the Beyonics Group as a supplier of baseplates. On 27 December 2012, having taken over as CEO of the First Plaintiff, Mr Michael Ng met with Seagate representatives, including Mr HC Toh and Mr Billy Chua. In an email to Mr Shaw summarising the meeting, Mr Michael Ng said that Seagate had highlighted its concerns regarding the Beyonics Group’s reluctance to invest after the Thailand floods. As a result, it did not have the requisite technology to compete effectively. Mr HC Toh was said to have made a direct comparison with the higher level of commitment shown by the NEDEC/KODEC Group. He indicated that “those who have made the investment during the Thai flood will proportionately be getting the higher allocation”.
149    According to another email from Mr Michael Ng dated 8 January 2013, Seagate complained that it had to pay more for baseplates produced by the NEDEC/KODEC Group which used e-coated baseplates supplied by the Beyonics Group. Since the NEDEC/KODEC Group would in the near future be qualified to perform the First Stage Work, Seagate could directly buy finished baseplates manufactured solely by the NEDEC/KODEC Group without adhering to the B–N Alliance and without relying on the Beyonics Group for e-coated baseplates.
150    Overall, I am satisfied that Mr Goh’s breaches caused the Total Loss on the traditional “but for” test of causation. I agree with the First Plaintiff that while there were other factors at play, the key reason for the termination of the Beyonics Group, rather than any other supplier, when the market demand fell was its lack of commitment and support shown to Seagate, in contrast to the higher level of commitment shown by the NEDEC/KODEC Group. Seagate’s impression of the Beyonics Group’s lack of capacity was a clear and direct result of Mr Goh’s actions, in particular his under-representation of existing capacity, and his explicit communication that the Beyonics Group was only willing to make limited investments (see [51]).
151    It should be noted that the first indication that Seagate was worried about the Beyonics Group’s capacity to produce baseplates was in the first set of slides dated 15 December 2011, 
ie
, 
after
 Mr Goh had signalled the Beyonics Group’s lack of commitment to Seagate (in mid-October 2011). In contrast, Mr Goh played an instrumental role in helping to build up the NEDEC/KODEC Group as a viable player in the baseplates market in direct competition to the Beyonics Group, including enhancing its capacity to perform First Stage Work as well (see [77]–[90]). As a result, the NEDEC/KODEC Group was consistently listed as a supplier of baseplates to Seagate, while the Beyonics Group was noted to have lost its technological edge.
152    At the end of the day, I found two factors most telling: first, that Seagate preferred to qualify and increasingly rely on a new supplier (the NEDEC/KODEC Group), when it was clear that Seagate would ordinarily have preferred to rely on existing suppliers (see [50]); and second, that the Beyonics Group was eliminated ahead of two other secondary suppliers. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that “but for” Mr Goh’s breaches, Seagate would not have terminated the Beyonics Group as a supplier in FY 2014. That said, I accept that Seagate would likely have terminated the Beyonics Group as a secondary supplier at some point in time, and return to the relevance of this at [221]–[222] below.
153    In any event, I agree with the First Plaintiff that this case falls within the boundaries of 
Brickenden
 (see [135]) such that the First Plaintiff only bears the burden of proving that the breaches were “in some way connected” to the losses before the evidential burden shifts to Mr Goh. Mr Goh, as director and CEO of the First Plaintiff, is within one of the well-established categories of fiduciary relationships. He committed culpable breaches as his actions were deliberate, dishonest and committed for personal gain while keeping the First Plaintiff in the dark. The obligations he breached are all aspects of the duty of honesty and fidelity which stands at the very core of the fiduciary relationship.
154    From the earlier analysis, the First Plaintiff has discharged its burden of proving that Mr Goh’s breaches of fiduciary duties were at least “in some way connected” to the ultimate termination of the Beyonics Group as a supplier of baseplates in FY 2014, and the Total Loss suffered. The evidential burden accordingly shifts to Mr Goh to demonstrate that even without his breaches, the business with Seagate would still have decreased and the Beyonics Group terminated as a baseplate supplier by FY 2014, 
ie
, that the Total Loss would still have been suffered. I am not satisfied that he has succeeded in discharging this evidential burden. Most fundamentally, Mr Goh has been unable to show proof that Seagate’s decision to terminate the Beyonics Group’s supply of baseplates was untainted by the effects of his misconduct. Seagate’s progressive concretisation of its consolidation strategy as evident in the slides in July, September and November 2012 took place after Mr Goh’s under-commitment in terms of capacity and investments (in mid-October 2011) and the commencement of the B–N Alliance (in January 2012). Seagate’s decision to remove the Beyonics Group as a baseplate supplier in FY 2014 was clearly affected by Mr Goh’s actions.
155    Finally, Mr Goh cannot shift the blame to the new executives of the Beyonics Group. Given that the present case clearly falls within the boundaries of 
Brickenden
, as interpreted by 
Quality Assurance
, the court will not consider the contributory fault of these executives, if any: see [136]. In any event, Mr Goh was the CEO until 9 January 2013, and was involved at the highest level of management of the Beyonics Group from July 2012 to November 2012 when Seagate was working out its consolidation strategy and ultimately eliminated the Beyonics Group.
Finding on the First Plaintiff’s claims for breaches of duties
156    By the above, I find that the First Plaintiff has proved its case against Mr Goh for breaches of fiduciary duties. I deal with the quantification of the losses below from [183] onwards.
The First Plaintiff’s claim in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt by Wyser International
157    I next turn to the claim by the First Plaintiff against Wyser International for dishonest assistance in these breaches. In the Amended Statement of Claim, the First Plaintiff appears to allege such dishonest assistance in relation to breaches of fiduciary duties for all four clusters of acts listed in [21]. However, in the closing submissions, the First Plaintiff confines this cause of action to Wyser International’s role in receiving payments under the Wyser Agreements. I shall restrict my findings on this basis.
158    A claim in dishonest assistance is a type of accessory liability: the defendant must have lent assistance to the commission of some breach of duty by a person in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff. Such assistance must have been given dishonestly, and this dishonesty is assessed on an objective basis: see 
Snell’s Equity
 at paras 30-078 and 30-079. In other words, the defendant must have such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them: 
Swiss Butchery Pte Ltd v Huber Ernst
 
[2010] 3 SLR 813
 (“
Swiss Butchery
”) at [21].
159    In this case, Wyser International was used as Mr Goh’s vehicle to enter into the Wyser Agreements. It received the payments under the Wyser Agreements and actively paid out US$300,000 to Mr Stephen Hwang. As to the 
mens rea
 of dishonesty, it is clear that Mr Goh was objectively dishonest, given his personal interest in receiving the payments in return for doing acts detrimental to the Beyonics Group. His dishonesty is to be attributed to Wyser International, which he owned and controlled. I find that Wyser International is liable for dishonest assistance in Mr Goh’s breach of the fiduciary duty not to make a secret profit. However, Wyser International did not assist with the other acts which cumulatively led to the Diversion Loss and Total Loss. Given my conclusion on Wyser International’s liability in dishonest assistance, I do not consider it necessary to deal with the Plaintiffs’ alternative claim based on “knowing receipt” to seek the same reliefs for the payments.
The First Plaintiff’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy
160    I now turn to the First Plaintiff’s final substantive claim, which is that Mr Goh, Wyser International and the NEDEC/KODEC Group conspired to make payments under the Wyser Agreements, divert Second Stage Work from the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, and ultimately hollow out the Beyonics Group’s baseplate business with Seagate.
161    The elements of the tort of unlawful means conspiracy can be summarised as follows:
(a)     There must be a combination of two or more persons and an agreement between or among them to do certain acts: 
Nagase Singapore v Ching Kai Huat
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 80
 (“
Nagase
”) at [23].
(b)     The conspiracy must be done by “unlawful means”. “Unlawful means” covers both a criminal act as well as an intentional tortious act: 
Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG
 
[2009] 3 SLR(R) 452
 at [120]. It includes a breach of fiduciary duties, as in 
Chew Kong Huat v Ricwil Singapore Pte Ltd
 
[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1167
 (“
Chew Kong Huat
”) at [35].
(c)     The act must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement: 
Nagase
 at [23].
(d)     There must be an intention to injure the plaintiff, but such intention need not be predominant: 
Swiss Butchery
 at [15].
(e)     Damage must be suffered by the plaintiff: 
Nagase
 at [23].
162    In relation to the allegation of conspiracy to divert Second Stage Work away from it, I am of the view that it is made out. First, the email correspondence between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group, as well as the BAP–LND Contract, clearly shows that there was an agreement between the parties to divert e-coated baseplates from the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group for the Second Stage Work to be done by the latter. It was clearly agreed that payments would accrue to Mr Goh through Wyser International. Second, the conspiracy was carried out by unlawful means through Mr Goh’s breach of fiduciary duties. Third, the diversion of e-coated baseplates was carried out in furtherance of the agreement, in the manner detailed in the previous sections. Fourth, although the predominant intention of Mr Goh and Wyser International was to benefit Mr Goh and/or the NEDEC/KODEC Group, on analogy with 
Chew Kong Huat
 at [35], the necessary corollary of the benefit to the NEDEC/KODEC Group was loss to the First Plaintiff, as the e-coated baseplates were directly diverted from the latter to the former. Thus, if Mr Goh and Wyser International intended to benefit the NEDEC/KODEC Group, they must also have intended to injure the First Plaintiff, even if this intention was not predominant. Finally, the First Plaintiff suffered damage in the form of the Diversion Loss.
163    However, in my assessment, the First Plaintiff’s claim of unlawful means conspiracy is not made out in relation to the ultimate termination of the Beyonics Group’s business with Seagate. Although Mr Goh played a substantial role in facilitating the NEDEC/KODEC Group’s business with Seagate (see [77]–[90]), fundamentally, there is insufficient evidence of any obvious agreement between Mr Goh, Wyser International and the NEDEC/KODEC Group to do acts which would hollow out the baseplate business of the Beyonics Group entirely.
164    For completeness, I also dismiss the claim in unlawful means conspiracy in relation to payments under the Wyser Agreements. Fundamentally, the fifth element is not satisfied as there was no damage suffered 
by the First Plaintiff
 as a result of the payments to Mr Goh. In any event, nothing turns on this given that I have already found that Wyser International is liable for dishonestly assisting Mr Goh in his breach of fiduciary duties in relation to the payments under the Wyser Agreements.
The Second Plaintiff’s claims for breaches of duties
Unjustified expenses
165    Having dealt with the First Plaintiff’s claims, I turn to the Second Plaintiff’s claims that Mr Goh breached various fiduciary duties in causing or instructing staff members to make unjustified expense claims for various items amounting to S$126,967.45 and HK$38,400 against the account of the Second Plaintiff. Mr Goh does not dispute the items and the amounts, but contends that the company expenses incurred are completely justified as “general corporate business expenses that have been incurred in the course of Beyonics Group’s usual operations”, either as legitimate company expenses or as legitimate employee benefits, and he acted well within his powers as the CEO of the Beyonics Group.
Wine purchases – S$99,598.80
166    Between June 2006 and December 2012, Mr Goh caused the Second Plaintiff to make wine purchases costing a total of S$101,910. There are no records on how the wine was put to use, save for S$2,311.20 worth of the wine which was consumed at a company event in 2007. As such, the balance of S$99,598.80 remains unaccounted for. In the Amended Defence, it is pleaded that “the wines were given to customers or in exchange for gifts given by the customer and used for internal and external functions for the Beyonics Group’s employees, their business associates and suppliers”. This bare assertion was repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC, without details. Mr Goh also stated that most of the wine purchases were authorised by Mr Tay Peng Huat, the CFO of the Beyonics Group. However, this defence was not pleaded, thus I was less inclined to believe it. Together with the lack of records on the precise purposes for the exorbitant expenditure, I find that the sum of S$99,598.80 was an unjustified expense.
Medical equipment – HK$38,400
167    In May 2012, Mr Goh caused the Second Plaintiff to purchase medical equipment, classified as an impulse massager, from Hong Kong for HK$38,400. In the Amended Defence, it is pleaded that Mr Goh “had purchased the medical equipment from a trade show held in Hong Kong for the purposes of research and development. The medical equipment was bought with the intention of evaluating whether the Beyonics Group would be able to develop and increase its product range and thus appeal to a wider range of customers”. These bare assertions were repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC, again without any supporting evidence. I accept the Second Plaintiff’s evidence that the Beyonics Group did not have its own product range to start with. It was a manufacturer of other entities’ products or components, but did not have any customer that was making massagers. The equipment was thus completely irrelevant to its business. In fact, Mr Goh admitted that the equipment was sometimes in his room, and that he had used it. I find that this equipment was not purchased for company use. This expense was thus unjustified.
Course fees for Mr Goh’s daughter – S$1,464.65
168    Mr Goh charged fees to the Second Plaintiff totalling S$1,464.65 during the period between July and December 2011 for two courses on interpersonal communication skills and financial statements, attended by his daughter. According to the Second Plaintiff, there was no basis for such expenditure. At the time, Mr Goh’s daughter was merely a temporary staff member of the Beyonics Group, and the courses she was sent on did not assist with the work she was doing. In the Amended Defence, it was stated that Mr Goh’s daughter “was sent on short external courses to gain knowledge in the relevant areas of her employment with the Beyonics Group. This was in accordance with the Beyonics Group’s company policy at the time”. These bare assertions were repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC without any supporting evidence.
169    I note that Mr Goh’s daughter only worked for the Beyonics Group on a temporary basis from 5 January to 5 July 2007 and 1 June 2011 to 9 February 2012, and that she was assigned to the General Management and Finance departments. There were also human resource policies in place which provide, quite sensibly, that the Beyonics Group should only be sending personnel to courses directly relevant to their job scopes, and the personnel’s performances must have merited being sponsored for the courses. Given that Mr Goh’s daughter was only a temporary staff member who was employed for relatively short spells, and that there were other, longer-serving officers in these departments, there could not have been any justification to send her for the two courses.
Payments to GAIN, Inc for alternative healthcare – S$8,225
170    From 26 July 2012 to 2 January 2013, petty cash amounting to S$10,329 was withdrawn from the Second Plaintiff’s account by Mr Goh’s secretary on Mr Goh’s instructions. Invoices show that some of the monies withdrawn were paid to GAIN, Inc for treatments by a Japanese practitioner of alternative healthcare, including for procedures such as “electroacupuncture”, which are not conventional medical treatments. Subsequently, S$2,104 was repaid by Mr Goh, leaving a balance of S$8,225.
171    In the Amended Defence, it is pleaded that “[m]edical expenses incurred by the employees of the Beyonics Group (including [Mr Goh]) and [Mr Goh’s] family … are justified companies expense claims. This was in compliance with the Beyonics Group’s company policy at the time”. In another instance of a recurring theme, these were bare assertions which were repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC without any supporting evidence. To the contrary, it is clear from Clauses 2.5 and 2.5.10 of the Human Resources Manual of the Beyonics Group that the Beyonics Group’s policies with regard to medical benefits extended only to conventional medical treatments. At the trial, Mr Goh claimed that he was unaware of such a policy. I do not accept this, and find that the expense – since it was incurred for alternative healthcare treatments – was unjustified.
Sigma lens – S$1,679
172    A Nikon D-800 camera was purchased for S$4,066 on 21 September 2012 and charged to BAP’s account, while a Sigma lens was purchased on 2 November 2012 for $1,679 and charged to the Second Plaintiff’s account. The Second Plaintiff’s position is that such equipment was completely unnecessary for the business of the Beyonics Group and should not have been purchased. Given the nature of the Beyonics Group’s business, that position is only sensible. In response, it is pleaded, in the Amended Defence, that “the Sigma lens and camera were used for the purposes of conducting organization and method study on the Beyonics Group’s manufacturing processes and work [behaviour] … Further, the Sigma lens and camera were used for corporate marketing purposes. Instead of professional photographers, the Beyonics Group used self-taken photos for the purposes of their corporate brochures, presentation slides, web marketing and exhibition stands”. These bare assertions were repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC. I find it difficult to believe these explanations. There is no evidence that the alleged studies were carried out or that any such photographs were ever taken. As such, purchasing the lens is in my view a completely unjustified expense.
Fountain pens – S$16,000
173    On or around 7 December 2011, ten fountain pens worth S$1,600 each were purchased on the Mr Goh’s instructions. A total of S$16,000 for these fountain pens was charged to the Second Plaintiff, but there are no records of the purpose of the fountain pens. In the Amended Defence, it is stated that five of the ten fountain pens were purchased as long service awards for senior employees of the Beyonics Group, while the remaining five were given to “the previous Directors of the Board of the [First] Plaintiff when it was dissolved”.
174    Again, these bare assertions were repeated in Mr Goh’s AEIC, without identifying the relevant senior employees and directors. Mr Goh only named them at the trial. However, his claims were contradicted by the evidence of Mr Mueller, who testified that according to the Beyonics Group’s records, long service award recipients in the year 2011 and 2012 only received cash vouchers and commemorative coins. Mr Goh did not dispute this evidence. In relation to the five fountain pens allegedly given to the previous Board of Directors of the First Plaintiff when the Board was dissolved, it was only when cross-examined at trial that Mr Goh admitted that he was one of the five recipients. There was no reason for Mr Goh to gift himself with an expensive pen while he remained with the company. In my view, it is clear that there was no proper justification for the purchases.
Findings on unjustified expenses
175    To conclude, a review of the evidence and proceedings at trial shows that Mr Goh’s predominant lines of defence were bare assertions not supported by evidence, supplemented by allegations that the Plaintiffs were being “petty” and subjecting him to “personal attacks”. Some of his defences were also only asserted on the stand and were neither pleaded nor present in his AEIC. I am of the view that these expenses charged by Mr Goh to the Second Plaintiff’s accounts were unjustified. They were not incurred for the benefit of the company. Instead, they were incurred for his personal benefit and/or that of his family members. This was a clear breach of his fiduciary duties.
Unjustified salary
176    It is undisputed that the Second Plaintiff initially agreed that Mr Goh was to continue receiving a monthly salary from 10 January to 30 April 2013, after his resignation on 9 January 2013. It is also undisputed that a total of S$45,900 in salary was in fact paid out to Mr Goh between 10 January and 31 March 2013. The Second Plaintiff’s case is that Mr Goh is not entitled to these payments due to his failure to disclose the various breaches of duties to the Second Plaintiff. The Second Plaintiff therefore sought to recover the unjustified salary of S$45,900 paid to Mr Goh during the relevant period. Mr Goh contends that the Second Plaintiff is not entitled to the return of the S$45,900 because he did not breach any of his duties. He further counterclaims $17,000 as the “outstanding salary” for April 2013.
177    Given my conclusions that Mr Goh has breached his fiduciary duties as outlined above, including the duty to disclose his wrongdoing, I find that the salary paid to Mr Goh was unjustified and should be repaid to the Second Plaintiff: see 
John While Springs
 at [7]. I agree with the Plaintiffs’ submission that although 
John While Springs
 related to the payment of bonuses, the same principle ought to apply to salaries paid after resignation. No reasonable employer would agree to continue to pay the fiduciary salary when faced with knowledge of the fiduciary’s breach of duties and lack of good faith. Consequently, I dismiss Mr Goh’s counterclaim for “outstanding salary”.
Defence under s 391 of the Companies Act
178    At this juncture, I turn briefly to Mr Goh’s overall defence under s 391 of the Companies Act, which states:
 
Power to grant relief
 
391(1) – If in any proceedings for negligence, default, 
breach of duty
 or breach of trust against a person to whom this section applies it appears to the court before which the proceedings are taken that he is or may be liable in respect thereof 
but that he has acted honestly and reasonably
 and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including those connected with his appointment, 
he ought fairly to be excused
 for the negligence, default or breach 
the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from his liability on such terms as the court thinks fit
.
(1A) For the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), “liability” includes the liability of a person to whom this section applies to account for profits made or received.
[emphasis added]
179    Relief under s 391 is only available where a defendant “has acted honestly and reasonably”. As stated above, I find that Mr Goh has breached the core duty to act honestly and 
bona fide
 in the interests of the Plaintiffs, among other duties. Therefore, he cannot avail himself of the defence under s 391. In any event, relief under s 391 is at the court’s discretion, as indicated by the words “may relieve him … on such terms as the court thinks fit”. In the circumstances, even if relief under s 391 were available, I see no reason to excuse him for the breaches so as to relieve him wholly or partly from his liability.
Credibility of the witnesses
180    To close my analysis of the liability issues, I make some observations about the credibility of the key witnesses. First, from the analysis above, it is clear that Mr Goh’s evidence has been inconsistent, with him shifting stances on various matters, many of which were not even pleaded. In addition, I find that he was generally reluctant to divulge the details of the dealings with the NEDEC/KODEC Group and was evasive in cross-examination. At times, he also provided answers which were implausible. He further attempted to explain away the incriminating contents of some of the recovered emails by shifting the blame to Mr Stephen Hwang and Mr Tony Lee for the way they expressed themselves. On various aspects, the evidence of Mr Tony Lee and Mr Billy Chua directly contradicted him. On the whole, I find Mr Goh to be an unreliable witness and am unable to accept his evidence.
181    As for Mr Lee Leong Hua, the Defendants have submitted at length about the unreliability of his evidence on the production capacity at BTEC. They argue that he “came to trial as a witness simply because he was instructed by the Plaintiffs’ management to support their case theory that there was ‘something suspicious’ about the tie-up between the Beyonics Group and the NEDEC/KODEC Group”. I am unable to agree. In my judgment, Mr Lee Leong Hua’s evidence regarding production capacity was supported by the objective documentary evidence. He was also able to give logical explanations on the discrepancies in numbers between the various source documents relating to production capacity. I thus accept his evidence.
182    Moving on to Mr Billy Chua, I am of the view that he is an independent witness who was unaware of the dealings between Mr Goh and the NEDEC/KODEC Group. I find his testimony truthful. As for Mr Tony Lee, I am also satisfied that he is a credible witness at least in the aspects of the case that do not implicate him or the NEDEC/KODEC Group, and I accept those parts of his evidence accordingly.
Remedies
183    With that, I turn to consider the remedies sought by the First Plaintiff to recover the payments under the Wyser Agreements, the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss. Thereafter, I will turn to the remedies sought by the Second Plaintiff for the unjustified expenses and salary.
Account of and repayments under the Wyser Agreements
184    It is well-established that a fiduciary who takes secret bribes in breach of his fiduciary duties is not allowed to retain any of the profits and must account for them to the principal and disgorge the profits: 
Snell’s Equity
 at para 7-054 and 
Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan
 
[2014] 1 SLR 847
 at [15]. The net quantum of US$200,000 received by Mr Goh under the Second Wyser Agreement is undisputed, and Wyser International dishonestly assisted in this process. Mr Goh and/or Wyser International are to account for and pay the First Plaintiff US$200,000.
185    The key contention relates to the quantification of the payments received under the First Wyser Agreement. The First Plaintiff alleges that a total of US$166,554.02 was received by Mr Goh through Wyser International. This figure is calculated as follows. Based on the sales figures extracted from the Oracle record system, 8,327,701 e-coated baseplates were shipped from the Beyonics Group to the NEDEC/KODEC Group from January 2012 to January 2013. This figure takes into account the baseplates returned or rejected by the NEDEC/KODEC Group. The amount received by Mr Goh would be 8,327,701 multiplied by US$0.02 per e-coated baseplate as agreed under the First Wyser Agreement, which is US$166,554.02.
186    The number of diverted e-coated baseplates was originally disputed by Mr Goh, who put forth a lower figure of 8,075,653. However, in the course of the trial, Mr Goh accepted the figure of 8,327,701 as accurate. The disagreement turned to the sum he actually received for these diverted baseplates. In his AEIC, Mr Goh alleges that payment under the First Wyser Agreement was “based on the shipping quantity [of e-coated baseplates] shipped from [BTEC] to [LND] and subject to [the] supplied baseplate not being rejected for unsatisfactory quality”. He claimed that he had only received US$88,411.59 due to the rejection of baseplates. However, to accept this position would entail accepting that half of the e-coated baseplates supplied to the NEDEC/KODEC Group were rejected, which is plainly inconceivable.
187    At trial, Mr Goh’s explanation took on a different slant. He alleged that the NEDEC/KODEC Group would only pay Mr Goh based on the e-coated baseplates shipped from KODEC to NCC (the entity which received the baseplates and assembled them into HDDs on behalf of Seagate), and not from BTEC to LND. Payment would also only take place after NCC had paid KODEC. The NEDEC/KODEC Group had only paid Mr Goh about US$88,000 because up to January 2013, NCC had only paid the NEDEC/KODEC Group for about 4.4 million e-coated baseplates. NCC paid the NEDEC/KODEC Group for the balance of about 3.9 million baseplates after January 2013. By then, the Beyonics Group had stopped shipping the e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, and Mr Tony Lee decided to stop paying Mr Goh.
188    Mr Goh’s explanation at the trial as to why he only received about US$88,411.59 was contrary to what was stated in his AEIC, and inconsistent with the wording of the First Wyser Agreement that the payment would be based on the quantity accepted by LND (rather than NCC). It appears to be a mere afterthought. Given that Mr Goh accepted the figure of 8,327,701 as accurate, I find that payment of US$166,554.02 is to be made by Mr Goh and/or Wyser International to the First Plaintiff.
Quantification of the Diversion Loss and Total Loss
189    Mr Goh’s breaches of fiduciary duties allow the First Plaintiff to avail itself to a claim for payment of equitable compensation for losses (in this case the Diversion Loss and Total Loss) caused by the breaches: see 
Snell’s Equity
 at para 7-058. The parties, however, disagree on the quantification of the losses. Thus, I now turn to the evidence of the accounting experts, who are Mr Ramasamy Subramaniam Iyer @ Rajendran (“Mr Iyer”) for the Plaintiffs and Mr Kon Ying Tong (“Mr Kon”) for the Defendants.
190    I make two preliminary comments about the overall approaches of the experts. First, Mr Iyer opined only on the quantum of the Diversion Loss and Total Loss. He acknowledged in his amended report that “as the financial expert, it [was] not [his] duty to discuss the liability aspects of the case”. In contrast, Mr Kon, pursuant to instructions received, dedicated a large part of his report to his opinion on liability issues. In particular, he opined on whether the Beyonics Group had the capacity to do the Second Stage Work on the e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group and, if not, whether it was worthwhile for the Beyonics Group to make capital investments to do so.
191    I note that in the exchange of correspondence between the parties’ counsel prior to the trial, it was clear that the scope of the accounting experts’ evidence would be limited to the quantum of loss. Accordingly, on 6 July 2015, the Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Objection to Contents of AEIC in respect of the parts of Mr Kon’s report relating to liability. I am of the view that Mr Kon ventured into areas which are outside the remit of an accounting expert, and which fall to be determined by the court based on the evidence of the other factual witnesses. In fact, without reference to Mr Kon’s evidence, I have already made most of the necessary findings above.
192    Second, I turn to the source materials relied on to compute the losses. In his amended report, Mr Iyer recognised that he was calculating the losses as suffered by the First Plaintiff on a consolidated basis as the holding company of the subsidiaries within the PE Division. To obtain the necessary financial information, he relied on a range of records of the Beyonics Group which I shall refer to as “the accounting documents”:
(a)     The consolidated financial statements of the First Plaintiff for FY 2011, FY 2012 and FY 2013, as audited and signed off on.
(b)     Information from the Beyonics Group’s Oracle record system.
(c)     Dashboard reports for FY 2012 and FY 2013, which are the unaudited management financial statements prepared each month covering (i) the profit and loss statement by operating companies; (ii) the balance sheet for each operating company; and (iii) sales by major customers, volume of shipment by major products for the major customers and derived average selling price information.
193    On the other hand, Mr Kon relied on specific documents and instructions provided by Mr Goh. In particular, he uncritically relied on two emails sent by Ms June Yang, the finance director of BTEC, setting out the cost figures for producing each baseplate under the Brinks 2H programme. At the trial, the contents from the two emails of 29 June 2012 and 3 December 2012 were collated and presented as Exh P19. For ease of reference, I have reproduced the essential information from Exh P19 at Annex A below. I will elaborate on my concerns about relying on the information in the two emails shortly. For now, my observation is that Mr Iyer relied on a more comprehensive range of source materials. I now turn to the Diversion Loss.
The Diversion Loss
Mr Iyer’s evidence 
194    Mr Iyer identified the Diversion Loss to be the loss of earnings on the units shipped to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, represented by the difference that the First Plaintiff would have otherwise earned had the Beyonics Group carried out the Second Stage Work less the payment it received from the NEDEC/KODEC Group for the First Stage Work. To calculate this, Mr Iyer took the following steps:
(a)     From the Oracle record system, the monthly numbers of e-coated baseplates shipped to the NEDEC/KODEC Group were obtained.
(b)     The price differential between the price of a finished baseplate and the price of an e-coated baseplate was computed. This represented what the Beyonics Group would have earned if it supplied a finished baseplate to Seagate, less the payment it received from the NEDEC/KODEC Group for the e-coated baseplates diverted to it.
(c)     The monthly numbers of e-coated baseplates derived at step (a) were multiplied by the price differential derived at step (b) to obtain the loss of revenue on Second Stage Work.
(d)     An adjusted gross profit margin (“Adjusted GP Margin”) was applied to the loss of revenue on Second Stage Work derived at step (c) to obtain the loss of marginal cash flow. I shall return to Mr Iyer’s computation of the Adjusted GP Margin shortly at [195].
(e)     The monthly cost adder that would have been earned (if finished baseplates had been shipped to Seagate) was obtained by multiplying the cost adder per baseplate by the number of e-coated baseplates shipped to the NEDEC/KODEC Group for that month.
(f)     From the loss of marginal cash flow obtained at step (d), adjustments were made to take into account baseplates which were returned, as well as for the monthly cost adder derived at step (e) to obtain the net loss of marginal cash flow.
(g)     As the net loss of marginal cash flow was calculated separately for BTEC and BPM which both supplied the e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group at the material time, the losses for BTEC and BPM were then added to obtain the aggregate loss for the PE Division of the Beyonics Group.
(h)     Finally, RMB 504,672 was deducted from the aggregate loss. This represented the capital expenditure that would have been required to ensure that the Beyonics Group had sufficient capacity to undertake all required Second Stage Work. The capital expenditure figure was obtained from para 94 of Mr Lee Leong Hua’s AEIC, where he stated that a capital expenditure of RMB 504,672 was required to purchase the necessary tools, fixtures and cutters.
The net aggregated loss after deducting the capital expenditure from the aggregate loss, 
ie
, the Diversion Loss, was computed to be US$2,970,559. Mr Iyer’s calculations are contained in Appendix 7A of his amended report.
195    I turn next to the Adjusted GP Margin which was applied to the loss of revenue at [194(d)]. In ordinary cases, the gross profit (“GP”) is simply the sales revenue less the total costs (including the costs of materials, labour and manufacturing overheads), and the gross profit margin (“GP Margin”) is the GP divided by the sales revenue. In this case, Mr Iyer retrieved financial data from the dashboard reports to obtain the cost adders on different products which applied from December 2011 to December 2012 (see [122]). The various cost adders were tabulated to obtain the monthly total cost adders. The monthly cost adders were removed from the monthly sales revenue of BTEC and BPM respectively to obtain the revised sales revenues. The revised GP, which was the revised sales revenue less the total costs, was obtained. Thereafter, the Adjusted GP Margin was obtained by dividing the revised GP by the revised sales revenue. As explained by Mr Iyer, it was necessary to use the Adjusted GP Margin to prevent double counting because the cost adders for these particular months were then separately computed for the quantities of e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, and were added back in computing the Diversion Loss: see [194(f)].
196    In the main, the Defendants sought to cast doubt on Mr Iyer’s computation of the Adjusted GP Margin. First, it was alleged that Mr Iyer used an overall margin, rather than one that is specific to the Brinks 2H programme. This is because Mr Iyer took into account information relating to all the baseplate programmes undertaken by the Beyonics Group (not just Brinks 2H baseplates) in computing the Adjusted GP Margin. Instead, it was suggested to Mr Iyer that he could have taken into account the costs stated in Ms June Yang’s emails, which dealt specifically with costs for the Brinks 2H programme.
197    Mr Iyer highlighted that it was not clear how Ms June Yang came up with the numbers reflected in the emails. He did not think that the emails were reliable. Therefore, he preferred to rely on the “actual numbers in the management accounts”, because they were “very clear[,] … contemporaneous [and] … in the books and records”, which had been audited and signed off on, cross checked against the dashboard reports. However, Mr Iyer explained that the accounting documents were not captured at a level of detail to enable a computation specific to the baseplates for the Brinks 2H programme. He had to rely on the best available information and use the average for BTEC and BPM. I accept Mr Iyer’s explanations. For the reasons I set out at [207] below, the figures in Ms June Yang’s emails cannot form the basis of any credible computation. Given the insufficiency of information specifically on the Brinks 2H programme from the accounting documents, Mr Iyer’s approach is reasonable.
198    Second, Mr Kon challenged Mr Iyer’s computations on the basis that his calculation of margins excluded costs such as for packing and shipping. These are items set out in Ms June Yang’s emails. I am of the view that this criticism is misconceived. Mr Iyer’s computation of costs is derived from the dashboard reports, which I accept already take into account all costs to generate profits. This would necessarily include packing, shipping and any other costs incurred. This is not an effective rebuttal of Mr Iyer’s position.
199    Third, it is argued that Mr Iyer should have taken into account depreciation in computing the Adjusted GP Margin. In this regard, Mr Kon said that depreciation should have been factored in not just in respect of new machines that had to be acquired but even existing machines which could be put to alternative use. It was also put to Mr Iyer that depreciation for machines already purchased formed part of the incremental cost of sales, and therefore should be included for an accurate computation of Adjusted GP Margin. However, I agree with Mr Iyer’s explanations at trial for his exclusion of depreciation in his computation of the Adjusted GP Margin:
(a)     He was applying the concept of marginal cash flow, but depreciation was part of the costs of machines which were sunk costs. Since the machines were already paid for, there was no incremental cost of sale in producing more or fewer baseplates.
(b)     Equipment is more often than not used for much longer periods than the years applied under a company’s depreciation policy.
(c)     Based on the concept of marginal return, the additional cash from selling an additional baseplate is the selling price of the baseplate less the cost of producing that baseplate. The depreciation, however, remained constant regardless of the number of baseplates sold.
200    Despite the criticisms levied regarding Mr Iyer’s computation of the Adjusted GP Margin, Mr Kon agreed that broadly speaking, Mr Iyer’s approach, 
ie
, sales revenue minus cost of sales, was one way to determine profit margin, and that it was right and proper for Mr Iyer to remove the effect of the cost adder in revising the GP Margin. Mr Kon also agreed that Mr Iyer’s approach to computing the Diversion Loss was generally correct. In my view, Mr Iyer’s method is objective, systematic and logical. His reliance on the accounting documents as his source of data enhances the objectivity and reliability of his computation.
Mr Kon’s evidence
201    In computing the Diversion Loss, Mr Kon took the following steps in his report. At the outset, he considered whether the Beyonics Group had the capacity to do the Second Stage Work which was diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group, and concluded that it did not. He then considered whether it was worthwhile for the Beyonics Group to make capital investments in order to perform the Second Stage Work.
202    Next, Mr Kon calculated the total profit generated for the Beyonics Group through selling e-coated baseplates to the NEDEC/KODEC Group (“First Stage Profit”). The following steps were taken:
(a)     The gross margin for each e-coated baseplate was computed by deducting the cost of performing the First Stage Work from the price of each e-coated baseplate sold to the NEDEC/KODEC Group. The cost of performing the First Stage Work was taken to be US$1.14, a figure obtained from Ms June Yang’s email of 3 December 2012: see Annex A below.
(b)     The quantities of e-coated baseplates shipped to the NEDEC/KODEC Group were multiplied by the gross margin for each e-coated baseplate to obtain the First Stage Profit. This was computed to be between US$522,805 and US$727,285.
203    Thereafter, Mr Kon calculated the total profit that would have been earned if the Beyonics Group had carried out the Second Stage Work itself and sold the finished baseplates to Seagate (“Second Stage Profit”):
(a)     The gross margin for a finished baseplate was calculated by deducting the cost of performing both the First and Second Stage Works on a baseplate from the selling price of a finished baseplate sold to Seagate (with the cost adder). The cost of performing both stages of works, based on the figures provided in Ms June Yang’s email of 29 June 2012, was US$1.626: see Annex A below.
(b)     The quantities of the e-coated baseplates shipped to the NEDEC/KODEC Group were multiplied by the gross margin for a finished baseplate to obtain the Second Stage Profit. This was computed to be US$936,965 to US$1,301,622.
204    Based on the above, Mr Kon calculated the difference between the Second Stage Profit and the First Stage Profit to derive the range of forgone profits as US$414,160 to US$574,337. Then, he expressed the opinion that in any case, the Beyonics Group had saved on the additional US$10 million required to invest in CNC machines and US$4.45 million required to acquire related equipment in order to carry out the Second Stage Work on its own.
205    While I do not disagree with Mr Kon’s methodology in principle, there are two fundamental flaws with his report. The first is that, as mentioned at [191], the question of whether the Beyonics Group had capacity to do the Second Stage Work diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group is a factual one which was not, in my assessment, within Mr Kon’s remit as an expert. Under cross-examination, Mr Kon admitted as much, saying that he was “not an expert on capacity and perhaps engineers and management would be the best person to do that [
ie
, to comment on issues of production capacity]”. He also agreed that his conclusion on this issue was premised upon emails and information provided to him by Mr Goh, especially the AEICs of the Defendants’ witnesses. In any case, I have already found earlier that the Beyonics Group had sufficient production capacity (particularly with respect to the CNC machines) and therefore place little weight on this portion of Mr Kon’s report.
206    As for the issue of whether it was worthwhile for the Beyonics Group to make capital investments in order to perform the Second Stage Work, this is similarly outside the purview of an accounting expert. Indeed, Mr Kon agreed that it would be more appropriate for a factual witness to comment on this issue. On this, Mr Lee Leong Hua’s evidence is that only a small investment for tools and fixtures is required to equip the Beyonics Group to perform the Second Stage Work on the e-coated baseplates diverted to the NEDEC/KODEC Group: see [107]. As I stated at [119], the Beyonics Group had obtained a grant from Seagate which would have gone a long way to meeting the investment requirements. I accepted Mr Lee Leong Hua’s computation of the capital investment the Beyonics Group required, which was used by Mr Iyer in his calculations at [194(h)].
207    The second issue with Mr Kon’s report was his sole reliance on the two emails from Ms June Yang for the costs of the First and/or Second Stage Works. This data was untested, unverified and unreliable. Mr Kon himself admitted that he did not know how the figures in Ms June Yang’s emails were derived. Mr Kon also agreed that the figures in the two emails were different in respect of the same line items. At the end of the day, there was no indication of the parameters which were used by Ms June Yang and whether the same parameters were applied for both emails. In my view, the accounting documents Mr Iyer used in his amended report were more reliable than Ms June Yang’s emails. Even after being served with Mr Iyer’s original report on 30 June 2015, the Defendants took no steps to have Mr Kon consider the accounting documents. Mr Kon did not comment on them, or seek to derive any alternative computation based on them for comparison purposes. I should add that the original report was substantially the same as the amended report which served to correct certain figures and calculations.
Findings on the Diversion Loss
208    In light of the above, I prefer Mr Iyer’s computation of the Diversion Loss to Mr Kon’s computation. Mr Iyer’s amended report is detailed, considered, and based on hard financial data found in the books and records of the Beyonics Group. In contrast, Mr Kon’s reliance on the emails is misplaced. In these circumstances, Mr Iyer’s computation of the Diversion Loss at US$2,970,559 is adopted. I should point out that conceptually, the remedy that is available to the First Plaintiff against Mr Goh and Wyser International in relation to the Diversion Loss under the claim for unlawful means conspiracy is damages, not equitable compensation, as the claim is in tort and not in equity. However, the quantum of the damages is the same as the Diversion Loss quantified above.
The Total Loss
209    In relation to the computation of the Total Loss, Mr Iyer and Mr Kon adopted a similar approach by considering the length of time over which the loss should be assessed (“the relevant period”), before quantifying the loss during the relevant period. I shall deal with each in turn.
The relevant period
Mr Iyer’s evidence
210    Mr Iyer reviewed articles about the industry and concluded that new customers were difficult to acquire and that customers also tended to stay with a manufacturer for a long time. He noted that Seagate had been a long-time customer of the Beyonics Group since 1987. On the basis of information available to him, Mr Iyer opined that the loss period should be five years from the base year, FY 2012. I accept that Mr Iyer’s approach is generally sound.
Mr Kon’s evidence
211    The portion of Mr Kon’s report relating to the Total Loss spans only three pages. He refers to an email dated 8 January 2013 from Mr Michael Ng to Mr Lee Leong Hua, which stated that Seagate had informed the Beyonics Group that the latter would not be one of Seagate’s suppliers after March 2013. On the basis of this email, Mr Kon concludes that if there is any loss of profit for the post-breach period, it should be limited to the first three months of 2013.
212    In my view, this is misconceived. Based on the sales figures from the Oracle record system, there were sales by BTEC to Seagate at least up to July 2013. Mr Kon admitted that the cut-off date of 31 March 2013 was based on the Defendants’ instructions, and he has not considered whether this accurately reflects the eventual date of termination. Even assuming that the termination occurred in March 2013, to use this as the end date is arbitrary. Mr Kon has assumed without substantiation that the effects of the breach by Mr Goh came to an end immediately upon termination. There is no real basis to support the position that the loss computation should be limited to the three-month period of January to March 2013.
213    Alternatively, Mr Kon suggested a using a time-frame of six months, based on 
MFM Restaurant Pte Ltd v Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd
 
[2011] 1 SLR 150
 (“
MFM v Fish & Co
”). He concluded in his report that the post-breach period should be 12 months, the effect of the breach would taper off over the 12 months, and an average of six months may be used to calculate the loss of profits for the post-breach period.
214    However, I agree with the Plaintiffs that 
MFM v Fish & Co
 can be distinguished. In that case, the plaintiff ran a chain of seafood restaurants. The second defendant helped set up another chain of seafood restaurants for the first defendant. The plaintiff brought proceedings against the second defendant for breaching certain confidentiality and non-competition clauses in his employment contract. However, the action was settled. Under the settlement deed, the defendants undertook not to use certain pans, slogans, or sauces similar or identical to those used by the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently sued on the settlement deed, alleging that the defendants’ breaches of the settlement deed resulted in confusion in the market, thus affecting its sales. In respect of the plaintiff’s claim for damages for the post-breach period, the Court held that the relevant period of assessment was six months. 12 months was thought to be a reasonable duration given that consumers would take some time to become aware of the changes, but the damages were halved because there would be a gradual decrease in the effect of the defendants’ breaches.
215    The facts of 
MFM v Fish & Co
 are markedly different from the present case, where the effect of the breaches would not decrease with time. The basis of the loss here was not that the breaches led to confusion among customers. Seagate was aware that it was terminating the Beyonics Group as a supplier, and that the NEDEC/KODEC Group was a competitor of the Beyonics Group. The passage of time alone would not cause the lost sales to gradually restore themselves. I am of the view that Mr Kon’s alternative approach is also misguided.
The quantum of loss
Mr Iyer’s evidence
216    To calculate the Total Loss, Mr Iyer did the following:
(a)     First, he considered the number of units sold to Seagate in FY 2012, FY 2013 and FY 2014. He noted that the sales quantity decreased from FY 2012 to FY 2013, and decreased further to almost nothing by FY 2014. By FY 2015, there were no more baseplate sales to Seagate. Therefore, he used FY 2012 as the base year to peg the maximum quantity for which the loss for subsequent years would be computed. He assumed that there would have been no growth in the Beyonics Group’s baseplate business with Seagate from FY 2012.
(b)     To obtain the loss in quantity of baseplate sold in FY 2013 and FY 2014, he computed the difference between the quantities sold in FY 2012 and those in FY 2013 and FY 2014 respectively. For FY 2015 to FY 2017, he used the entire quantity of FY 2012 to represent the loss in quantities, given that there were no more baseplate sales by then.
(c)     The loss in quantity for each FY was multiplied by the average selling price of baseplates to Seagate for that FY to obtain the loss in sales revenue from Seagate for that FY. I shall return to the calculation of the average selling price for each FY shortly at [217].
(d)     The loss in sales revenue from Seagate for each FY was then multiplied by either an Adjusted GP Margin or an average Adjusted GP Margin to obtain the loss of marginal cash flow. I shall return to the calculation of these margins shortly at [217].
Adding up the net present values of the losses for the five years from FY 2013 to FY 2017, Mr Iyer computed the Seagate Total Loss to be US$10,067,868. Mr Iyer’s calculations are contained in Appendix 11A of his amended report.
217    Turning to the average selling price, Mr Iyer explained that he obtained the sales revenue for Seagate from the dashboard reports for FY 2012 and FY 2013, the most proximate years to Mr Goh’s breaches, and deducted the cost adders from the sales revenue to obtain the revised sales revenue. Then, he divided the figures against the quantities supplied to Seagate to obtain the actual average selling prices for FY 2012 and FY 2013. For FY 2014 to FY 2017, he applied the average of the actual average selling prices for FY 2012 and 2013. Turning to the Adjusted GP Margin, in a process similar to that for the calculation at [195], he calculated the figures for the PE Division for FY 2012 as 7.5% and FY 2013 as 8.6%. For FY 2014 to FY 2017, he then used the average of the two figures of 8% as the average Adjusted GP Margin.
218    Mr Goh sought to cast doubt on the reliability of Mr Iyer’s approach by asserting that FY 2012 was an “exceptional” year due to the floods in Thailand. He claims it should not have been used as the base year, as it is not representative of the average profits for the PE Division. However, based on the figures which were reviewed by both parties, it is evident that the volume of baseplates supplied to Seagate tended to fluctuate over the years. Relying on FY 2012 figures was conservative, as higher volumes had been supplied in other years. To illustrate, a significantly larger number of baseplates were shipped from the Beyonics Group to Seagate in FY 2011 compared to FY 2012: 25,641,783 versus 15,672,552. If FY 2011 were to be used as a base year, an even higher quantity of sales would be used as the base number to compute loss.
219    It was suggested to Mr Iyer that the PE Division was a loss-making business from FY 2011. However, as Mr Iyer explained, the basis of his computation of loss was the net cash generated by the PE Division. Although the historical sunk costs on fixed assets remain, the more the fixed assets are used, the higher the cash generated, which then improves the returns. I accept this explanation.
Mr Kon’s evidence
220    Turning to the quantum of loss, Mr Kon opined in his report that because the cost adder was removed after December 2012, the Beyonics Group in fact suffered a loss for each finished Brinks 2H baseplate sold to Seagate. This assertion was based on Ms June Yang’s email dated 29 June 2012, which suggests that BTEC would suffer a loss of US$0.19 per finished baseplate: see Annex A below. Therefore, Mr Kon concluded that there is no loss of profit for the post-breach period at all. Again, in my assessment, Mr Kon has placed undue reliance on a single email without taking into account its context and any other contradictory information, and without knowing the background as to how the figures therein were derived. For the reasons set out above, Mr Kon’s reliance on the costing figures in Ms June Yang’s email is flawed.
Findings on the Total Loss
221    In my assessment, Mr Iyer’s overall methodology should be preferred to Mr Kon’s. However, turning to the relevant period, it appears to me that five years is not justifiable. There were a number of factors, as set out in [145]–[147], which indicate that the Beyonics Group would likely have been terminated sooner or later, and which are significant in determining the relevant period. Although it is undisputed that the Beyonics Group had been producing baseplates for Seagate since 1987, there were clearly other competitors in the market and other suppliers to Seagate which could replace the Beyonics Group. It is also evident from the events from 2011 to 2013 that market conditions can change dramatically, affecting Seagate’s strategy in relation to the suppliers. In October 2011, the reduced supply caused by the floods in Thailand led Seagate to consider alternatives to increase its supply. However, the projected fall in demand of HDDs in 2013 led Seagate to consider the consolidation of its secondary suppliers. Seagate then formed the view that it would be more efficient to rely more heavily on its primary suppliers, which either also manufactured motors for HDDs or had large production capacity. The Beyonics Group would not have been able to break into this category of suppliers even without Mr Goh’s breaches of duty.
222    Thus, while I have found that Mr Goh’s breaches caused Seagate to eliminate the Beyonics Group 
first
 out of the three secondary suppliers, I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities, based on the other factors stated above, that the Beyonics Group would have been terminated as a secondary supplier in due course. With these factors in mind, a period of five years is not supportable. The more difficult question is what, then, the appropriate period would be. It is impossible to state with certainty and precision at which point the Beyonics Group would have been terminated without Mr Goh’s breaches. It should be noted that the 
Brickenden
 rule cannot resolve this uncertainty. Its ambit is the causation of loss (
ie
, whether Mr Goh’s breaches had led to the decrease in sales and termination of business with Seagate in FY 2014). It does not extend to matters relating to the quantification of loss once causation is proven (
ie
, what the relevant period of loss would be). Ultimately, it still falls to the court to decide, on all the evidence, what the relevant period would be. Giving due weight to the factors discussed above, it appears to me that 
two and a half years
 from the base year of FY 2012 (
ie
, FY 2013, FY 2014 and half of FY 2015) is a reasonable period. As the last shipment of baseplates to Seagate was in August 2013 (see [19]), the first month of FY 2014, the Beyonics Group is compensated for the decrease in sales and the complete loss of business until about one and a half years after its termination. This would be sometime in the midst of Seagate’s consolidation exercise.
223    For the quantum of the losses, I accept Mr Iyer’s computation at US$1,184,178 for FY 2013, US$2,404,979 for FY 2014 and US$1,204,434 for half of FY 2015 (
ie
, half of US$2,408,867). The Total Loss is US$4,793,591.
Quantification of unjustified expenses and salary
224    I have already found that all the claims for unjustified expenses and salary have been established. The sums payable would be S$126,967.45 and HK$38,400 for the unjustified expenses and S$45,900 for unjustified salary.
Conclusion
225    In conclusion, I find that the First Plaintiff’s claims against Mr Goh for breaches of fiduciary duties, against Mr Goh and Wyser International for unlawful means conspiracy in relation to the Diversion Loss, and against Wyser International for dishonest assistance with respect to payments under the Wyser Agreements have been made out. Accordingly, I grant judgment to the First Plaintiff against Mr Goh and Wyser International jointly and severally for
(a)     US$166,554.02 paid under the First Wyser Agreement;
(b)     US$200,000 paid under the Second Wyser Agreement; and
(c)     US$2,970,559 for the Diversion Loss.
In addition, I grant judgment to the First Plaintiff against Mr Goh for the Total Loss quantified at US$4,793,591.
226    I also find that the Second Plaintiff’s claims against Mr Goh for unjustified expenses and salary are made out. Accordingly, I grant judgment to the Second Plaintiff against Mr Goh for the sum of S$126,967.45 and HK$38,400 as unjustified expenses and S$45,900 as unjustified salary.
227    The counterclaim is dismissed.
228    I will hear the parties on costs.

Summary rejection of appeal

Introduction
1       The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of consuming monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug, under s 8(
b
)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) in the District Court. In the charge, it was stated that he had one previous admission and one previous conviction for consumption of specified drugs, and would therefore face a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the current offence under the enhanced punishment regime set out in s 33A(1) of the MDA.
[note: 1]
 Such a charge is commonly referred to as a “Long Term Imprisonment 1” or “LT1” charge for short and I will use this acronym to refer both to charges of this form as well as to the regime of enhanced punishments set out under s 33A(1) of the MDA more generally. The appellant was represented by his present counsel, Mr S K Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), who confirmed that the appellant understood the nature and consequences of his plea and the punishment prescribed for the offence
[note: 2]
. The appellant was convicted and the mandatory minimum sentence was duly imposed. Dissatisfied, the appellant filed an appeal against his sentence on the ground that he did not qualify for enhanced punishment. The appeal was set down to be heard in January 2016.
2       Three weeks before the appeal was scheduled to be heard, the Prosecution wrote to invite the court to exercise its power under s 384(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (I will refer to the provision simply as “s 384(1)” and to the Criminal Procedure Code as the “CPC”) to summarily reject the appeal.
[note: 3]
 The letter was addressed to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and a copy was extended to the appellant. However, no response was received from the latter. At my direction, no order was made as to the Prosecution’s request and the parties attended before me at the appointed time for the hearing of this appeal. The appeal was heard over two days and two rounds of submissions were filed.
3       After careful consideration of the arguments presented, I dismissed the appeal. I now set out the grounds for my decision. I do so chiefly with a view towards clarifying two points of criminal procedure which arose in this case. The first is the ambit of this court’s power to summarily reject an appeal under s 384(1) and, more specifically, the meaning of the expression “question of law” in s 384(1). The second is the proper procedure to adopt if an accused wishes to plead guilty to a charge but nevertheless intends to challenge the constitutionality of the punishment statutorily prescribed for the offence. This touches on, among other things, the ambit of s 375 of the CPC, which governs the right of appeal afforded to an accused convicted following a plea of guilt. In examining these issues, I will build on the comments I made in 
Mohd Fauzi bin Mohamed Mydin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 313
 (“
Mohd Fauzi
”).
Background
4       The facts of the offence were concisely set out in the statement of facts (“SOF”) to which the appellant admitted without qualification. On 2 April 2014, the appellant, then 41 years of age, was arrested on suspicion that he had consumed a specified drug. On the day of his arrest, he provided two samples of urine which were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for testing. Later that month, analysts from the HSA issued a total of four certificates under s 16 of the MDA. The certificates stated that the urine samples had been analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine, both of which are specified drugs listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. Two charges under s 8(
b
)(ii) of the MDA (one each for monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine) were preferred against the appellant.
[note: 4]
5       Section 33A(1)
(d)
 of the MDA provides that an accused is liable for enhanced punishment if two conjunctive conditions are met, 
ie
 that he had “one previous admission and one previous conviction for consumption of a specific drug under section 8
(b)
”. Both charges against the appellant specified that (a) first, he had previously been convicted of consuming cannabinol derivatives, a specified drug, in 1997 and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment; and that (b) second, he had previously been admitted to an “approved institution” (the Cluster B (Changi Prison Complex) Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”)) for consuming morphine, which is also a specified drug, in 2010.
[note: 5]
 The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of consuming monoacetylmorphine and consented to having the charge for the consumption of methamphetamine taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
[note: 6]
6       The appellant’s other antecedents were all drug-related. He had prior convictions for possessing controlled drugs (in 1995 and 2011) and he had been the subject of two separate drug supervision orders (in 1998 and 2012). In mitigation, Mr Kumar submitted that the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation were favourable and urged the court to impose the mandatory minimum sentence on him. The Prosecution did not object to this. On 5 August 2015, the District Judge sentenced the appellant to the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
[note: 7]
7       The appellant filed an appeal the very next day. In his petition of appeal (“the petition”) which was filed on 28 August 2015, the sole ground of appeal raised was that his sentence was invalid because he did not, despite what was stated in the charge and in the SOF, satisfy the two conjunctive conditions for enhanced punishment set out in s 33A(1) of the MDA. Specifically, he took issue with the use of his admission to the DRC in 2010 as a condition for the imposition of enhanced punishment. On this, he submitted as follows:
[note: 8]
[The appellant] humbly appeals against the sentence on the grounds [sic] that the charge under s 33A(1) of MDA is erroneous as he was taken out from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) even before he had received any counselling or treatment such that reliance on the DRC admission is wrong.
8       On 4 September 2015, the Crime Registry of the State Courts wrote to inform parties that an electronic copy of the Record of Appeal had been uploaded onto the eLitigation system and could now be accessed. On 28 October 2015, the Registrar of the Supreme Court notified parties that the matter had been scheduled to be heard on 11 December 2015. On 20 November 2015, the hearing date was revised to 15 January 2016.
9       On 21 December 2015, the Prosecution wrote to invite the court to reject the appellant’s appeal summarily under s 384(1) of the CPC. Among other things, they pointed out that the appellant had, acting through Mr Kumar, sought the imposition of the minimum sentence in the court below. It was submitted that there was therefore plainly no basis for a reduction of the sentence and that the summary rejection of the appeal would save valuable judicial time and public resources.
[note: 9]
 Mr Kumar did not send a reply even though he received a copy of the letter. I will make further observations in this connection later. On 29 December 2015, I directed the Registry to inform the parties that the hearing date would stand and the parties then filed their submissions. Only the Prosecution did so in accordance with the prescribed timelines. Mr Kumar only did so on 14 January 2016 (one day before the hearing date) and he filed not one, but three sets of submissions.
The Prosecution’s application for summary rejection of the appeal
10     In 
Mohd Fauzi
 at [23], I explained that s 384(1) of the CPC provides that an appeal may be summarily rejected without first being set down for hearing if the following three conditions are satisfied:
(a)     First, the grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law (“condition 1”);
(b)     Second, it appears to the appellate court that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction (“condition 2”); and
(c)     Third, there is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the appellate court to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced (“condition 3”).
11     The Prosecution argued that the three conditions had been satisfied. Among other things, they submitted that the plea of guilt had been recorded in full compliance with the safeguards prescribed by the CPC and that it was plain that there was sufficient evidence to support the appellant’s conviction on the charge. In particular, they pointed to the fact that there was ample documentary evidence (in the form of certificates from the HSA and the like) to show that the requirements for enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) of the MDA had been satisfied. In the premises, they submitted that both the conviction and sentence imposed were in order and that the ground of appeal neither raised any question of law for determination nor provided any basis for a reduction of the sentence (which was already the minimum prescribed by law).
[note: 10]
12     I agreed with the Prosecution that conditions 2 and 3 had been satisfied. From my perusal of the record, it was clear that the relevant papers were in order and there was sufficient evidence to support the appellant’s conviction for a LT1 drug consumption charge. It was also clear, from the criminal records issued by the Criminal Records Office and the certificate of previous admission issued under s 33A(3) of the MDA, that the appellant had (a) been convicted of drug consumption in 1997 and (b) been admitted to the DRC in 2010.
[note: 11]
 That being the case, it would follow that the court is legally bound to impose the statutory minimum sentence prescribed and there was no basis upon which the court may consider that the sentence ought to be reduced. However, I did not agree that condition 1 (the grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law) had been satisfied.
The question of law requirement and the purpose of s 384(1)
13     A question of law is most commonly understood in contradistinction to its counterpart: a question of fact. Without placing too fine a point on it, the traditional position has been that the legal meaning of an enactment is quintessentially a question of law; whether a state of affairs exists in the world is eminently a question of fact; and whether a set of facts falls within the ambit of a statutory provision is a question of mixed fact and law (see 
Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v Bairstow and another
 
[1956] 1 AC 14
 at 30–31 
per
 Viscount Simonds). However, the line of demarcation between a question of law and a question of fact varies, as it must, depending on the context and the purpose to which the distinction is being put (see 
Novelty Dept Store Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue
 
[2016] 2 SLR 766
 at [22]–[23]). The parties did not address me on this issue at length, but given that this is the first time that this provision has been considered in depth, I thought it useful to examine the history of this provision as an aid to construction and to set out some of my thoughts on this issue.
14     A summary rejection procedure for criminal appeals was first introduced in our jurisdiction with the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Act No 24 of 1969) (I will refer to this statute and its legislative successors generically as the “SCJA”). Section 52 of the SCJA provided that the Court of Criminal Appeal would have the power to summarily reject an appeal if the three conditions set out at [10] above were satisfied. However, s 52 of the SCJA was not the progenitor of s 384(1); instead, it was itself based on s 58 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (Act 7 of 1964) (M’sia) (“Malaysian CJA”): see the explanatory statement to the Supreme Court of Judicature 1969 Bill (Bill 24 of 1969).
15     I will set out s 58 of the Malaysian CJA presently but before I do so I think it is important to note that the position in Singapore prior to 1964 differed from that in Malaysia (and Malaya before that) in two respects. First, an accused convicted in the High Court of Singapore was only afforded an appeal as of right if he wished to appeal against his conviction on a 
question of law alone
 (see Ord 5(a) Straits Settlements Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance (Cap 129, 1955 Rev Ed) (“SS CCA Ordinance”)). If an accused wished to appeal against (a) his conviction on a question of fact alone or on a question of mixed law and fact, or (b) if he wished to appeal against his sentence, then he required the leave of court (see Ord 5(
b
) and 5(
c
) SS CCA Ordinance). By contrast, the Criminal Procedure Code of the Federated Malay States (Cap 6, 1932 Rev Ed) (M’sia) (“FMS CPC”) afforded all accused persons an appeal as of right, irrespective of the ground of appeal raised. Second, and as I mentioned above, before the passage of the SCJA in 1969, no appellate court in Singapore had the power to summarily reject a criminal appeal. In the Federated Malay States, however, all criminal appeals could be summarily rejected under s 309 of the FMS CPC.
16     Section 309 of the FMS CPC provided as follows:
309(i)    On receiving the documents mentioned in the preceding section, the Judge shall peruse the same, and if he considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering he may reject the appeal summarily; 
provided that no appeal shall be rejected summarily except in the case mentioned in subsection (ii) unless the appellant or his advocate has had a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same
.
309(ii)    Where an appeal is brought on the ground that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence or that the sentence in question is excessive and it appears to the Judge that 
the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and that there is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead him to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced the appeal may without being set down for hearing be summarily rejected
 by an order under his hand certifying that he has perused the record and is satisfied that the appeal has been lodged without any sufficient ground of complaint.
[emphasis added]
17     These differences had to be resolved when the Federation of Malaysia was formed. At the time of merger, there were three extant Supreme Courts, each comprising a Court of Appeal and a High Court, in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, and in the Borneo States. With the passage of the Malaysia Act 1963 (Act 26 of 1963) (M’sia), these Supreme Courts were replaced by three High Courts – one each in Malaya, Singapore, and Borneo – and a Federal Court, which exercised exclusive appellate jurisdiction over matters heard by the High Courts. Given this change, there was a need to harmonise the divergent appellate procedures in the States. This provided the impetus for the passage of the Malaysian CJA, s 58 of which read as follows:
Where the grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law and it appears to the Lord President and two other Judges of the Federal Court that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and that there is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead the Federal Court to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced, the appeal may, 
without being set down for hearing
, be summarily rejected by an order under the hand of the Lord President, certifying that the said Judges, having perused the record, are satisfied that the appeal has been brought without any sufficient ground of complaint and notice of the rejection shall be served upon the appellant: … [emphasis added]
18     Section 58 of the Malaysian CJA was, in essence, an updated version of s 309 of the FMS CPC, which was adopted in preference to the position in Singapore (and the Borneo States, where accused persons likewise required the leave of court to bring an appeal) as a model to be applied throughout the Federation. However, there is one important difference. The FMS CPC distinguished between appeals which would be summarily rejected after the appellant or his advocate had a reasonable opportunity to be heard and those which could be dismissed without the need for the appellant to be heard. The latter could only be done where it appeared to the Judge that there is “no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right or lead him to consider that the sentence ought to be reduced” – basically, conditions 2 and 3. By contrast, s 58 of the Malaysian CJA did not distinguish between cases where the appellant and his advocate were to be heard and those where they were not. However, it provided, in addition to conditions 2 and 3, one further requirement that had to be satisfied before an appeal could be summarily rejected: the grounds of appeal must not contain a question of law. This is the origin of the question of law requirement, which I have referred to as condition 1 in these grounds.
19     Paragraph 9(a) of the explanatory statement to the Courts of Judicature Bill 1963 (Malaysia) provides a vital clue as to the reason for the introduction of condition 1:
Clause 58 (summary rejection of appeal) brings the law in Singapore and Borneo in line with that of Malaya. At present in Singapore and Borneo a convicted person who wishes to appeal on grounds of fact only or against sentence only must obtain leave to appeal from a single Judge. 
In Malaya he can appeal as of right but his appeal can be 
summarily rejected if three Judges consider it has no hope of success
. It is thought that the existing system in Malaya makes for 
expedition and affords ample safeguards to appellants
.
 [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
20     When the drafters of the Malaysian CJA elected for the position in the FMS CPC over that adopted in Singapore and the Borneo States, they were conscious that there was a need to balance the desire to provide greater access to appeals against the need for “expedition” and efficiency in the administration of justice. This was achieved through an expansion of the power of summary rejection. Under s 58 of the Malaysian CJA, appeals which had “no hope of success” may be summarily rejected without the need for the appellant to be heard. However, the caveat was that those applications which raised questions of law (the determination of which is traditionally the preserve of an appellate court) would automatically proceed for an oral hearing before the Federal Court. This allocation of roles was not new and it reflected the traditional deference of appellate courts to factual findings made by courts of first instance. This had 
always
 been a part of the law in Singapore and the Borneo States before merger. Even before the Malaysia CJA was passed, the SS CCA Ordinance had distinguished between appeals which were premised on questions of law only (which may be brought as of right) and appeals which were premised on questions of fact (which lay only with leave): see [15] above.
21     The Parliament of the newly independent Singapore adopted s 58 of the Malaysian CJA as s 52 of the SCJA without effecting any substantial changes to it. Section 52 of the SCJA remained largely unchanged (and also largely unused) until the passage of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010), which repealed and re-enacted s 52 of the SCJA as s 384(1) of the CPC. Save for the addition of s 384(2) – which states that in cases where the appellate court comprises more than one judge, a decision to summarily reject an appeal must be made unanimously – the provision was unchanged. From this, it may be inferred that the policy intent underlying s 384 mirrors that of the original enactment and may be relied on by the courts as a guide towards the exercise of their power of summary rejection.
22     To summarise, the pertinent policy considerations are as follows:
(a)     Section 384 was introduced to strike a balance between two competing imperatives: (i) access to justice – all accused persons should be able to appeal as of right; and (ii) expedition and efficiency in the administration of justice – to avoid placing an undue burden on the judicial system.
(b)     The summary rejection procedure allows appeals to be dismissed 
in limine
, without any need for an oral hearing to be convened. However, the power of summary rejection should only be exercised in respect of appeals which are 
ex facie
 unsustainable and have “no hope of success”.
(c)     The summary rejection procedure may only be exercised in respect of appeals which do not contain a question of law. The traditional definition of “question of law” – 
ie
, that which is not a question of fact – applies here. This ensures that only matters which are more suited to appellate determination will proceed for an oral hearing as a matter of course, whereas those which turn on findings of fact (in respect of which deference is traditionally given to the trial court’s findings) may be dismissed summarily.
Why this case was not suitable for summary rejection
23     With these points in mind, I turn to the facts of this case. In advancing the case that the petition presented no question of law for determination, the Prosecution made the following points:
[note: 12]
(a)     Section 375 of the CPC provides that an accused who has pleaded guilty and been convicted on that plea may only appeal against the extent or legality of his sentence.
(b)     The Appellant had pleaded guilty voluntarily at the advice of counsel and the procedural safeguards set out in the CPC had been adhered to.
(c)     Mr Kumar had confirmed that the appellant understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that he intended to admit to the charge.
(d)     Mr Kumar had specifically requested that the court pass the minimum sentence prescribed by law on his client.
24     In my judgment, these points go towards an assessment of the 
merits
 or the 
bona fides
 of the appeal, but not to the character of the question posed. The sole ground raised in the petition was whether the charge was erroneous because it was premised on the appellant’s 2010 admission to the DRC, even though the appellant had allegedly not received any counselling or treatment during his time in the DRC. This engages an inquiry which touches on issues of general principle relating, at least in part, to the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the MDA. It seemed to me that this was 
prima facie
 a question of law, or at least a question of mixed fact and law. This case was quite different from 
Mohd Fauzi
, where the sole ground of appeal raised by the appellant was that his sentence (the minimum provided for by law) was manifestly excessive. This was clearly not a question of law within the meaning of the summary rejection procedure because s 384(5) of the CPC expressly states that the “question of whether a sentence ought to be reduced shall be deemed not to be a question of law”.
25     It appeared to me that the Prosecution’s chief complaint was not that no question of law had been posed at all, but that the question of law posed did not present itself as a 
bona fide
 question deserving of appellate consideration. This was evident during the substantive hearing of the appeal, where the Prosecution argued forcefully that the appellant ought to have raised this point in the court below and that the issue of law raised in the petition was well-settled.
[note: 13]
 As will be clear in the course of these grounds, I eventually agreed with the Prosecution on both of these points, but they were not enough to justify the summary rejection of the appeal without affording the parties a right of hearing. Section 384(1) does not call on the court to assess the 
merits
 of the question of law or whether it has been put forward in a 
timely
 manner, but merely to ascertain that such a question has been posed.
26     This may be thought of as unsatisfactory, for appellants may seek to evade the summary rejection procedure by including a question of law, irrespective of its merit. However, it should be remembered that the power granted to the court under s 384(1) is draconian: it empowers the court to reject an appeal summarily before any submissions have been tendered and before the matter has even been set down for hearing. Therefore, the exercise of this power must be attended with “ample safeguards” (see [19] above), one of which is the requirement that only appeals which do not raise relevant questions of law may be summarily dismissed. This is eminently a policy decision which reflects, among other things, the traditional allocation of responsibilities between appellate courts and courts of first instance, and it is still a feature of our jurisprudence today (see 
Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601
 at [32]).
27     One example of a case which might be suitable for summary determination would be an appeal against a minimum sentence on the ground that it is manifestly excessive. In our constitutional system, Parliament is vested with the power to make laws prescribing the punishments for any defined offence, whether fixed or within a defined range, and the duty of the courts is to pass sentence according to law (see 
Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v Public Prosecutor
 
[2012] 4 SLR 947
 (“
Mohammad Faizal
”) at [45]). An appeal against a minimum sentence ought to be dismissed out of hand because it is bound to fail: the relief prayed for is not within the power of the courts to give. Another example would be where the appeal suffers from a crucial jurisdictional deficit. Take, for example, an appellant who seeks to appeal a decision made in a Magistrate’s Appeal. Such an appeal is a complete non-starter because it is well-established that the Court of Appeal does not have the authority to entertain an appeal from a decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction (see 
Public Prosecutor v Lim Yong Soon Bernard
 
[2015] 3 SLR 717
 at [32]).
28     Of course, these two scenarios cannot be exhaustive of the circumstances when the court would be justified in exercising its power under s 384(1), but they provide useful touchstones. Ultimately, the power under s 384(1) is a discretionary power, and like all discretionary powers, it must be exercised judiciously and with due regard for the object and purposes of its grant, which were set out at [22] above.
An observation on the duty of counsel in s 384(1) applications
29     The foregoing encapsulates my reasons for not exercising my power under s 384(1). Before I leave this point, however, I think it is important to make an observation about a point of practice in relation to the summary rejection procedure. Technically, the power of summary rejection is one which the court may exercise of its own motion. For example, in 
Chan Heng Pye v Public Prosecutor
 [1961] 1 MLJ 161 the court exercised the power of summary rejection of its own motion under s 309 of the FMS CPC. In the usual course of things, however, it will be the respondent who urges the court to exercise its powers under s 384(1) by way of a letter, as was done here. Although it is not expressly provided for in the CPC, a copy of that letter should be extended to counsel for the appellant. The Prosecution had done so here.
30     Upon receipt of such a letter, unless his client’s instructions are not to oppose the call for summary rejection under s 384(1), it is incumbent upon the counsel for the appellant to reply, even if no specific directions are given by the court for this to be done. The reason for this is simple. The course of action being contemplated – the summary rejection of the appeal – is entirely to the appellant’s disadvantage. It is necessary that the appellant or his counsel (should he be represented) tender a reply conveying his position to the court. There is not to say that parties should engage in litigation by correspondence, but a short reply containing the salient points of objection and brief reasons why summary rejection is appropriate should be drafted. As I observed to Mr Kumar during the hearing, his failure to reply did his client a great disservice. If no response is received, the court might well assume that none is forthcoming and that the appellant has nothing to say in response and this could be entirely to the appellant’s detriment.
The substantive appeal
31     I now turn to the substantive appeal. On 15 January 2016, the parties attended before me. On that occasion, Mr Kumar argued that an admission to the DRC would be unconstitutional if it did not last for a minimum period of six months and, consequently, such an admission could not form the condition precedent for enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) of the MDA. As this was a new argument which the Prosecution had not anticipated in their submissions, which had been duly filed in accordance with the prescribed timelines (unlike Mr Kumar’s, which were only filed immediately prior to the hearing), I adjourned the matter to allow the Prosecution time to prepare further written submissions in response. This was done and on 16 March 2016, the matter was restored for hearing.
The appellant’s arguments
32     Mr Kumar’s core point was that a DRC stint which lasts for less than six months and/or which is not accompanied by treatment or rehabilitative programmes 
cannot
 be an “admission” within the meaning of s 33A(1)(
d
) read with s 33A(5)(
c
) of the MDA.
[note: 14]
 This was the same argument which I had considered and rejected in 
Lee Chuan Meng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 2 SLR 892
 (“
Lee Chuan Meng
”). Mr Kumar accepted that my decision in 
Lee Chuan Meng
 represents the law.
[note: 15]
 However, he contended that there is a constitutional angle to this argument which was not considered in 
Lee Chuan Meng
’s case which warrants a reconsideration of this submission.
33     The essence of his argument, as far as I understand it, was as follows. The admission of a person to DRC is 
prima facie
 unconstitutional because it results in the deprivation of a person’s liberty and thus violates Art 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”).
[note: 16]
 This act of detention can only be valid if it falls within the scope of Art 9(6)(
b
) of the Constitution, which specifically excepts laws “relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorises the arrest and detention of any person for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation” from the prohibitions in Art 9 of the Constitution.
[note: 17]
 However, the appellant’s admission to DRC in 2010, which lasted for less than five months and which was not accompanied by treatment and rehabilitation, could not have been for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation and therefore falls outside Art 9(6).
[note: 18]
 Therefore, the appellant’s admission to DRC was unconstitutional and, 
ex hypothesi
, the LT1 sentence which was imposed on him on the back of that previous admission would itself be unconstitutional.
34     In my judgment, this submission was plainly without merit. Before I proceed to explain why, I will first deal with the Prosecution’s preliminary objection, which was that the appeal ought to have been dismissed 
in limine
 because it was procedurally defective.
Preliminary objection
35     The Prosecution submitted that the appeal, while purporting to be one against sentence, was in truth an appeal against the appellant’s conviction. This was something which the appellant was absolutely precluded from doing because s 375 of the CPC specifies that a person who has been convicted following a plea of guilt may only appeal against the extent or legality of his sentence. They argued, citing [32] of 
Mohd Fauzi
, that any challenge to the sentence imposed ought, if at all, to have proceeded by way of an application for criminal revision, rather than an appeal.
[note: 19]
 I did not agree.
36     The appellant had been charged for an offence involving the consumption of a specified drug. He did not challenge the allegation that he had consumed a specified drug. He also did not dispute that he should be punished according to law for having committed this offence. However, his complaint was that he ought not to face 
enhanced
 punishment for it as his spell in DRC in 2010 did not, properly construed, count as an “admission” within the meaning of s 33A of the MDA. When presented in this light, it is clear that the appellant was challenging the 
legality
 of his LT1 sentence, which he was clearly entitled to do under s 375 of the CPC.
37     As Chan Sek Keong CJ explained in 
Mohammad Faizal
 at [46] and [47], the conditions listed in s 33A(1) of the MDA are statutory aggravating factors the satisfaction of which trigger the application of a legislatively-prescribed minimum punishment. Previous admissions and convictions which satisfy the conditions listed in s 33A(1) of the MDA are included in the charge in order that the accused may have fair notice that the Prosecution intends to prove their existence to justify the imposition of an enhanced sentence (see 123(6) of the CPC). However, they are not elements of the offence of drug consumption 
per se
. The appellant may challenge the legality of the enhanced sentence imposed on him on the ground that these aggravating factors are absent without contravening s 375 of the CPC. Having said this, I must emphasise that my comments are confined only to the LT1 sentencing regime as it is set out in s 33A of the MDA. The position might be quite different if the statutory aggravating factor in question were a constitutive element of the offence.
38     The facts of 
Mohd Fauzi
, which the Prosecution cited, were quite different. There, the appellant had pleaded guilty to an offence of consuming morphine. As he had previously been convicted and sentenced to an LT1 sentence in 1999, he was liable under s 33A(2) of the MDA to face a minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (commonly referred to as an “LT2” sentence). The district judge imposed the minimum LT2 sentence on him and he appealed. On appeal, he explained that his complaint was with his 1999 (LT1) conviction. He argued that he ought not to have been charged in 1999 as the concentrations of drugs found in his urine samples then were very low. He therefore submitted that his LT1 conviction ought to be set aside and, as a consequence, the LT2 sentence imposed on him for the present offence likewise had to be set aside.
39     I rejected that argument in 
Mohd Fauzi
 as an impermissible attempt to mount a back-door challenge to his 1999 LT1 conviction (at [18]). Were he genuinely aggrieved by his LT1 conviction, the proper recourse would have been for him to file an application for criminal revision to quash it, as the applicant in 
Bhavashbhai slo Baboobhai v Public Prosecutor
 [2015] 2 SLR 1281, who also sought to set aside his LT2 sentence by challenging the legality of his prior LT1 conviction, unsuccessfully sought to do. My point was that the legality of his 1999 LT1 conviction was not and could not form part of the subject matter of his appeal against his LT2 sentence. This was what I was referring to when I said at [32] of 
Mohd Fauzi
 that “[i]f there is any quarrel with the legality or validity of the conviction [
ie
, the appellant’s 1999 LT1 conviction] … [t]he proper course is not to file an appeal against sentence but a criminal revision”.
40     In this case, the appellant’s quarrel is not with the propriety of his present conviction for drug consumption, or with any of his previous convictions for drug consumption, but with the use of his admission to the DRC in 2010 as a condition precedent for the imposition of an LT1 sentence for his present offence. In my judgment, this could properly form the subject matter of an appeal against the legality of his sentence, and there was no need for it to have proceeded solely by way of an application for a criminal revision.
41     However, I agreed with the Prosecution’s alternative submission, which was that it would have been preferable for the appellant to have applied to the District Court for a case to be stated on a question of law concerning the effect of a provision of the Constitution pursuant to s 395(2)(
a
) of the CPC if it had genuinely been his intent all along to raise such an issue for the court’s determination.
[note: 20]
 This was done, for example, in 
Mohammad Faizal
 where the applicant (who, incidentally, was also represented by Mr Kumar) had pleaded guilty but had applied, 
before
 he was sentenced, to state a case on the constitutionality of the LT1 regime. Regrettably, this was not done here.
42     The District Judge heard the appellant’s matter over two days – on 1 July and 5 August 2015 – and 
no
 mention was made by Mr Kumar of the appellant’s dissatisfaction with the LT1 charge at any time. Instead, the indication was always that the appellant would be admitting to the charge without qualification and was content with the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence, which was what he sought in mitigation.
[note: 21]
 The filing of the appeal on 6 August 2015, therefore, came as a surprise. On 11 August 2015, the parties attended before the District Judge to hear the appellant’s application for bail pending appeal. When the District Judge asked Mr Kumar why the matter of the legality of the LT1 sentence had not been raised previously, he could only reply, blithely, that “[t]he State Courts are not seised with jurisdiction to hear such issues, that’s why it was not mounted earlier.”
[note: 22]
 This explanation is not convincing in the slightest.
43     It was always open, as Mr Kumar would have been well aware, for the trial court, either on its own motion or on the application of the appellant or the Prosecution, to state a case. This could have been done from the outset, even before the appellant had pleaded guilty, and would have saved time and costs. It would have obviated the need for a hearing to determine the grant of bail pending appeal and it would have put the Prosecution on notice that a constitutional argument would be raised, allowing them to tender a comprehensive set of submissions from the start, without the need for an adjournment. This was not done. Instead, the submissions containing the constitutional arguments were only raised in submissions tendered just one day before the hearing of the appeal.
44     It was evident from what Mr Kumar informed the District Judge on 11 August 2015 that he had intended all along to mount a submission on constitutional validity but had chosen not to expressly advert to this in his petition of appeal. Mr Kumar chose to leave it until the eleventh hour to articulate his submission. The overall impression is that the matter was deliberately and cynically being protracted, for ends or purposes that are not clear, leaving one in serious doubt as to the 
bona fides
 of the submission.
Analysis of the appellant’s arguments
45     I now turn to the substance of the appellant’s arguments. Mr Kumar’s submission, shortly put, was that the appellant’s LT1 sentence, which was based on an unconstitutional admission to the DRC, was itself unconstitutional and therefore had to be set aside. In my judgment, this submission must fail for one simple reason: It was never disputed that the appellant had taken drugs in 2010 and that it was pursuant to that act of consumption that he was admitted to the DRC. As I explained in 
Lee Chuan Meng
 at [20], the “basic precondition” for the imposition of an LT1 sentence is that it must be proved that the accused has consumed a controlled drug on at least two previous occasions. The fact that the appellant was admitted to the DRC in 2010 pursuant to a positive drug test, together with his prior conviction for drug consumption in 1997, satisfies this basic precondition.
46     The fact that the appellant’s detention might be unconstitutional – either because he did not receive any treatment while in the DRC or because the detention did not last for at least six months – is neither here nor there as it does not change the fact that he had consumed drugs on a previous occasion. Provided that the DRC admission had been ordered following a determination that he had consumed a controlled drug, it would be entirely proper for the courts to take the appellant’s prior DRC admission into account in deciding whether he qualifies for an LT1 sentence. If the appellant’s constitutional rights had truly been violated, he might potentially seek redress in other ways but those would be matters which fall to be decided in different 
fora
 and through different forms of legal process, but it cannot be of any relevance to the present appeal. This was, in essence, the same point I made in 
Lee Chuan Meng
 at [22]–[23], though not in a constitutional context.
47     Alone, this would be sufficient to dispose of this matter. For completeness, however, I will go on to explain why I did not agree with Mr Kumar’s submission that the appellant’s admission to the DRC in 2010 was unconstitutional.
48     As a preliminary point, I first observe that Mr Kumar’s reference to Art 9(6) of the Constitution was a complete 
non sequitur
 (see [33] above). Article 9(6) is a savings provision which narrows the scope of the substantive enactments which precede it. It states that no 
law
 shall be invalid merely by reason of the fact that it does not comply with either Arts 9(3) or 9(4). Both of these articles relate to the requirements of procedural due process which accompany any act of detention: Art 9(3) relates to the right to be informed of the grounds of one’s arrest and the right of access to counsel; Art 9(4) relates to the right to have the legality of one’s detention reviewed by a Magistrate. However, the appellant had not argued that either of these rights was violated when he was admitted to the DRC in 2010. Instead, his complaint was that his DRC admission constituted an unsanctioned deprivation of his liberty – this was a matter which engaged Art 9(1), not Arts 9(3) or 9(4) of the Constitution.
49     Article 9(1) of the Constitution provides that “[n]o person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.” As the High Court explained in 
Tan Eng Hong v Attorney General
 
[2013] 4 SLR 1059
 at [26], Art 9(1) has a Janus-faced quality to it: on the one hand, it 
proscribes
 deprivations of life and liberty 
unless they are sanctioned by law
; on the other hand, it also 
permits
 deprivations of life and liberty which are carried out 
in accordance with law
. I accepted Mr Kumar’s submission that an admission and detention of a person in DRC results in a deprivation of liberty.
[note: 23]
 However, s 34(2)(
b
) of the MDA (which, as an Act of Parliament, is undoubtedly a law-creating instrument) explicitly authorises the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“the Director”) to order a person to be detained in an approved institution for a period of time to “undergo treatment and rehabilitation” if he is satisfied, following a medical examination or the results of the person’s urine tests, that such admission is necessary.
50     The question, therefore, is whether the appellant’s 2010 admission to the DRC falls within the terms of s 34(2) of the MDA and is therefore a legally-sanctioned deprivation of the appellant’s liberty. In answer to this, the Prosecution pointed out that it was not disputed that the appellant was (a) admitted pursuant to an order made by the Director, (b) the stated purpose of the order was for the appellant “to undergo treatment and rehabilitation”, and (c) this admission was premised on the results of positive urine tests which established that the appellant had consumed morphine. It was submitted that the appellant’s admission to the DRC in 2010 adhered to the requirements in s 34(2) of the MDA and was therefore a legally-sanctioned act of detention which comported with the requirements of the Constitution.
[note: 24]
51     Mr Kumar challenged this on three broad grounds:
(a)     First he argued that the Prosecution had not done enough to discharge its 
evidential
 burden of showing that the admission order was 
actuated
 by the motive of subjecting the person to treatment and rehabilitation. He contended that the Prosecution had to go beyond what was said in the documents of admission and adduce positive evidence to explain, among other things, why the appellant had been released before the expiry of six months and why the appellant had (allegedly) not received any treatment during his time in detention.
[note: 25]
(b)     Second, and in the alternative, Mr Kumar argued that it was not enough that a stint in the DRC was 
actuated
 by the motive of subjecting the person to treatment and rehabilitation if it did not last for at least six months. He submitted that under s 34(3) of the MDA, every admission to the DRC must last for least six months. 
[note: 26]
(c)     Third, he submitted that any admission that is either unaccompanied by any treatment and rehabilitation programmes – as he said was the case with the appellant’s 2010 admission to the DRC – would be purely punitive. Insofar as this was contemplated by s 34(2) of the MDA, it was unconstitutional, as it amounted to a vesting of what is exclusively an instance of the judicial power (the power to punish) in the executive.
[note: 27]
52     In my judgment, Mr Kumar’s first submission turned the matter on its head. As the Court of Appeal noted in 
Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney General
 
[2012] 2 SLR 49
 at [47], a presumption of legality attaches to the acts of public officials. Absenting positive evidence to the contrary, the good faith of public officials and the validity of their actions must be presumed. The burden was on the appellant to establish that the Director had exercised his discretion in an unlawful manner and he had not done so. Even if it were assumed that the appellant did not receive any treatment or rehabilitation in the DRC, it would be unwarranted to infer from this that the Director had exercised his power improperly by ordering an admission in the first instance.
53     As for his second contention, it rests on a plain misreading of s 34(3) of the MDA. Section 34(3) provides that “[e]very person who is admitted to an approved institution under this section shall be detained in the institution for a period of 6 months 
unless he is discharged earlier by the Director or the Review Committee of the institution
” [emphasis added]. It is clear that it does not 
mandate
 that every stint at the DRC must last for at least six months.
54     In support of his third contention, Mr Kumar relied heavily on the following passage from the decision of the High Court of Australia in 
Chu Kheng Lim and others v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and another
 (1992) 110 ALR 97 (“
Chu Kheng Lim
”) at 118–119:
In the light of what has been said above, the two sections will be valid laws if the detention which they require and authorise is limited to what is reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation or necessary to enable an application for an entry permit to be made and considered. On the other hand, if the detention which those sections require and authorise is not so limited, the authority which they purportedly confer upon the Executive cannot properly be seen as an incident of the executive powers to exclude, admit and deport an alien. In that event, 
they will be of a punitive nature and contravene Ch III's insistence that the judicial power of the Commonwealth be vested exclusively in the courts which it designates
. [emphasis added]
55     In my judgment, Mr Kumar’s reliance on 
Chu Kheng Lim
 was misplaced. The question there was whether certain statutory provisions which provided for the compulsory detention of non-citizens pending their expulsion or deportation were unconstitutional because they amounted to a vesting of the judicial power to punish in the executive. In answering this question in the negative, the court held that the power to detain a person for the purposes of expulsion or deportation was not punitive in character, and was instead properly classified as an incident of the executive powers of exclusion, admission and deportation (see 
Chu Kheng Lim
 at 120). Likewise, s 34(2)(
b
) of the MDA permits the detention of an individual for the “purpose” of “treatment and rehabilitation”. This power of detention granted under s 34(2) of the MDA is properly seen as an incident of the executive power to administer the laws relating to the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts under Part IV of the MDA and it would, as Chan CJ put it in 
Mohammad Faizal
 at [49], “be inaccurate to characterise a DRC admission as inflicting punishment”. There is therefore no basis for concluding that s 34(2) transgresses the principle of the separation of powers.
Conclusion
56     At the end of the day, even though the appellant tried to cloak his arguments in constitutional garb, he had not gone beyond what the appellant in 
Lee Chuan Meng
 tried to do, which was to urge this court to hold that an admission to the DRC has to last for at least six months and be accompanied by treatment and rehabilitation before it could be used as a condition precedent for the imposition of LT1 punishment. This was an argument which had already been carefully considered and rejected.
57     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal.

 District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:
Introduction
Background 
1       When we hear of a foreign worker injuring himself as a result of an industrial accident we are instantly moved to sympathy. This is understandably so. A foreign worker is far away from home, labouring to achieve a better life for kin and kind. Any injury suffered may have repercussions beyond the bodily pain and suffering. The corollary is an instinctive assumption that his employer had placed efficiency, costs and monetary concerns over safety considerations. The blame for the injury is capriciously assigned to the employer. However, that an accident has occurred at work resulting in injury does not by itself prove that the employer has breached his duty at law. Each case must be appraised on its facts. Further, not every employer of an injured worker is the callous businessman in relentless pursuit of profits; no more than every injured worker is the hapless victim of an employer’s oversight.
2       Wang Baoshun, the Plaintiff in this case is a Chinese national who was employed as a construction worker by B19 Technologies Pte Ltd, the Defendant at a construction site at Beach Road (“the Site”). The Site was a registered factory and/or workplace to which the provisions of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (“the Act”) and its subsidiary legislations were applicable. According to the Plaintiff, on 26 May 2013 at about 2.30pm, during the course of employment, he was using a hammer to knock a nail through a corrugated metal sheet into a timber plank at the Site when the nail suddenly broke and a piece of it flew into his left eye (“the accident”).

3       After the accident, the Plaintiff went to the hospital for examination. Upon examination, he was found to have a superficial corneal abrasion in the left eye. There was no penetrating injury and a microscopic hyphaema
[note: 2]
 was seen. He was treated with eye-drops (topical lubricants, antibiotics and cycloplegic). When he was reviewed the following day at the Singapore National Eye Centre, the corneal abrasion was noted to have completely healed. The medical condition of the Plaintiff was found in a medical report dated 9 June 2014 (“Medical Report”).
[note: 3]
 The Medical Report, which was tendered by the Plaintiff, is a key document in this case and is reproduced in the annex to this judgment.
Medical treatment
4       On 29 May 2013, the Plaintiff attended a medical review and was given medical leave until 2 June 2013. The Plaintiff told Chen ShiMing, the site supervisor that he was given 2 days of medical leave even though he was given 7 days of medical leave.
[note: 4]
5       The Defendant duly paid the Plaintiff according to the Plaintiff’s medical leave entitlement. On 3 June 2013, the Plaintiff returned to work and continued working as before. The Plaintiff informed his supervisor that he was well and that he did not require any further claims.
[note: 5]
 On 5 June 2013, the Plaintiff went for medical review again, but no medical leave was given. At this review, the doctor confirmed that the hyphaema had completely resolved and the cornea was clear.
[note: 6]
 The Defendant continued to pay the Plaintiff’s wages for the days off he took to go for medical review.
[note: 7]
6       The Medical Report also revealed that the Defendant had a pre-existing condition in the left eye. In the first paragraph of the Medical Report, it was noted that the Plaintiff had
“…
a history of previous trauma to his left eye with subsequent cataract surgery some twenty-five years ago following which he had poor vision
.”
7       According to the Medical Report, the Plaintiff’s left eye was aphakia, which referred to the absence of the lens in the eye after cataract surgery. In other words, the Plaintiff had been without a lens in his left eye for some twenty-five years prior to the accident. As a result, he had poor vision.
[note: 8]
8       At the medical review on 5 June 2013, the Plaintiff indicated to the doctor an interest in having a secondary lens implant for his pre-existing condition. The said surgery for secondary lens implant to rectify his pre-existing condition was carried out on 14 May 2014. His post-surgery recovery was uneventful.
[note: 9]
 The Defendant paid for the secondary lens implant surgery. The costs came up to about $9,000.
9       After the accident, and up to the day of the secondary lens implant surgery (from 3 June 2013 to 13 May 2014), the Plaintiff continued to work for the Defendant without any difficulties and with no changes to his work scope. His work permit was renewed in or about December 2013 so that he could continue working for the Plaintiff.
10     After the secondary lens implant surgery however, from 28 May 2014 to 1 August 2014, the Plaintiff stopped work.
[note: 10]
 He told the Defendant that he was waiting to receive his workman compensation. The Plaintiff went for a medical review on or about 23 June 2014 and requested for medical leave. The doctor refused to give any. On 1 August 2014. The Plaintiff informed the Defendant that he wished to return home to China and requested for money from the Defendant. The Defendant gave the Plaintiff a goodwill sum of S$1,500 and paid for the Defendant’s air ticket home. On 29 Sept 2014, one and half years after the accident, the Plaintiff commenced action against the Defendant through Hoh Law Corporation.
The Plaintiff’s claims
11     The Plaintiff contends that he had not been provided or issued with safety goggles or proper personal protective equipment to carry out his work safely.
[note: 11]
 He says that the Defendant had thus failed to fulfil the duty of the employer by ensuring that adequate safety measures were taken.
12     The Plaintiff therefore claims general damages and also special damages for expenses and losses already incurred and estimated future expenses and losses resulting from the accident.
[note: 12]
Issues 
13     The issues in this case are therefore as follows:
(a)     Was the Plaintiff provided or issued with safety goggles or proper personal protective equipment to carry out his work safely?
(b)     If so, did the Plaintiff use the safety googles provided to him?
(c)     Did the Plaintiff have a pre-existing medical condition in his left eye?
(d)     What was the nature of the work that the Plaintiff carried out for the Defendant after the accident?
The law 
Employer’s common law duties
14     The relevant law is uncontroversial.
15     In 
Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd
 
[1999] 4 SLR 579
 (“
Parno
”). the Court of Appeal cited the case of 
Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co v English
 
[1938] AC 57
 where the House of Lords stated the following at page 78:
 
“The obligation [owed by the employer to the employee] is threefold - to provide a competent staff of men: adequate material: and a proper system and effective supervision.”
 
16     The scope of an employer’s duty to provide a proper system of work was set out by the Court of Appeal in 
Parno
 at paragraph 46 of the judgment as follows:
“
For the purpose[s] of this case, the aspect of the duty which was in issue was that [relating to] a proper system of work. The employer must devise a suitable system and instruct his men in what they must do: see Pape v Cumbria County Council [1992] 3 All ER 211. In devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduce the effects of an employee’s own carelessness: see General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas 
[1953] AC 180
 at 189 -190 per Lord Reid. The employer must also take reasonable care to ensure that his system is complied with, but he is not obliged ‘to stand over workmen of age and experience at every moment they are working ... to see that they do what they are supposed to do: see Woods v Durable Suites Ltd [1953] 2 All ER 391 at 395C’; [1953] IWLR 857 at 862 per Singleton LJ
”.
17     The Court of Appeal in 
Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction
 (1988) Pte Ltd 
[2009] SGHC 6
, at [42]:
“
… the duty imposed on the employer is to devise a safe system of work. In coming up with a safe system of work the employer is entitled to take into account various factors, including the employee’s experience, the employee’s job scope and any safety considerations that may arise. Thus, for the purposes of deciding whether or not an employer has devised a safe system of work, each case must turn on its own facts as different cases involving different occupations and/or different worksites must necessarily give rise to different considerations.”
18     The High Court sounded a note of caution in approaching industrial accident cases. In 
Chua Ah Beng v C & P Holdings Pte Ltd
 
[2001] SGHC 88
, at paragraphs [38] & [39]:
“
However, the fact remains that the plaintiff did slip, fall and sustain serious injuries. Everyone would sympathise with him over the accident. Nevertheless in deciding the merits of his claim, we do well to take heed of Lord Thankerton’s reminder in Glasgow Corporation v Mui 
[1943] AC 448
 at 454—455 that
:
 
“The Court must be careful to place itself in the position of the person charged with the duty and to consider what he or she should have reasonably anticipated as a natural and probable consequence of neglect, and not to give undue weight to the fact that a distressing accident has happened...”
 
 
as well as Singleton U’s observation in Martin v Dalzell that:
 
 
“The fact that the accident happened does not prove that the system ... used was an improper system. For some ten years or so it had been used without any accident. This was a most experienced man who was in charge of the operation. It was for him to decide how it should be done.”
 
 
Each accident must be evaluated on its facts, and taking all the circumstances into consideration, I find that the plaintiff had not made out his case against the defendants in negligence.”
 
19     Clearly, in deciding whether the duty imposed on an employer (to provide a competent staff of men; adequate material; and a proper system and effective supervision) has been discharged, each case must turn on its facts. We are not to “give undue weight to the fact that a distressing accident has happened”.
Employer’s statutory duties
20     Section 12(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (“the Act”) states that it shall be the duty of every employer to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work.
21     Section 12(3) of the Act provides that it shall be the duty of every employer to take general safety measures to ensure the safety and health of persons at work in the workplace.
22     Regulation 33 of the 
Workplace Safety and Health (Construction) Regulations 2007
 provides that it shall be the duty of the employer of any person who carries out any work in a worksite which requires any protection to provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, the appropriate personal protective equipment to the person.
Analysis and findings
Provision of safety googles 
23     It is the Plaintiff’s case that safety goggles were not issued or provided by the Defendant. The Defendant has thus failed to fulfil the duty of the employer by ensuring that adequate safety measures were taken in respect of the process of hammering the nail used by the Plaintiff.
[note: 13]
 The Plaintiff’s case appears to be based on the fact that the Defendants did not produce any documentary evidence to show that the workers were given eye goggles or were instructed to wear eye goggles for nailing work. The Plaintiff submitted that neither of the Defendant’s two witnesses produced in court any evidence to show that workers were told to wear safety goggles during work.
[note: 14]
24     The starting point of the analysis in respect of this issue is the evidence regarding the safety courses that the Plaintiff attended. The evidence showed that the Plaintiff had attended and passed two safety induction courses. He was taught in these courses that he must wear safety goggles to protect the eyes. The Plaintiff confirmed that he attended a safety orientation course in 2010 and another one in 2013 called “Construction Safety Orientation Course for Workers”. He confirmed that he had completed and passed the safety courses and agreed that he would not be allowed to work on site if he did not pass these courses.
[note: 15]
 He also said in court during cross-examination that he was told at the courses that workers must have with them at all times their personal protective equipment (“PPE”), including safety googles:
[note: 16]
 
Q: Now, I am also instructed that as part of this safety course, that all construction workers are briefed that they must have with them at all times on a construction site their personal protective equipment?
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
Q: And this includes safety googles to protect the eyes?
 
 
A: Yes
 
25     The Defendant’s case is that the Plaintiff was issued with a complete set of PPE
[note: 17]
 including a pair of safety goggles for his use at the worksite and that he was required to have the safety goggles with him at all times so that he can put the goggles on when necessary. He did not put them on because by his own case, he thought he was not required to wear them.
26     The Defendant’s counsel put the Defendant’s case to the Plaintiff during cross-examination. The Plaintiff was asked about the provision of the PPE to him. He initially said that he was given only the safety helmet, the safety vest and safely shoes.
[note: 18]
 Subsequently when pressed, he added that he was also given a safety belt.
[note: 19]
 Upon further cross-examination, he admitted that he was given protective googles when he needed to do certain work.
[note: 20]
 When pressed yet further by counsel he added that he was also given protective gloves.
[note: 21]
 At the end of the day, in the course of cross-examination, he agreed in essence that he had access to a set of PPE.
27     The Defendant’s case is that the safety goggles were issued to all workers including the Plaintiff shortly after the safety induction course. When the Plaintiff was cross-examined in this regard, he initially took the position that he was not issued with the safety googles but depending on the kind of work he had to perform, had to collect it himself:
[note: 22]
 
Q: I am also instructed that the safety googles were also given to each and every worker who has passed the safety orientation course?
 
 
A: No. It depends on what kind of work they will ask to handle. We will have to go and collect if from them. They did not issue it to us.
 
28     However after further cross-examination, he agreed that the safety goggles were light and easy to carry and that he was supposed to carry it with him on the worksite so that he could put it on when necessary:
[note: 23]
 
Q: Now, I’m instructed that because they are so light and so easy to carry, that you are supposed to carry it with you on the worksite such that in the event you are required to do any particular job which needs to protect the eyes that you can easily put on the safely goggles and do the work?
 
 
A: I agree.
 
29     Therefore by the Plaintiff’s own evidence he was trained on safety and the importance of the PPE. His evidence also shows that he was provided with a set of PPE, including safety googles.
30     As for the Defendant’s evidence, Marla Ganesh, the safety supervisor of the Plaintiff confirmed that the Plaintiff was given his full set of PPE.
[note: 24]
 He conducted daily safety briefings for the workers.
[note: 25]
 Chen ShiMing, the site supervisor of the Plaintiff had on the day of the accident instructed the Plaintiff and two other workers to use a metal sheet to cover the store roof area to prevent the area from getting wet when it rained. He told them not to nail directly on the timber but to use a drilling machine to drill holes first before nailing. He reminded them to wear safety googles to prevent injury in case of an accident.
[note: 26]
 It was when the Plaintiff was using a hammer to knock a nail through the corrugated metal sheet into a timber plank at the Site that the nail suddenly broke and a piece of it flew into his left eye.
31     All in all, in my assessment of the evidence, the Plaintiff was given a set of PPE, including safety googles. I therefore find that the Defendant had provided safety googles to the Plaintiff for use at the work site. The Plaintiff’s pleaded case against the Defendant was that he had not been provided or issued with safety goggles or proper PPE to carry out his work safely.
[note: 27]
 I find that the Plaintiff’s case is not supported by the evidence.
The Plaintiff choosing not to wear safety googles
32     The next question is whether the Plaintiff used safety googles when he was hammering the nail on the day of the accident. In the course of the trial the Plaintiff unexpectedly took a position that he did not 
need
 to wear safety googles when he was hammering the nail on 26 May 2013. This rather undercut his own case which was based on the assertion that the Defendant did not provide safety googles to him. The Plaintiff’s volte-face transpired when he was cross-examined:
[note: 28]
 
Q: Now, I am also instructed that as part of the safety orientation course that if you are to do hammering and nailing that you are taught that you must for safety wear safety goggles?
 
 
A: During the course we were told if you were to nail on a cement wall or we were to nail it on the metal pieces, we will need to put on the goggles. But we were not---but I was not told that I need to put on my goggles when I nail onto the wooden plank.
 
 
Q: Now Witness, earlier on when you described the work that you were doing, you mentioned to the Court that you were actually nailing or---or hammering or nail through a corrugated metal sheet onto a timber plank so this involves nailing through a metal work?
 
 
A: Yes
 
 
Q: So, you have been taught that then you would be required to wear safety goggles, correct?
 
 
A: I was nailing---I was hitting the nails not the iron nails--iron nails kind of thing.
 
 
Q: I don’t understand.
 
 
A: There’s a difference. Made of steel kind, is to hit on the cement, and hit onto the metal pipes. As for this kind of special materials, those normal nails are to hit on the wooden planks.
 
 
…
 
 
Q: So, based on your explanation to the Court just now about the different types of nail and the different types of nailing work, did this piece of work you were doing on a 23rd of May 2013 require you to wear safety goggles as what you were taught?
[note: 29]
 
 
A: During the course we were not told that we will need to put on the goggles when we need to hit the nail onto the wooden plank.
 
 
Q: So, is this your evidence that on the day in question 23rd of May 2013, that actually you were taught that you didn’t have to wear safety goggles for that type of work?
 
 
A: Yes, because nobody will---will he putting on their goggles when they do the same kind of work.
 
 
…
 
 
Q: Witness, can you just inform the Court what is that person with the hammer? What is he nailing into? [Plaintiff was shown a photograph found at p13 of his AEIC]
[note: 30]
 
 
A: It’s a nail.
 
 
Q: And what is the nail being hammered into?
 
 
A: In the wooden plank
 
 
Q: Now, earlier in your evidence you had informed the Court that in your safety orientation courses, you were taught that if you were hammering a nail into wood, that actually there is no need to wear a safety goggles, is that correct?
 
 
A: It was not mentioned. It was only mentioned that if you were to nail it to the cement or you nail it to the steel pipe, then you need to put on the googles.
 
 
Q: Yah, but we have established just now I think repeatedly from you that when you actually hammered a nail into the corrugated metal panel and then into the wood that actually there was no requirement to wear safely goggles and that’s what you have said before lunch. Can you please confirm that?
 
 
A: Yes, I said that.
 
 
…
 
 
Q: Okay. Now, just to confirm, on the 26th of May 2013, you were not using steel nails, correct?
[note: 31]
 
 
A. It’s – it’s just normal nails.
 
 
Q: Okay.
 
 
A: Metal nails.
 
 
Q: Yah. So based on your evidence when you are nailing normal nails and not steel nails, then you actually do not need to wear safely goggles, correct?
 
 
A: According to my understanding and during the training, I think I do not need to put on the goggles for doing so.
 
 
…
 
 
Q: Well, you see, Witness, you actually referred to this photograph by---using this photograph to say that these workers were supposed to be wearing safety goggles but they were not, that is what you are saying in your Evidence-in-Chief?
 
 
A: The worker in the picture holding the hammer, he was actually skilled in---he was actually skilled in carpentry works. So, when I saw that for them doing carpentry work, who are skilled in carpentry work need not put on the goggles. And so for me who are doing the tiling work, so I felt that I need not put on the goggles as well.
 
 
Q: Okay so witness, you are -- in other words, you are saying that the photograph in--at---in page 13 is to show that since the person holding a na---the---the hammer is skilled in carpentry work does not need to wear goggles. So even more so for you who are not skilled in carpentry work also need not wear safety goggles, correct?
 
 
A: Yes, because during the training, I was not told that I need to put on the goggles while hitting nails into wooden planks.
 
33     As seen, the Plaintiff’s position taken in court is that he was not required to wear safety goggles for the type of work that he was doing on 26 May 2013. With that being the case, it is hard put for the Plaintiff to say that the Defendant was at fault for his injury by not providing him with goggles.
34     I find that the evidence in fact showed that the Defendant had provided the Plaintiff with a safe system of work and taken all reasonable steps to ensure the system was adhered to by providing safety goggles, conducting safety courses and conducting daily safety checks on the construction site. The Defendant had fulfilled its duties under the law to provide a safe system of work for the Defendant. The Plaintiff had chosen not to wear the safety goggles; and in so doing, has only himself to blame for the injury.
35     The evidence examined up to this point is sufficient for me to make a finding that the Plaintiff had failed, on a balance of probability, to prove his case against the Defendant. For completeness however, I will also deal with the other two aspects of the case.
Pre-existing Eye Injury
36     This is an aspect of the case revealed in evidence that ought to be highlighted. The evidence shows that the Plaintiff in fact had a pre-existing eye condition that had nothing to do with the injury suffered on 26 May 2013.
37     As alluded to above, at the medical review on 5 June 2013 the doctor found that the hyphaema caused by the accident had completely resolved and the cornea was clear. The Plaintiff then had a discussion with the doctor about his pre-existing condition of aphakia. After the discussion, the Plaintiff indicated to the doctor an interest in having a secondary lens implant for his pre-existing condition. In other words, it was the Plaintiff who wanted to go for the secondary lens implant to treat his pre-existing injury of aphakia.
38     The said surgery for secondary lens implant to rectify his pre-existing condition was carried out on 14 May 2014. His post-surgery recovery was uneventful.
[note: 32]
 As noted above, the Defendant paid for the secondary lens implant surgery.
39     Clearly, the secondary lens implant was not to treat the eye injury as the left corneal abrasion was completely healed by 27 May 2013 and the hyphaema had completely resolved by 5 June 2013. The purpose of the lens implant was to treat the Plaintiffs eye condition which had been pre-existing for 25 years. However, if one looks at the pleadings and the AEIC of the Plaintiff, on would not know this. No mention was made that the Plaintiff had a pre-existing condition in the eye. In fact, in the statement of claim filed on behalf of the Plaintiff, it was stated that he had a “serious” injury in the eye as a result of the accident. It is clear however from the Medical Report that his injury was described as a “superficial corneal abrasion” or a “microscopic hyphaema”. In the Plaintiff’s AEIC, the pre-existing eye condition was not highlighted. It was also not highlighted that the surgery that the Plaintiff had undergone after the accident was to correct his pre-existing condition. Instead, the Plaintiff simply exhibited the Medical Report. One has to examine the Medical Report to discern that the Plaintiff had a pre-existing eye condition. The pre-existing condition was also in the same eye where the Plaintiff had suffered the superficial injury from the accident. In fact, in comparison, the pre-existing condition, where the lens was missing, was plainly a very much more serious condition. It would seem from the way the Plaintiff had presented his pleadings and his AEIC that he had deliberately conflated the superficial injury he suffered and his pre-existing condition. He was taking advantage of the coincidence of the pre-existing eye injury been on the same eye as the one that suffered the superficial injury from the accident.
40     When the Plaintiff was confronted in court with the Medical Report showing that he had a pre-existing condition, he continued to attempt to cloud the medical issue. During cross-examination by Defendant’s counsel Mr Raymond Lye:
[note: 33]
 
 
Q.
 
 
 
 
Yah. And can you also confirm for the Court that your left eye you actually had no lens in your left eye since--- okay, for a period of 25 years before 2014, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
A.
 
 
 
 
I don’t.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Now, what was your eyesight in your left eye during this period when you had no lens?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
When I was young I injured my eye before but it has no effect—it-
 
 
 
 
Interpreter:
 
 
 
 
Sorry---
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Does not affect my eyesight.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Is he telling the Court that even though he had no lens in his left eye that it never affected his---his left eye---left eye’s vision at all?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
No, Your Honour, because when I went to take my driving license test I need---they need to test my eyesight.
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Now at this point I just want to re---refer him to his Affidavit of Evidence-in-chief at page 8. It’s a medical report.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Now, can he please explain to the Court how come the doctor who saw him and came up with the report has written this down in the medical report?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Well, that was because after the doctor has inspected me, he asked me whether I had injured my eye before. And I replied “Yes”. He asked me whether I can see now and I say “No”. He---he asked me how about in the past, and my left eye vision is slightly lower than my right eye vision about 0.2. Before I came to Singapore I also went for a medical examination. I also have a report.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
So, do you have any explanation as to why the—-the doctor would have said that you had poor vision for the last 25 years? In his left eye.
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
This could be some language harrier in understanding. I---initial---initially a doctor spoke to me in English. English. Subsequently another doctor spoke to me in Mandarin. And the later part was interpreted to me so there could be some mistakes in the interpretation.
 
 
41     Confronted with the Medical Report, the Plaintiff then tried to make light of the effect of his pre-existing condition, in a bid to exaggerate the seriousness of the injury that resulted from the accident. He even went to the extent of asserting that his eye sight was not affected by the lack of a lens. This was contrary to the Medical Report, which stated that he had poor vision as a result of the pre-existing condition.
[note: 34]
 As seen above, when referred to this statement in the Medical Report, he blamed it on the language barrier and mistakes in interpretation when he spoke to the doctor. In other words, his position was that the doctor from SNEC was wrong about his having poor vision as a result of aphakia.
42     It should also be mentioned that Chen ShiMing the site supervisor who on the day of the accident had instructed the Plaintiff to use a metal sheet to cover the store roof area was the Plaintiff’s old neighbour in China. This was not disputed by the Plaintiff.
[note: 35]
 Chen ShiMing gave evidence that he knew of the Plaintiff’s pre-existing eye injury, which he had sustained when he was a child.
[note: 36]
43     As alluded to above, the Defendant paid about $9,000 for the surgery to rectify the Plaintiff’s pre-existing condition. The Defendant also paid a goodwill sum of $1,500 to the Plaintiff when he wanted to stop work and return home. These payments were not disputed by the Plaintiff.
[note: 37]
 Together with some excess salary paid to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had expended an amount about $13,000. The Defendant submits that if any sum of damages is awarded for the Plaintiff’s very minor injury, it should be set off against the sum of $13,000 expended by the Defendant.
Plaintiff was able to carry out work that was more difficult after the accident
44     I move to the last aspect of the evidence. After the accident, and up to the day of the secondary lens implant surgery (from 3 June 2013 to 13 May 2014), the Plaintiff continued to work for the Defendant and with no changes to his work scope. The Plaintiff’s inconsistent testimony continued when he was cross-examined on this. He was asked about the type of work that he was able to do before and after the accident. During cross-examination:
[note: 38]
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Am I correct to say that you are doing hauling work as a renovation worker?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Yes, less tedious
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Alright, when he says “Less tedious” what does he mean?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Those that require more things to be done, I am not able to do so.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Alright, can we be more precise? What is he talking about? “More things to be done that he can’t do”?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
If the tiles will be put on the ground or on the wall and --- and it‘s supposed to be upright, I could do so but however if it‘s going to be more complex, then I am not able to do so. I need to have good eyesight. If not then I will not be able to do that.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Can he elaborate what does he mean by ‘Good eyesight” when he needs good eyesight?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
In the past when I do such work, when there’s a gap between 2 tiles I am able to see it with my eyes and I am able to see whether they are properly done hut now there’s a blind spot for me.
 
 
45     Later in the evidence, he said he did more complex work 
after
 the accident:
[note: 39]
 
Q: Now, witness, just confirm for His Honour that the –the nature of the work you did in this period after the 26th of May and the work that you did before the 26th of May was the same?
 
 
A: Yes, but more complex.
 
 
Q: Okay. So after the accident he was – he was actually doing more complex work?
 
 
A: Yes.
 
46     When the Plaintiff was confronted with the discrepancy in his evidence, he shifted his position again:
[note: 40]
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Now, Witness, you have mentioned that you had an eye problem and that you wanted to go for further eye treatment and you mentioned this to “Chen Shi Ming?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Now, how it is possible that after the accident for one whole year, you could do more complex work and there was no complaint about your work at all?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Because the work that I did after the accident was more of a manual job. And my job also was just to assist carpentry work or the metal works.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
You see, Witness, I get the impression that you are changing your evidence along the way. Now, why do I say this, can just ---can you just explain [inaudible]?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
No, there’s no change.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Now, on this point you - we have clearly established from your answer that the nature of the work you did before and after the 26
th
 of May 2013 was the same. Your -- that was your own answer?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Before the accident, I was also doing cementing work and also some carpentry work. After the accident, I followed other workers to do metal work. I did whatever that as assigned to me by my supervisor.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
You see, Witness, in fact not only did you say that the nature of the work you did before and after the alleged accident was the same. You even said that the work you did after the accident was more complex. And therefore the one whole year after there were no complaints about the quality of the work. So why is it now, you know, to my further question you are informing His Honour that after the accident, the type of work you did is different, in fact now it becomes more manual. That is changing your evidence right?
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Yes, Your Honour, I’ll break it up. Now, you see, Witness, you mentioned to His Honour that the nature of the work you did before and after the 26” of May was the same. And?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
About the .came.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Okay. Now, it has the “about”.
 
 
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Okay, I’ll accept that. Then later on he said in fact after the accident, he did more complex work?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Then he confirmed that for the 1 year after the 26
th
 of May 2013 right? There were no complaints about the quality of his work?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
Lye:
 
 
 
 
Now, if he can say all these 3 things. why is it now --- he --- he is trying to tell His Honour that in fact the work that he’s doing after the 26
th
 of May is somehow more manual and less complex. Am I correct?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
They are manual work. It’s just like moulding work and metal work. For the Bangladeshi workers they do not have much training, they are also doing it. Someone will lead them and they just follow what the 1
st
 person was doing. And I followed behind them, assist them in whatever ways.
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
 
 
Well, just following on from your answer, so for this period in the — for the work nature that you just describe, do you have to use your eye sight?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
47     Plainly, the Plaintiff was trying to fudge the state of his vision and ability to do the work before and after the accident. He would not have been able to work for one year without getting any complaints if he had problems with his vision. Further, by his own admission, the Plaintiff was in fact doing work that was more complex after the accident.
Conclusion 
48     The Plaintiff’s case is that safety googles were not issued or provided by the Defendant; and the Defendant has thus failed to fulfil the duty of the employer by ensuring that adequate safety measures were taken in respect of the process of hammering the nail used by the Plaintiff.
[note: 41]
 The evidence however, shows that safety googles were provided. I also find that the Defendant had provided the Plaintiff with a safe system of work and had taken all reasonable steps to ensure the system was adhered to by providing safety goggles, conducting safety courses and conducting daily safety checks on the construction site. The Defendant had therefore fulfilled its duties under the law to provide a safe system of work for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff in choosing not to wear the safety goggles has himself to blame for the injury.
49     As alluded to above, in deciding whether the duty imposed on an employer (to provide a competent staff of men; adequate material; and a proper system and effective supervision) has been discharged, each case must turn on its facts. From the facts of this case, I find that the Defendant has discharged their duty. The Plaintiff had failed, on a balance of probability, to prove his case against the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s case is hereby dismissed. I will hear parties on costs.
50     As noted in the first paragraph of this judgment, not every injured worker is the hapless victim of an employer’s oversight. In this case, I have made a finding that the Defendant had taken the necessary measures required by law to ensure the safety of their workers. However, what I find troubling about this case is that the Plaintiff had decided to lay a claim for damages against the Defendant for suffering a very minor injury that resulted from his own doing. The Plaintiff made the claim one and a half years after suffering the injury. In the interim, he continued working for the Defendant for almost a year, doing work of the same nature. The Defendant had not only paid for all of the Plaintiff’s medical expenses relating to the injury, they had also paid a further sum of $9,000 for an operation to rectify an eye condition of his that had pre-existed for 25 years. The Defendant then paid the Plaintiff a goodwill sum of $1,500 and the costs of the air ticket when he said he wanted to go home to China after the operation; only to have him returned to Singapore to commence a claim against them.
51     I find the Plaintiff’s conduct wholly opportunistic. Whilst employers have a duty to safeguard the safety and well-being of their workers, it does not follow that the employer is negligent every time an accident occurs at the workplace. The corollary of this is that it does not follow that every time a worker is injured, he should make a claim against his employer. Such a litigious approach should not be encouraged among workers in Singapore; and it is imperative that all stakeholders concerned take responsibility to prevent such a culture from emerging.

Introduction
1       This was an appeal brought by the Appellant, a youthful offender against his global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane imposed upon the Appellant’s plea of guilt (see the District Judge’s grounds of decision reported at 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Zuhairie Adely Bin Zulkifli
 [2015] SGDC 359 (the “GD”)). The main issue central to the appeal was whether reformative training or imprisonment and caning was the appropriate sentence. The prioritisation of the primary sentencing considerations engaged was thus a matter contested.
2       After considering the submissions of the parties and the precedent cases, I was of the view that reformative training was the much more appropriate sentence that achieved the twin sentencing objectives of deterrence and rehabilitation. Although the Appellant’s offences were serious and did attract some level of public disquiet and outrage, this was not a case that was so heinous such that the statutory prescribed punishment should be imposed, especially after considering the Appellant’s unfortunate circumstances and positive reformative prospects.
3       I allowed the appeal, and ordered the Appellant’s sentence of imprisonment and caning to be substituted with a sentence of reformative training.
Background
The Appellant’s background
4       The Appellant was a first-time youthful offender prior to his conviction in the proceedings below, and was 17 years of age at the time of the appeal. He was a student of NorthLight School from 2011 to 2014 with regular overall attendance and generally good overall conduct, academic performance and co-curricular activities participation. He had a perfect score of 4.0 for his Grade Point Average and received several school awards. Upon completion of his course at NorthLight School, he enrolled into the Institute of Technical Education College West (“ITE College West”) in January 2014. He was reported to exhibit very regular attendance and good academic performance at ITE College West as well.
[note: 1]
 These were achieved notwithstanding the Appellant’s unfortunate family background that was characterised by financial difficulties, a lack of effective parental care, and negative parental role-modelling that included repeated incarceration, unemployment, domestic violence and substance abuse.
[note: 2]
5       Due to the high-risk family background and lack of proper adult supervision and care, the Appellant was admitted into the Salvation Army Gracehaven on 20 January 2011 for his care and protection.
[note: 3]
 On 21 January 2011, an interim Care and Protection Order was made under the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”) for the Appellant to be admitted into the Singapore Boys’ Home for three months. Thereafter, he was ordered to be placed under the care of his maternal aunt for one year, while under the statutory supervision of an approved welfare officer. This placement broke down and the Appellant was ordered to reside at the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home (“MWH”) on 30 March 2012. Since then, the Appellant had been resident at MWH with the initial Care and Protection Order extended twice as his parents were assessed to be still unable to provide and care for him. Due to the offences that he faced, the Appellant was expelled from ITE in March 2015. Upon the lapse of the order in August 2015, the Appellant voluntarily extended his stay in MWH to complete his “N” Level examinations as a private candidate.
[note: 4]
The offences and the circumstances under which they were committed
6       On 31 March 2014, while still resident at MWH under an extended Care and Protection order under s 49(1)(
c
) of the CYPA, the Appellant failed to return to MWH after his school’s Industrial Attachment Programme at Bukit Merah.
[note: 5]
7       After having escaped from the lawful custody of MWH, the Appellant (then aged 15) at or about midnight on 20 April 2014 with five of his friends (including one Rizqi) met at East Coast Park.
[note: 6]
 Rizqi’s girlfriend, one Eka, was also present. Eka had walked away to meet one of her male friends, one Norazrul. When Eka did not return after some time, the Appellant and Rizqi went to search for her. Rizqi discovered that Eka had spent time alone with Norazrul and was displeased. The Appellant and his five friends then confronted the Norazrul. Rizqi who was shirtless then identified himself as Eka’s boyfriend and indicated that he was from a gang. Without warning, the Appellant punched Norazrul on the left cheek, and thereafter the other five friends joined in to kick and punch him as well, continuing to do so even after Norazrul had fallen down. Norazrul eventually managed to get up and escape when he ran to a nearby barbeque pit where a family was having a barbeque and an unknown passer-by yelled for them to stop assaulting Norazrul. Norazrul then called for police assistance but declined to be treated for his injuries, which included swelling on the left cheek and multiple bruises and abrasions all over his body.
8       Subsequently, the Appellant returned to MWH on 25 April 2014, and continued residing there. Sometime in the evening of 7 March 2015, the Appellant (then aged 16, already enrolled in ITE College West) was in the Clarke Quay area when he chanced upon a fellow female ITE College West student Norhalizah Bte Abdul Wahab (“Norhalizah”) who was walking around in the area with her boyfriend Ahmad Nurthaqif Bin Sahed (“Ahmad”), a graduate of ITE College West. The Appellant shouted out “baby” to Norhalizah and the two of them had a brief conversation. Subsequently, when Norhalizah went to the restroom, Ahmad confronted the Appellant and communicated his displeasure at the Appellant calling Norhalizah “baby”. The Appellant claimed that this nickname was used by Norhalizah over the years with her peers, including him, without any romantic meaning. He had known her since he was at NorthLight School.
[note: 7]
9       Over the next few days from 7 to 10 March 2015, the Appellant sent text messages to Norhalizah and informed her that he wished to meet Ahmad to “talk things out with him”. Norhalizah replied that Ahmad was not free to do so.
10     On 9 March 2015, the Appellant carried a bread knife (with a 35-centimetre-long blade) to school. He claimed to be preoccupied with thoughts of getting even with the victim, as he perceived Ahmad to be unfair and dismissive. The Appellant kept the bread knife in his school locker.
11     On 10 March 2015, Norhalizah went to ITE College West at 12.30 p.m. to meet Ahmad. Classes were in session and there were other students and teachers present. While Ahmad was walking around the campus, the Appellant spotted him and confronted him, stating that he was unhappy with him. Thereafter, the Appellant took the bread knife from his locker. The Appellant later spotted Ahmad at the open-air meeting area in the ITE College West campus known as the “Piazza”. Ahmad was sitting down in the Piazza with Norhalizah and some other friends. At the material time, there were more than 50 other persons at the Piazza, most of whom were fellow students. The Appellant admitted that he had brought the knife along so that Ahmad would be fearful of him; however he felt that Ahmad had tested his limits and he decided to use the knife to slash him. The Appellant attributed arming himself with a weapon to his perceived intimidation from Ahmad and his larger build, as well as an alleged assault by Ahmad in Clarke Quay on 7 March (the Appellant claimed Ahmad kicked him on his chest), and his presumed need to confront Ahmad without injuring himself.
[note: 8]
12     He charged at Ahmad from behind, slashed him once, and Ahmad immediately ran to the centre of the Piazza with the Appellant in pursuit. Ahmad then kicked the Appellant in defence. The Appellant fell to the ground, got back up and swung the knife repeatedly at Ahmad’s face. Ahmad thus used his hands to protect his face and was slashed on his hands. Ahmad eventually managed to escape from the scene, with the Appellant remaining in the middle of the Piazza. The Appellant then paced about for some time before a friend came up to him and removed the knife from his hands. He then fled from the scene, but was arrested later that day at his grandmother’s residence.
13     ITE staff rendered first aid to the Ahmad. Ahmad was later conveyed to and admitted to National University Hospital for two days. After being deemed fit for discharge, he was given three months of medical leave. According to his medical report, he suffered from fractures on his forearm, ringer finger, little finger, was cut behind his left ear and had a two-centimetre laceration on his upper back.
The proceedings and decision below
14     In the proceedings below, the Appellant pleaded guilty to two separate charges under ss 326 and 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “grievous hurt offence” and “rioting offence”, respectively) on 16 October 2015:
 
DAC 908497/2015 (the grievous hurt offence)
 
… [T]hat you, on 10 March 2015, at or about 12.30pm, at 1 Choa Chu Kang Grove, ITE College West, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one namely Ahmad Nurthaqif Bin Sahed, by means of a bread knife with a blade measuring 35cm in length, which when used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, to wit, by using the said bread knife to slash the said Ahmad Nurthaqif Bin Sahed repeatedly on his body, causing the following injuries:
a)    Left ulna fracture;
b)    Left ring finger fracture;
c)    Left little finger fracture;
and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
DAC 915833/2015 (the rioting offence)
 
… [T]hat you, on the 20
th
 day of April 2014, at or about 2.28 am, at Xtreme SkatePark @ East Coast, along East Coast Park Service Road, Singapore, together with:-
(i)    [K], Male/15 years
(ii)   [L], Male/14 years
(iii)   Rizqi Andika Bin Azmi, Male/16 years
(iv)   [M], Male/15 years
(v)    [N], Male/15 years
were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to one Norazrul Bin Mohd Noor, and in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly, one or more of you used violence on the said Norazrul Bin Mohd Noor, to wit, by punching and kicking him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
15     A charge of escaping from the legal custody of MWH (see above at [6]) under s 225B of the Penal Code was also taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The District Judge then called for pre-sentence probation and reformative training reports while the Appellant was being remanded.
16     On 25 November 2015, the District Judge sentenced the Appellant to 18 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the grievous hurt offence, and six months’ imprisonment for the rioting offence. He ordered both sentences to run concurrently, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
17     As to why imprisonment was imposed and not reformative training, the District Judge had agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that in view of the seriousness of the grievous hurt offence, rehabilitation as the usual dominant sentencing consideration in dealing with youthful offenders had to give way to deterrence. He held that the grievous hurt offence committed in broad daylight in full view of students and teachers on campus was “egregious and particular heinous”, involved a degree of premeditation, and the victim had suffered serious injuries that indicated the ferocity of the attack. He was also of the opinion that the offence was a violent one that caused alarm to members of the public (see [19]–[27] of the GD).
18     Upon the Appellant’s filing of his Notice of Appeal on 26 November 2015, the District Judge granted a stay of execution of the Appellant’s sentence on 30 November 2015.
The appeal
19     In his appeal, the Appellant sought for a substitution of the order of imprisonment and caning with an order for reformative training on the basis that:
(a)     the District Judge’s sentence of imprisonment and caning was manifestly excessive as rehabilitation should still be the predominant sentencing consideration;
(b)     the offences the Appellant committed were not as serious as the District Judge had thought them to be;
(c)     even if they were, the offences committed were 
not so serious
 that rehabilitation was displaced by deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration;
(d)     the Appellant’s “strong potential for reform” was given insufficient or no weight in deciding the most appropriate sentence; and
(e)     reformative training was the most appropriate sentence with reformation as a priority with the attendant element of incarceration carrying a significant deterrent effect.
20     In response, the Prosecution submitted that:
(a)     the District Judge had properly appreciated both the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case and had rightly come to the conclusion that the grievous hurt offence was a particularly serious offence;
(b)     the District Judge had correctly appreciated that deterrence took precedence over rehabilitation in the present case as (i) the grievous hurt offence was a particularly heinous one, (ii) the Appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation should not be overstated; and (iii) young offenders had been sentenced to imprisonment and caning in circumstances of equal or lesser gravity; and
(c)     the sentence that was meted out by the District Judge was appropriate in all circumstances.
Sentencing of youthful offenders: principles
21     In 
Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz
 
[2016] 1 SLR 334
 (“
Boaz
”) at [28], Sundaresh Menon CJ, citing 
Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449
 (“
Al-Ansari
”), described the well-established two-staged approach for a court sentencing a youthful offender as follows:
At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to 
identify
 and 
prioritise
 the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to 
select the appropriate sentence
 that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones. [emphasis added]
First step: identification and prioritisation of sentencing considerations
22     In the first stage, the inquiry is concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. It is trite that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration when dealing with youthful offenders (see 
Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 439
 (“
Maurice Mok
”) at [21], 
per
 Yong Pung How CJ), as young offenders are in their formative years and the chances for successful rehabilitation are better. Compassion is thus shown to them on the basis that the young “don’t know any better”, and to keep them away from the “corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation”.
23     Nonetheless, rehabilitation can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution in appropriate situations where, as Menon CJ pointed in 
Boaz
 at [30] (the “
Boaz
 factors”):
(a)     the offence is serious;
(b)     the harm caused is severe;
(c)     the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; or
(d)     the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.
24     In striking the balance between the 
dominant
 consideration of rehabilitation and the need for deterrence, V K Rajah JA (as he then was) in 
Al-Ansari
 at [67] suggested the following relevant factors:
(a)     the seriousness of the offence;
(b)     the culpability of the offender;
(c)     the existence of antecedents;
(d)     the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender;
(e)     the availability of familial support in the rehabilitative efforts; and
(f)     any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.
25     I would venture to suggest that these six non-exhaustive factors in 
Al-Ansari
 had been distilled to the four listed subsequently in 
Boaz
 (see above at [23]), with the last three broadly equivalent to whether rehabilitative sentencing options are viable for the particular youthful offender. The fourth factor relating to the nature of rehabilitation best suited for the offender arguably jumps the gun to a certain extent. But from the discussion at [74]–[75] of 
Al-Ansari
, it would seem Rajah JA had in fact meant to refer to the viability and suitability of rehabilitative options 
in general
. Only upon identifying that rehabilitation remained a dominant sentencing consideration would a deeper analysis of the nature of rehabilitation best suited for the offender be engaged in the second step of the analytical framework where the court would decide on the most appropriate sentence that gives effect to the proper balance between rehabilitation and deterrence in the particular case. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not mean that the 
Boaz
 factors are irrelevant in the second stage. The court would still have to keep those factors in mind while deciding on the most appropriate sentence.
26     I should also state that it is not necessary for 
all
 the 
Boaz
 factors to be present for a court to hold that rehabilitation has been displaced as the primary sentencing consideration. However, if the offence is so serious 
and
 the young offender has no or very low rehabilitative prospects, then deterrence and/or punishment (in the form of imprisonment) would likely displace rehabilitation as the dominant consideration (see 
Al-Ansari
 at [61]).
27     Hence, as the Prosecution submitted
[note: 9]
 and I had agreed, it was not necessary that a youthful offender was incapable of reform before the sentencing considerations such as deterrence and/or retribution could come to the fore and eclipse rehabilitation. The converse should then also hold true: that the absence of any 
one
 or more of the 
Boaz
 factors would not always lead to the conclusion that the rehabilitation should retain its primacy in the sentencing matrix. Hence, just merely because a rehabilitation sentencing option such as reformative training is 
viable
 would not mean that the court would inexorably grant a sentence of reformative training. However, if a youthful offender’s reformative prospects are demonstrably good, the court should bear this in mind and lean in favour of rehabilitation when balancing the relevant sentencing considerations in the sentencing process.
28     After all, in situations where probation was considered in the sentencing of youthful offenders, it has been held that in cases where the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is “demonstrably high”, this “germane” factor could outweigh public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against 
probation
 (see 
Public Prosecutor v Justin Heng Zheng Hao
 
[2012] SGDC 219
 at [13], as affirmed by Menon CJ in 
Public Prosecutor v Adith s/o Sarvotham
 
[2014] 3 SLR 649
 (“
Adith
”) at [14] and Chao Hick Tin JA in 
Leon Russel Francis v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] 4 SLR 651
 (“
Leon Russel Francis
”) at [14]). Arguably then, a case for 
reformative training
 would require something 
less
 stringent than the standard of “demonstrably high” for a case of probation in terms of the youthful offender’s capacity or potential for rehabilitation. In 
Adith
, Menon CJ held that the respondent’s capacity for rehabilitation was not so demonstrably high that a term of probation was sufficient, and instead felt that a sentence of reformative training would have been more appropriate.
29     Thus, in situations where a youthful offender’s rehabilitative prospects are good, rehabilitation may not be outweighed by the need for deterrence despite the gravity of the offence committed by the youthful offender. The courts have therefore held that rehabilitation still remained a dominant sentencing consideration and imposed either probation or reformative training, even when serious offences such as drug-related offences (see 
Adith
 and 
Leon Russel Francis
), mischief by fire and harassment of debtors of unlicensed moneylenders (see 
Nur Azilah bte Ithnin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2010] 4 SLR 731
 (“
Nur Azilah
”)), armed robbery on a public bus (see 
Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Fareez Bin Rahmat
 
[2010] SGDC 99
) and causing hurt by dangerous weapons (see 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Bahri Anwar Bin Mohamed Rani
 
[2008] SGDC 235
, which like in the present case involved injuries arising from the use of knives in broad daylight in a public place) were committed by youthful offenders.
30     In the light of this, apart from a consideration of the 
Boaz
 factors, it would still be necessary to consider 
all
 the relevant facts and circumstances which ultimately aid the court in achieving the right balance between deterrence and rehabilitation when sentencing a young offender. In the delicate balancing exercise, one of the key considerations would in my view be 
the rehabilitative potential of the young offender
.
Second step: selection of the appropriate sentence
31     In the present appeal, the sentences in contest were between on the one hand imprisonment and caning, and on the other reformative training. Reformative training would substitute 
both
 imprisonment and caning: see 
Ng Kwok Fai v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 1 SLR(R) 193
 at [7]; and also Kow Keng Siong, 
Sentencing Principles in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2009) at pp 1020–1022. While reformative training offers the court a “middle ground” that incorporates both elements of rehabilitation and deterrence (see 
Boaz
 at [36]–[38]; as well as 
Al-Ansari
 at [57]–[58]), imprisonment would only be appropriate for youthful offenders when rehabilitation has been so overshadowed by deterrence as a dominant sentencing consideration. After all, there is public interest in both ensuring that young offenders are rehabilitated (see 
Maurice Mok
 at [23], citing 
R v Smith
 [1964] Crim LR 70) and in giving effect to both general and specific deterrence. Thus, the fulcrum between them would have to be placed such that the sentencing considerations are balanced appropriately.
32     In 
Al-Ansari
 at [61], Rajah JA recognised that imprisonment would be appropriate in “dire situations” where both the offence(s) was heinous 
and
 the young offender was not suitable for rehabilitative sentencing options:
If the offence is so heinous 
and
 the young offender so devoid of any realistic prospect of being reformed then deterrence must form the 
dominant
 consideration, 
and the statutorily prescribed punishment (probably imprisonment) for the offender would be the obvious choice
. I should add that even in such dire situations, the rehabilitation of the offender has not been cast aside; indeed, the present prison environment (assuming imprisonment is ordered) does provide some form of rehabilitation as well. It is, however, not tailor-made for young offenders unlike reformative training that is implemented in a special facility. [emphasis in bold added]
33     There is still, however, a “measure of rehabilitation” even if imprisonment is imposed on youthful offenders, as the Prosecution rightly submitted.
[note: 10]
 As noted in 
Boaz
 at [34], when a court determines that rehabilitation remains a primary consideration, the court can consider one from among the whole gamut of sentencing options at its disposal, such as community-based rehabilitation, probation, placement in a juvenile rehabilitation centre, reformative training, fines, caning and 
imprisonment
.
My decision
34     It is established that an appellate court can interfere in a sentence in the following circumstances (see 
Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684
 at [14]) where the sentencing judge:
(a)     made the wrong decision as to the proper factual matrix for the sentence;
(b)     erred in appreciating the material before him;
(c)     erred in principle in pronouncing the sentence that he did; or
(d)     imposed a manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate sentence.
35     The Appellant’s argument in this appeal was that the sentence of imprisonment and caning was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive and that a sentence of reformative training should have been imposed instead.
Rehabilitation diminished but not eclipsed in the sentencing matrix
36     The focus in the proceedings below and in the submissions of the appeal before me was largely on the grievous hurt offence. To a certain extent, I recognised that the grievous hurt offence was apparently more serious than the rioting offence, and was the one that attracted public attention as well, due to the attack occurring in broad daylight in a school campus and the fact that many video clips of the incident were circulating on the Internet. However, the principled approach in sentencing youthful offenders would be to first consider the 
Boaz
 factors with regard to 
all
 the offences committed by the youthful offender in totality, and not merely focus on only the seemingly most serious of them. Although the “offence” in the 
Boaz
 factors listed by Menon CJ (and for that matter, in the factors listed in 
Al-Ansari
 too) was phrased in singular terms (see above at [23]–[24]), Menon CJ clearly meant for the inquiry to contemplate 
all
 offences committed. This was evident from his discussion of past examples where rehabilitation yielded its usual primacy in the sentencing of youthful offenders. He cited 
Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman
 
[2003] 4 SLR(R) 281
 at [31] of 
Boaz
 as a “clear example of a case where the 
offences
 were sufficiently serious and the actions of the offender were sufficiently outrageous that rehabilitation had to yield to other sentencing considerations” (emphasis added). In his discussion of his unreported 
ex tempore
 decision in 
Long Yan v Public Prosecutor
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 9015 of 2015 (16 July 2015) at [33] of 
Boaz
 as well, he pointed out that he had noted the gravity of the “offences” and the harm caused.
37     Thus, I considered the four 
Boaz
 factors with regard to the Appellant’s offences and circumstances and reached the conclusion that rehabilitation still retained its importance in the sentencing matrix, despite being diminished by the need for deterrence due to the seriousness of the offences and the harm caused. Courts will usually, though not inexorably, place rehabilitation at the forefront of sentencing considerations when it comes to youthful offenders: see 
Maurice Mok
 at [21] and [25]. In the present case, I was of the view that the principle of deterrence assumed a great importance, but not to the extent of eclipsing that of rehabilitation.
Gravity of the offences and harm caused
38     I agreed with the District Judge’s conclusion that the offences committed by the Appellant, especially the grievous hurt offence, necessitated that imposition of a 
deterrent
 sentence. For the grievous hurt offence, general deterrence - to educate members of the public and deter like-minded persons from acting similarly - assumed great significance due to the fact that public disquiet was occasioned when the attack occurred in broad daylight in a school campus. It was indeed an “audacious display of such stark violence” at an institution of learning (see GD at [19]). Specific deterrence was also relevant since the grievous hurt offence had involved some degree of premeditation, which the District Judge had rightly appreciated (see GD at [21]). The Appellant admitted that he had intended to use the knife on the victim and had kept it in his locker for use against the victim. As for the rioting offence, it was serious in itself with it being a group offence where the Appellant and five others had confronted and attacked an innocent victim while he was 
outnumbered
 in a 
public place
 at East Coast. Some element of general deterrence would be relevant.
Considering past cases where imprisonment was imposed
39     In response to the Appellant’s comparison of the present case to that in 
Al-Ansari
 where the accused’s sentence of probation was substituted with a sentence of reformative training upon appeal, the Prosecution submitted that “it would not be fruitful to compare every single case where reformative training [had] been ordered to determine whether this particular case was grave or otherwise” and that each case turns on its own facts.
[note: 11]
 In 
Al-Ansari
, a 16-year-old youthful offender was sentenced to reformative training on appeal after pleading guilty to one count of robbery at night under s 392 (read with s 34) of the Penal Code. Rajah JA noted that despite the “need for a higher level of deterrence” (at [86]) due to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of planning and deliberation, rehabilitation still remained “a valid and vital consideration to be taken into account” (at [81]) when balancing the sentencing considerations, due to the offender’s young age, the fact that he had no antecedents, and the overall seriousness of the offence when juxtaposed against more serious cases.
40     Yet in its own submissions, the Prosecution ironically pointed out three cases which had circumstances of allegedly “equal or lesser gravity” than the present case and where imprisonment had been imposed on young offenders: 
Public Prosecutor v Al-Fazli bin Amir Ali
 Magistrate’s Appeal 122 of 2000/01 (“
Al-Fazli
”), 
Thulasidas s/o Sahadevan v Public Prosecutor
 Magistrate’s Appeal 105 of 2001 (“
Thulasidas
”), and 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 [1993] 3 SLR(R) 653 (“
Muhammad Nuzaihan
”).
41     In 
Al-Fazli
, a 16-year-old offender pleaded guilty to a charge of doing a rash act to endanger the personal safety of others by throwing down 13 durian husks from the window of a 13
th
 floor flat. The trial court imposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment and a $250 fine; the Prosecution discontinued its appeal. As the Prosecution itself acknowledged in its own submissions,
[note: 12]
 “unreported cases should usually be treated with caution”. Without the benefit of having sight of the reasoning of the sentencing judge, the weight of such a precedent would be undoubtedly very low.
42     Similarly, 
Thulasidas
 was an unreported case where a 17-year-old offender was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for being in a group of seven that attacked a victim several times until he fell to the ground, causing him to sustain a fracture of the tip of his nose, haematomas and swollen lips. Unfortunately, the offender’s appeal lapsed and did not come to fruition to validate the trial court’s decision.
43     The last case of 
Muhammad Nuzaihan
 cited by the Prosecution concerned three charges under the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CMA”). On appeal, imprisonment was imposed instead of the order of probation awarded in the proceedings below. However, other than demonstrating the fact that there could be instances where general deterrence could come to the fore and eclipse rehabilitation where the “public interest” demanded so (at [20]), this case was of little relevance since it would be futile to compare the seriousness of offences across different types of offences. The public interest concerns surrounding cyber-crime offences under the CMA would undoubtedly be irrelevant in the present case.
44     Thus, these authorities cited were of little precedential use in aiding my prioritisation of the sentencing principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in the present case. Having said all these, did the two offences committed by the Appellant amount to a situation where the need for deterrence so overwhelmed and eclipsed the usual dominant principle of rehabilitation for the Appellant, who was only 16 and 15 years of age at the time of the commission of the two offences?
Offender not hardened and recalcitrant; rehabilitative sentencing option viable
45     Though the District Judge was correct to hold that the offences committed by the Appellant were serious and egregious, he had not sufficiently appreciated the reformative prospects of the Appellant. In fact, in applying the 
Boaz
 factors in the first stage of the inquiry, it would seem that he had only considered the first two factors without addressing his mind to the last two factors at all (see GD at [14]–[27]). Although satisfying any 
one
 of the 
Boaz
 factors in an appropriate case might well be 
sufficient
 to hold that rehabilitation had been displaced as the dominant consideration, it would still be necessary to take into account all the facts and circumstances which ultimately aid the court in achieving the right balance between deterrence and rehabilitation. In prioritising the relevant principles, a sentencing judge should not hold that deterrence has displaced rehabilitation without carefully evaluating the rehabilitative potential of the young offender. Doing otherwise would not be adhering to the trite principle that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration when dealing with youthful offenders.
46     In the present case, the Appellant was not a hardened and recalcitrant offender. He had no antecedents and was assessed to have only a moderate risk of re-offending in his psychological
[note: 13]
 and probation reports.
[note: 14]
 His history of aggressive behaviour was not frequent or chronic. I was also of the view that the remorse demonstrated by the Appellant was genuine. Apart from pleading guilty in the proceedings below, he had also acknowledged his wrongdoing and expressed regret for his actions.
[note: 15]
 The testimonials given by the principal of Northlight School as well as the staff at MWH attested to the Appellant’s resilience, diligence and motivation to work on his education and future goals, which was a consistent theme in the testimonials.
[note: 16]
 In terms of his rehabilitative prospects, the senior probation officer was of the view that they were positive:
[note: 17]
 
His progress at school and at MWH show that with the right guidance and structure, he can make positive changes
. He has also 
taken steps to lead a more pro-social lifestyle since the arrest in Mar 2015
. [The Appellant] also has personal goals for himself and is keen to improve himself. To be able to achieve his goals, he will need to learn to consistently think and behave responsibly. [emphasis added]
47     The probation officer eventually did not recommend probation as she felt that the Appellant needed a “closed structured environment for his continued rehabilitation” to provide a “safe setting for him to focus on his rehabilitation”. As I noted above at [4], the Appellant had made positive progress in school and at MWH since his admission into the home. However, the offences in the present case overshadowed his progress. Nonetheless, I noted that, to the Appellant’s credit, he had taken pro-active steps after his arrest to lead a more pro-social lifestyle since. After surrendering himself to the police when they looked for him at his grandmother’s house, he assisted with investigations. He also ceased association with negative peers and stopped engaging in late night activities.
[note: 18]
 Even though his Care and Protection Order expired in August 2015, he voluntarily continued residing at MWH and completed his GCE “N” Levels examinations as well. Overall, the probation officer was of the positive opinion that the Appellant had “presented himself as a resilient, mature and intelligent youth who reflected on and accepted responsibility for his actions.”
[note: 19]
 Notably, the Appellant had also indicated that he wanted to start his life afresh after serving his sentence, and wanted to continue his education, hoping that it would help him lead a pro-social lifestyle in the future.
[note: 20]
 In his psychological report, it was similarly observed that the Appellant had good rehabilitative potential:
[note: 21]
[The Appellant]’s risk may be attenuated in a structured environment. In spite of poor parental support, his positive progress in MWH and school over the past three years evinced resilient personality traits and responsiveness to structured guidance.
48     In my view, it was important to note the Appellant’s potential and motivation for reformation, as well as the circumstances that had contributed to him engaging in antisocial behaviour. In 
Nur Azilah
, Chao JA had felt that the sentencing judge had not given sufficient consideration to the surrounding circumstances under which the appellant had become a runner for loan sharks and why she had come to commit her offences (at [21]):
Importantly, her degree of culpability must be acutely assessed in the light of her surrounding circumstances. As stated in the probationary and reformative training reports, the 
Appellant did not come from a privileged background and her family was struggling to make ends meet
. On the evidence, it was my view that the Appellant started to work for the unlicensed moneylenders out of desperation, rather than greed, in order to support herself. In that frame of mind, she carried out what was instructed by the unlicensed moneylenders. As stated in 
Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 at [21], the courts should presume that youths are impressionable and are unlikely to know the full consequences of their actions. It seemed to me all the more so in this case. I further venture to think that 
her family environment and violence could very well have affected her value judgments on the propriety of her actions
, and thus contributed to her inability to fathom the full consequences of her actions. [emphasis added]
49     Thus, Chao JA came to the conclusion that that was not an appropriate case to depart from the 
norm
 of regarding rehabilitation as the primary objective in the treatment of young offenders, despite the seriousness of the offences committed, and expressed the public interest behind this (at [23]):
I need hardly state that there are various aspects to society’s interests. In my view, it is certainly not in society’s interest to see that young offenders become hardened criminals. On the contrary, society would want to see young offenders turning over a new leaf to become law abiding citizens who will make positive contributions to its development.
50     In the present case, insufficient consideration was also given by the District Judge to the unfortunate circumstances of the Appellant that had led to his antisocial behaviour. I only have to cite his psychological report to illustrate this:
[note: 22]
[The Appellant] grew up in an 
unstable home environment
 characterised by financial difficulties, inconsistent parental care, and domestic violence. The lack of parental supervision and emotional support at home probably led him to gravitate toward neighbourhood peers to seek relatedness. Parents’ substance use at home might have also acted as a negative role model for [him], resulting in his 
normalisation of antisocial behaviour
 at a young age. While these factors might have contributed to [his] susceptibility to an antisocial lifestyle, his witnessing of domestic violence probably had more 
direct influence on his use of violence
. Specifically, the 
domestic violence during [his] developmental years
 might lead him to understand interpersonal relationships through hostile attribution and physical aggression.
…
In addition, the poor supervision in the community also led him to associate with negative peers who 
condoned the use of violence
. This in turn maintained his aggressive behaviour in the community.
[emphasis added]
51     The clinical psychologist also assessed that the Appellant’s aggressive acts in the slashing incident were “precipitated by the verbal and physical provocation from the victim” when his “hostile misattribution also led him to perceive the victim to be aggressive and provocative”.
[note: 23]
 It was clear to me that consideration had to be given to the Appellant’s unfortunate background which had resulted in his normalisation of antisocial behaviour, and had led him to understand relationships through hostile attribution and physical aggression.
[note: 24]
 Like how Chao JA noted in 
Nur Azilah
 (citing 
Maurice Mok
), youths are more likely to be impressionable and may not realise the full consequences of their actions. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences and the harm caused, I had to take a nuanced view as to the degree of Appellant’s culpability and not accord too high a significance to the level of deterrence needed that would replace rehabilitation as the usual dominant sentencing consideration.
52     Thus, taking into account both the need for deterrence and the rehabilitative prospects of the Appellant, I was of the view that rehabilitation as a dominant sentencing consideration was 
diminished
, but 
not totally eclipsed
.
Reformative training most appropriate
53     In the second step, having established that rehabilitation still remained an important consideration despite the seriousness of the offences committed and the harm caused, I turned to consider the various sentencing options at my disposal to decide which was the most appropriate. I concluded that a sentence of reformative training was the most suitable to balance the need for deterrence and the recognition that rehabilitation was still important in the present situation.
54     In 
Cheng Thomas v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 3 SLR(R) 828
 at [13], Yong CJ recognised that the accused had needed strict guidance and enforced reformation for another shot at rehabilitation and hence upheld a sentence of reformative training:
Taking into consideration the 
young age of the appellant and his unfortunate family background
, I decided that it was appropriate to give him 
another chance at rehabilitation
. Since young, the appellant 
had lacked proper parental guidance and supervision
, his parents having separated since he was three years old, and this was probably 
the fundamental cause of his unruliness
. The appellant was in serious need of some strict guidance and enforced reformation. 
This would not be suitably provided in a custodial sentence.
 [emphasis added]
55     Similarly here, the Appellant was assessed to require structured guidance to which he had had been responsive to so far, so as to evince his potential for reformation.
[note: 25]
 He needed a “closed, structured environment for his 
continued rehabilitation
” (emphasis added).
[note: 26]
 His reformative training suitability report was also positive,
[note: 27]
 indicating that he was suitable for the reformative training regime, with programmes recommended to help him overcome his negative thoughts and underlying violent behaviour, as well as to help strengthen his family network and employment skills to enhance his reintegration potential.
56     Ultimately, I felt that it was appropriate to give the Appellant a chance at rehabilitation, considering his unfortunate family background, young age, rehabilitative potential and positive steps taken so far after his arrest. After all, his violence risk had been assessed to be elevated when there was negative peer influence and inadequate pro-social activities.
[note: 28]
 The corrupt influence of a prison environment would thus not be desirable for the Appellant to realise his reformative potential. Reformative training was most appropriate as the Appellant would go through a rehabilitative programme in a structured environment without being exposed to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment: see 
Boaz
 at [38].
Conclusion
57     For the reasons stated above, I allowed the appeal against sentence and ordered the Appellant’s sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane to be substituted with a sentence of reformative training.
58     As the reformative training would be for a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of 36 months, it would be pertinent to note that the period the Appellant would be detained in the reformative training centre would actually be longer than the Appellant’s sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, for which he might even be released six months earlier for good behaviour in the latter situation. The Appellant was fully aware of this and still appealed to be sentenced to reformative training with a view to have himself rehabilitated.

 Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):
Introduction
1       Criminal Motion No 25 of 2015 (“CM 25/2015”) concerned an application for leave, pursuant to s 397(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”), for the Court of Appeal to answer certain questions of law relating to s 57C(2) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Questions”). The application was wholly unmeritorious and turned out to be nothing more than an attempt to challenge the findings of fact made by the courts below under the guise of referring “question[s] of law of public interest” to the Court of Appeal.
2       The present grounds of decision are not focused on the merits of the application, which are patently lacking (as will be detailed below), but on the Prosecution’s request that costs be imposed against the Applicant. After considering all the circumstances, it was with some reluctance that we eventually decided 
not
 to impose costs against the Applicant. However, in the light of an increasing number of such unmeritorious applications that are coming before this court, we find it appropriate to set out our views regarding the imposition of costs for such applications.
3       Before doing so, we briefly state the facts surrounding the application in CM 25/2015 and our reasons for declining leave to refer the Questions to the Court of Appeal.
Facts
4       The Applicant had been convicted in the District Court for a charge under s 57C(2) of the Immigration Act (“the Act”) for arranging a marriage of convenience between two individuals known as “Tay” and “Bai” so that Bai, a Chinese national, could extend her stay in Singapore through a long term pass. Both Bai and Tay pleaded guilty to, and were convicted of, an offence under s 57C(1) of the Act for entering into a marriage of convenience. The District Judge found that the Applicant had suggested the marriage, provided money to Tay to enter into the marriage, and had secured the venue, wedding rings and witnesses for the solemnisation ceremony. In the premises, the District Judge sentenced the Applicant to eight months’ imprisonment. The Applicant brought an appeal against her conviction and sentence to the High Court. The High Court Judge accepted the findings made by the District Judge and dismissed the Applicant’s appeal.
The application 
5       The above events led the Applicant to file the CM 25/2015 wherein she sought leave for the following questions to be answered by the Court of Appeal (
ie
, the Questions):
1.    Section 57C(2) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (IA) makes it an offence when any person :-
(a)    arranges
(b)    intentionally
(c)    in assisting a marriage
(d)    to obtain an 
immigration advantage
.
The meaning of each of this [
sic
] words, especially “arrange” or “arranges” is a question of law of public interest as it will determine the scope or ambit of the section.
2.    In what circumstances or when is an offence under section 57C(2) IA committed, is it in procuring or suggesting or requesting a party to contract a marriage or is it made out when all that the Applicant does is in making available the venue for marriage, getting the rings and securing a witness or does it involve the Applicant doing both procuring a party to the marriage and doing such acts facilitating the marriage such that “and” be read conjunctively or disjunctively.
3.    Alternatively, what is the meaning of the word “arrange” or “arranges” in the context of s 57C(2) IA, does it constitute the procurement, suggestion or hints to a party to contract a marriage such that if at the altar one of the parties to the marriage refuses to be betrothed the offence is completed or otherwise.
[emphasis in original]
6       In support of her application, the Applicant argued that she “had never accosted, induced or even requested Tay to marry Bai” and “had not suggested or pleaded with Tay to extend Bai’s stay in Singapore”. She further submitted that, at its highest, the evidence of Tay revealed that Tay had made the independent decision to marry Bai. The Applicant’s involvement was allegedly restricted only to securing the venue, rings and witnesses for the marriage.
Our decision
7       As noted above, we denied leave for the Applicant to refer the Questions to the Court of Appeal.
8       The law with respect to when leave should be granted under s 397(1) of the CPC is clear and was recently affirmed by this court in 
Lee Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGCA 67
 (“
Winston Lee
”) at [6]. Four conditions must be satisfied before leave can be granted:
(a)     First, the reference to the Court of Appeal can only be made in relation to a criminal matter decided by the High Court in exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction.
(b)     Secondly, the reference must relate to a question of law and that question of law must be a question of law of public interest.
(c)     Thirdly, the question of law must have arisen from the case which was before the High Court.
(d)     Fourthly, the determination of that question of law by the High Court must have affected the outcome of the case.
9       In our judgment, each of the Questions failed to satisfy at least one of the four conditions. From both the written and oral submissions canvassed before us by the Applicant’s counsel, it was evident that the dissatisfaction which the Applicant had against the lower courts’ decisions had nothing to do with the answers to any purported 
questions of law
. Rather, her dissatisfaction was with the District Judge’s and High Court Judge’s refusal to find, 
as a matter of fact
, that Tay had made the independent decision to marry Bai and that the Applicant’s involvement was limited only to securing the venue, rings and witnesses for the marriage. Essentially, through this criminal reference, the Applicant was attempting to reargue her position that her limited role in the entire sequence of events (an account of events which was rejected by the lower courts) could not amount to her having “arranged” the marriage of convenience.
10     This was clearly a case in which there were 
no
 questions of law – let alone questions of law of public interest – that arose for consideration by this court. On the contrary, all the arguments proffered by counsel for the Applicant were mere reprises of arguments that had already been tendered in the courts below and which related (
only
) to issues of 
fact
. More precisely, all these issues related to the 
application
 of the relevant law to the 
facts
 of the case (in this case, whether the relevant facts demonstrated that an “arrangement” had been entered into within the meaning of s 57C(2) of the Act).
11     Counsel for the Applicant, Mr S K Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), attempted, instead, to turn the logic of the matter on its head by arguing that a question of law arose as to the meaning of the word “arrangement”. However, whether or not there is an “arrangement” within the meaning of the provision just mentioned depends on the 
facts
 and the argument by Mr Kumar is, with respect, not only misconceived but also irretrievably circular in nature. Indeed, as this court observed in 
Public Prosecutor v Teo Chu Ha
 
[2014] 4 SLR 600
 at [31]:
… As a matter of principle, the courts must determine whether there is sufficient 
generality
 embedded within a proposition posed by the question which is more than just descriptive but also 
contains 
normative 
force for it to qualify as a question of 
law
; a question which has, at its heart, a proposition which is 
descriptive
 and 
specific 
to the case at hand is merely a question of 
fact
. … [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]
12     We would add that it was precisely this misguided attempt to recast the Applicant’s grievances as “questions of law” that one of the Questions posed was in fact 
a hypothetical scenario 
which had no bearing on the case whatsoever
 – whether an offence of “arranging” a marriage of convenience would be made out if the marriage is never entered into. On the present facts, it was undisputed that Tay and Bai did enter into the marriage.
13     Put simply, what the Applicant was attempting to do in the present application was 
to re-litigate her case in the form of yet another appeal – a course of action which was clearly prohibited by law
. Given the very nature of what she was seeking to do and the arguments that she was constrained to proffer to this court, any attempt to “dress up” her application in the form of a question of law of public interest was ultimately an exercise in futility. We state all this, in the main, because the Prosecution raised a further issue before us – whether the Applicant ought to be made to pay costs pursuant to s 356 of the CPC. It is to this which we now turn our attention.
Imposition of costs against the Applicant
14     Section 356 of the CPC provides as follows:
 
Costs ordered by Court of Appeal or High Court
 
 
356.
—(1) The Court of Appeal or the High Court in the exercise of its powers under Part XX may award costs to be paid by or to the parties as it thinks fit.
(2) Where the Court of Appeal or the High Court makes any order for costs to be paid by the prosecution to an accused, the Court must be satisfied that the conduct of the matter under Part XX by the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious.
(3) Where the Court of Appeal or the High Court makes any order for costs to be paid by an accused to the prosecution, the Court must be satisfied that the conduct of the matter under Part XX by the accused was done in an extravagant and unnecessary manner.
15     Section 356 of the CPC was adapted from s 262 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (
ie
, the old CPC) under which the High Court had the full power in all proceedings concerning “Appeals, Points Reserved and Revision” to award “such costs to be paid by or to the parties thereto as the Court thinks fit”. Section 356(1) of the CPC now establishes clearly that this is a power which also extends to the Court of Appeal and ss 356(2) and (3) go on to specify the circumstances in which the courts may order such costs against the Prosecution or an accused respectively.
16     The key provision we consider in the present case is that of s 356(3) of the CPC, which applies to an accused and in which the court “must be satisfied that the conduct of the matter … by the accused was done in 
an extravagant and unnecessary manner
” [emphasis added]. Whether or not an accused has, in fact, acted in such a manner obviously depends upon 
the precise facts and circumstances of the each case
 (see also 
per
 Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Arun Kaliamurthy and others v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2014] 3 SLR 1023
 (“
Arun Kaliamurthy
”) at [35]).
17     In 
Arun Kaliamurthy
, Tan JC considered the interpretation of not only s 356, but also s 409 of the CPC, both of which differ slightly in wording. Section 356 relates to the High Court 
and
 the Court of Appeal’s power to award costs with respect to Part XX of the CPC (
ie
, appeals, points reserved, revisions and criminal motions). In so far as the latter provision is concerned, it provides, more specifically, for the High Court’s power to award costs if it dismisses a criminal motion. Section 409 of the CPC reads as follows:
 
Costs
 
 
409
. If the High Court dismisses a criminal motion and is of the opinion that the motion was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court, it may, either on the application of the respondent or on its own motion, order the applicant of the criminal motion to pay to the respondent costs on an indemnity basis or otherwise fixed by the Court.
18     From the above provisions, the following principles may be distilled:
(a)      
The Prosecution
 could be made to pay costs to an accused person by the High Court or the Court of Appeal if the conduct of the matter by the Prosecution is “frivolous or vexatious” (see s 356(2) of the CPC).
(b)      
An accused
 could be made to pay costs to the Prosecution by the High Court or the Court of Appeal if he conducts the matter in a manner that is “extravagant and unnecessary” (see s 356(3) of the CPC).
(c)      
An applicant
 could be made to pay costs to the respondent by the High Court if the criminal motion is deemed to be “frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process of the Court” (see s 409 of the CPC).
19     Notwithstanding that different terms are used to describe the circumstances in which costs may be awarded pursuant to either s 356 or 409 of the CPC, Tan JC noted in 
Arun Kaliamurthy
 (at [35]) that “the matters to be assessed in determining whether [a criminal motion] is frivolous or vexatious, or an abuse of process of the court, are similar to those 
vis-à-vis
 determining whether the accused persons had conducted the matter in an extravagant and unnecessary manner”. 
We agree with the observations made by Tan JC.
 Whether one uses the words “frivolous or vexatious” or “extravagant and unnecessary”, when deciding whether costs should be awarded in a criminal proceeding, the court should ultimately look at the circumstances as a whole and scrutinise, 
inter alia
, the facts of the case, the strength of the Defence (or Prosecution) and the course of conduct of the Defence (or Prosecution) (see 
Arun Kaliamurthy
 at [35], citing the observations of Yong Pung How CJ in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Abex Centre Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 1 SLR(R) 598
 at [15]).
20     When viewed in the context of the filing of a criminal reference, an application 
which in substance is manifestly a “back-door” appeal that merely seeks to re-litigate issues of fact that have already been decided in the courts below would, in our view (and absent additional as well as exceptional circumstances), constitute the conduct of the matter by the accused being “done in an extravagant and unnecessary manner”
. This must surely be the case because to begin with, the framework of permissible appeals in this context is a straightforward aspect of our law and the central feature of which is that there is no right to bring a further appeal in such matters to the Court of Appeal. So too is the rationale underlying the possibility of bringing a reference on a question of law of public interest. So too is the distinction between the two. These are not points of notable or unusual difficulty. And where it is evident that an applicant is in fact seeking to disguise an impermissible appeal as a reference on a question of law of public interest, this would seem to us to border on an abuse of the process of the court and such applications – each involving, as they necessarily must, valuable time on the part of counsel for the respective respondents as well as the courts concerned – 
not only waste valuable time but also undermine (in the starkest manner possible) the very 
raison d’être
 of s 397 of the CPC itself
. In so far as the latter point is concerned, such applications constitute 
the very antithesis
 of what s 397 of the CPC (“s 397”) is intended to accomplish. This particular provision is not intended to furnish a 
yet further right of 
appeal
 to either party. However, in the 
public interest
, s 397 furnishes an 
exceptional
 legal mechanism in situations where a point of law of public interest needs to be clarified by the Court of Appeal in order to furnish the requisite legal guidance for the sake of the legal system generally. 
Even then
, s 397 
cannot
 be utilised in order to enable the Court of Appeal to clarify the law in a 
purely hypothetical or academic manner or, worse, to try to eke out an extra appeal when this is expressly not permitted
.
21     That s 397 
cannot
 be utilised as a covert or “back-door” appeal is clear from the following observations (also cited by the Prosecution in their written submissions to this court) by the then Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, with regard to the legislative predecessor of s 397, when he observed that the discretion given to the High Court to refuse leave to refer questions to the Court of Appeal was intended to “sieve out questions which are not genuine points of law and are not of public interest and which are 
advanced merely as a guise for what is in fact an appeal
” [emphasis added] (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (12 April 1993) vol 61 at col 116). In the Singapore High Court decision of 
Ng Ai Tiong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 1 SLR(R) 490
, Yong Pung How CJ affirmed Parliament’s intention in this regard and noted as follows (at [10]):
… In all these cases, it has been the common emphasis that the discretion under s 60, SCJA [
ie
, the legislative predecessor of s 397 of the CPC], must be exercised sparingly by the High Court. This is to give recognition and effect to Parliament’s intention for the High Court to be the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the Subordinate Courts. 
The 
importance of maintaining finality 
in such proceedings must not be seen to be easily compromised through the use of such a statutory device.
 In 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
[1990] 1 SLR(R) 198
 at [30], Chan Sek Keong J [as he then was] had cautioned aptly that:
[Section 60, SCJA] is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts. …
 
Hence, it is 
 
imperative 
 
that s 60 of the SCJA is utilised only
 
in exceptional cases so as to ensure that the proper purpose of the section is not abused to serve as a form of “backdoor appeal”.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
More recently, this court, in 
Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2013] 2 SLR 141
, observed (in a similar vein) thus (at [21]):
To liberally construe s 397 so as to more freely allow a reference to the Court of Appeal would 
seriously undermine the system of one-tier appeal
. The interests of finality would strongly militate against the grant of such a reference save in very limited circumstances. [emphasis added]
22     Returning to the present case, it is clear – as has already been emphasised above – that the Applicant had 
already
 exercised her right of appeal to the High Court and was essentially utilising s 397 as a “back-door” appeal. The present case therefore indeed represented an attempt by the Applicant to conduct her case in the context of an application for a criminal reference “in an extravagant and unnecessary manner” and 
prima facie
 merited an award of costs against her. However, we eventually decided against doing so for one specific reason – this was the first time that the issue as to whether or not an application for a criminal reference which was a thinly veiled disguise for a “back-door” appeal on the facts ought to result in an award of costs came squarely before this court, or at least was an issue that this court thought might merit a decision. In 
Phang Wah v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2012] SGCA 60
, this court had previously cautioned that “potential applicants would … do well to avoid attempting such “back door” appeals by recourse to s 397 CPC” (at [37]) and that such applications do not “permit a dissatisfied accused a third bite at the cherry” [at [38]). However, we note that the issue of costs was not raised or discussed in that particular decision. Be that as it may, it is deeply unfortunate that applicants have not heeded this caution and that we still see an influx of such unmeritorious applications before this court.
23     We therefore find it appropriate to state unequivocally that the bringing of such unmeritorious applications will not be countenanced and that this court will, henceforth, not hesitate to award costs against applicants who attempt “back-door” appeals by recourse to s 397. There will be 
no excuse
 for applicants who choose to waste valuable court time as well as the time of lawyers for the other party and (more importantly) make light of a statutory provision that is intended to be invoked 
in only exceptional circumstances in the public interest
.
24     We would also add that, pursuant to s 356(2) of the CPC, 
the Prosecution
 could also be made to pay the accused costs. Although that particular subsection is worded differently (in that the Prosecution’s conduct of the matter must be “frivolous or vexatious”), as noted above, similar considerations 
vis-à-vis
 determining whether the conduct of the matter is “extravagant and unnecessary” would apply. This is 
not
 to say, however, that the considerations when deciding whether to award costs against the Prosecution as compared to an accused are 
one and the same
. In this regard, in 
The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary
 (Jennifer Marie and Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012), the learned authors opined as follows (at para 18.015):
It would be interesting to assess the jurisprudential developments 
vis-à-vis
 the matter as to when, and to what extent, the Prosecution would be liable for costs. Suffice it to say that in light of the fact that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion cannot, generally speaking, be reviewed save in very circumscribed situations (see 
Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
), and the fact that the decision to prosecute may, at times be dependent on considerations that may be wholly legitimate but that may not be admissible in a court of law (or is otherwise not a factor that a court can take cognizance of in the determination of guilt), the awarding of such costs against the Prosecution, where it was the Public Prosecutor who arrived at the decision to prosecute would be 
limited to the most exceptional of circumstances
. [emphasis added]
We note, however, that the above observations were made in the context of the bringing of frivolous or vexatious 
prosecutions
 (as compared to a criminal reference). Since this was not an issue that arose before us, we decline to render any conclusion on this point save to say, without the benefit of full arguments, that the above observations appear to be of weight.
25     Having said that, it seems to us that it would indeed be “frivolous or vexatious” for the Prosecution to file 
a criminal reference
 which did not raise a question of law of public interest and 
which was, instead, a “back-door” appeal
. Indeed, we should hope that such a situation would never arise before us as the Prosecution has a higher duty as a representative of the State. If, however, such a situation should arise, it would clearly be “frivolous or vexatious” for the precise reason we have just stated.
26     Finally, we would observe that, in certain exceptional circumstances (which are, by their very nature, fact and context sensitive), the 
defence counsel
 concerned might be made to bear costs payable under s 356(3) of the CPC 
personally
. Indeed, such an order was made by Tan JC in 
Arun Kaliamurthy
 where he noted that pursuant to s 357(1) of the CPC, the court has the power to either (i) direct defence counsel to repay any costs which his client has been ordered to pay to any person; or (ii) disallow costs as between defence counsel and his client.
Conclusion
27     We hope that this decision serves as a timely reminder to applicants and their counsel that criminal references should not be resorted to lightly and that judgment should be exercised prudently before one chooses to embark on such a course of action. We recognise that there is ultimately a public interest element in criminal litigation and this decision should not act as a deterrent to meritorious criminal references being brought before this court. To be sure there will be cases which admit of a genuine difference of view; but in our experience, those are far and few between. The majority, like the present, tend to be straightforward and misguided attempts to prolong the process by trying to smuggle an appeal under the umbrella of s 397. In this regard, we must bear in mind the caution rendered by Tay Yong Kwang J in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Ong Boon Kheng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] SGHC 199
 (at [14]) that “[i]t only takes a little ingenuity to re-cast what is a straightforward, commonsensical application of principles of law to the relevant facts into an apparent legal conundrum which seemingly calls for determination by the highest court of the land”. Accordingly, henceforth, one can expect the abuse resulting from such “ingenuity” to be met with costs implications.",2016-07-13 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Judgment Reserved
 Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the oral judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       The appeal before us arises out of a complex factual matrix which pertains, in the main, to a shipbuilding contract which had been entered into between the appellant, Simgood Pte Ltd (“Simgood”) and the first defendant in the suit below, MLC Shipbuilding Sdn Bhd (“MLC Shipbuilding). Under the terms of the contract, the latter was to construct and deliver a vessel with hull number 5282 to Simgood (“Contract 5282”). MLC Shipbuilding failed to deliver this vessel.
2       Apart from a cause of action in contract against MLC Shipbuilding, Simgood also brought claims against eight other defendants in the suit below. Simgood alleged that these defendants had contributed, in some way, to MLC Shipbuilding’s failure to deliver the vessel. A key allegation made by Simgood was that the seventh to ninth defendants (who were either shareholders or directors of MLC Shareholding or its affiliate companies) had dishonestly swapped the hull numbers of two vessels and this had, according to Simgood, resulted in the non-delivery of the vessel under Contract 5282.
3       In the decision below, the Judge found that while the seventh to ninth defendants’ acts were dishonest, the reason they swapped the hull numbers was to postpone the repayment of a loan facility with DBS Bank Ltd and the swap did not have a bearing on MLC Shipbuilding’s failure to deliver the vessel to Simgood. The Judge eventually held that only MLC Shipbuilding was liable for failing to deliver the vessel to Simgood and therefore ordered specific performance of Contract 5282, failing which MLC Shipbuilding would have to pay damages to Simgood. The Judge additionally held that the fifth defendant (“Nantong MLC”), which was the Chinese company actually constructing the vessel, was liable in the tort of detinue. Nantong MLC was therefore also ordered to deliver up the vessel to Simgood, failing which it would be liable to pay damages to Simgood. It was subsequently revealed that the vessel had already been sold to an unknown third party although it is not clear who had sold the vessel.
4       This led Simgood to commence the present appeal as against five of the nine defendants in the suit below (“the Respondents”). The Respondents consist of the following:
(a)     MLC Barging Pte Ltd (“MLC Barging”), an affiliate company of MLC Shipbuilding (the second defendant in the suit);
(b)     MLC Maritime Pte Ltd (“MLC Maritme”), an affiliate company of MLC Shipbuilding (the third defendant in the suit);
(c)     Tan Ho Seng (“Tan”), a shareholder and/or director of MLC Shipbuilding, MLC Barging, MLC Maritime and Nantong MLC (the seventh defendant in the suit);
(d)     Eng Chor Wah (“Eng”), the wife of Tan Ho Seng, who is also a shareholder and director of MLC Maritime (the eighth defendant in the suit); and
(e)     Nantong Tongbao Shipbuilding Co Ltd (“Nantong Tongbao”), a Chinese company which initially owned 56% of the shares in Nantong MLC although this may have been reduced to 40% pursuant to a shareholder’s resolution in June 2008 (the sixth defendant in the suit). Nantong Tongbao did not participate in the trial.
For ease of reference, Tan and Eng will be referred to collectively as “the Tans”.
5       According to Simgood, the Judge should have found the Respondents liable under four heads of action: (a) the Respondents had committed the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means; (b) the Respondents had committed the tort of inducing the breach of Contract 5282; (c) the corporate veil should be pierced such that several of the Respondents should be concurrently liable for the wrongs committed by Nantong MLC; and (d) a remedial constructive trust should be imposed over the vessel.
6       We heard the parties on 7 July 2016, and reserved judgment to consider certain factual issues which had arisen in the course of the hearing. Having considered the matter further, we dismiss Simgood’s appeal in Civil Appeal No 165 of 2015 (“CA 165/2015”). A comprehensive exposition of the facts may be found in the Judge’s decision of 
Simgood Pte Ltd v MLC Shipbuilding Sdn Bhd and others
 
[2015] SGHC 303
 (“the GD”) at [1]–[49]. For present purposes, we preface the reasons for our decision with a summary of the facts which are germane to the determination of this appeal.
Summary of facts
7       In April 2008, Simgood and its affiliate companies entered into a series of shipbuilding contracts with MLC Shipbuilding. Apart from Contract 5282, another relevant contract in this series of contracts was that entered into between MLC Shipbuilding and PT Indoliziz (
ie
, an affiliate company of Simgood) for the former to construct and deliver to the latter a vessel with hull number 5284 (“Contract 5284”). Prior to these contracts being entered into, the keel for a vessel which bore hull number 5282 had already been laid. This vessel was referred to as “Vessel A” in the GD.
8       In July or August 2008, the Tans formulated a plan with Redzuan Goh Bin Mohammed Karian (“Redzuan”), their then son-in-law and the ninth defendant in the suit below, to change the hull number of Vessel A from 5282 to 5284. At that time, Vessel A was at an advanced stage of construction. In September 2008, the keels for a further two vessels were laid. One of these vessels was assigned hull number 5282. This vessel was referred to as “Vessel B” in the GD. With Vessel A now bearing hull number 5284 and Vessel B bearing hull number 5282, this meant that Contract 5282 was further from completion.
9       According to the Judge, the Tans and Redzuan switched the hull numbers between Vessel A and Vessel B in order to take further advantage of a loan facility extended by DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”) that was attached to a vessel bearing hull number 5282. By making the switch, the loan facility would no longer be tied to Vessel A, which was closer to completion at that time (see [114] of the GD]).
10     As part of the plan, the Tans and Redzuan also engineered a series of contracts which, 
inter alia
, altered the ownership of Vessel B. The purported effect of these contracts was the interposition of MLC Barging into the contractual picture such that it was to be regarded as the seller of Vessel B to MLC Shipbuilding, and MLC Shipbuilding would then on-sell the Vessel to Simgood. The Judge found that the reason for the creation of this contractual chain was so that DBS would not be aware of the change in hull numbers between Vessel A and Vessel B (see [118] of the GD). The Judge further found that these contracts were sham contracts and gave no effect to them (see [96] of the GD).
11     Vessel A was subsequently completed in March 2009 and was delivered under Contract 5284. MLC Shipbuilding, however, failed to deliver Vessel B to Simgood by the stipulated date of delivery under Contract 5282, 
ie
, 7 June 2009. This led Simgood to issue a letter of demand to MLC Shipbuilding and various other defendants on 7 October 2010 demanding for the delivery of Vessel B. The events which transpired between June 2009 and October 2010 are murky, to say the least, although it would appear that there was some correspondence between MLC Barging and Simgood from January 2010 wherein MLC Barging took the position that because MLC Shipbuilding failed to make payments to it for Vessel B, it had no obligation to deliver Vessel B to MLC Shipbuilding, and in turn no obligation as well to deliver Vessel B to Simgood. Simgood eventually commenced action in January 2011.
Our decision
12     We turn now to address each of the four causes of action relied upon by Simgood in the present appeal.
Unlawful means conspiracy
13     As noted recently in the Court of Appeal decision of 
EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another
 
[2014] 1 SLR 860
 (“
EFT Holdings
”) at [112], to succeed in a claim of unlawful means conspiracy, the plaintiff has to show the following:
(a)     there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts;
(b)     the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those acts;
(c)     the acts were unlawful;
(d)     the acts were to be performed in furtherance of the agreement; and
(e)     the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.
14     Simgood’s case in this regard rests entirely on the fact that the Respondents’ acts of switching the hull numbers of Vessel A and Vessel B without its consent and creating the sham contractual structure amounted to unlawful acts, and that these acts were carried out with the intention to injure Simgood. However, this assertion was not accepted by the Judge who found that those acts were committed 
not
 to injure Simgood, but to abuse the loan facility from DBS (see [118] and [180] of the GD).
15     We see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding. The conclusion reached by the Judge is supported by two internal emails between the Tans and Redzuan. The first email, dated 11 August 2008, was sent from Eng to Redzuan, with Tan copied, and it showed that the reason for switching the hull numbers was so that they could continue benefiting from the DBS loan facility:
Dear Redzuan,
As we are selling the MLC 5281 & 5282 to Alam & Steven, we need to consider the two options mentioned below:-
Option One:-
Before Delivery, we will pay DBS for USD 9,700,00.00 being the loan taken till date for both vessels.
Option Two:-
Continue with the vessel financing from DBS. Each vessel DBS finance us USD5,950,000.00 Total USD11,900,000.00 for both vessels. If we choose this option, we have to get Jiangsu Soho Marine to extend the Refund Guarantee to next year which they have verbally agreed & 
we have to swap the Hull No. MLC 5283 to MLC 5281 & Hull No MLC 5284 to MLC 5282
.
Should we take option one or two? Please advice (sic) as soon as possible as we need to make the necessary changes with Jiangsu Soho & DBS.
[emphasis added]
Redzuan replied to this email to endorse Option two.
16     The next relevant email, dated 1 October 2008, was also from Eng to Redzuan and copied to Tan, and it pertained to why they had to create the sham contractual structure:
The Hull No. of these two vessels have been changed to MLC 5283 (from MLC 5281) & 5284 (from MLC 5282). Since MLC 5283 & 5284 belong to [MLC Shipbuilding], [MLC Shipbuilding] would have to assist in servicing these two loans.
The problem is how to show in our books that [MLC Shipbuilding] is paying to MLC Carrier (Owner for MLC 5281) & MLC Maritime (owner for MLC 5282) as the hull no. now has been changed to MLC 5283 & 5284 and these two hull no belong to [MLC Shipbuilding].
We cannot inform DBS of the changes in Hull No because the loan has been drawn down & all the security documents have been executed. In view of this, we are currently building two new hulls (MLC 5281 & 5282) for replacement. So far we have drawn down US$4,850,000 for each vessel. The loan for each vessel is US$5,950,000.00. …
 
In my opinion is [MLC Shipbuilding] pay the whole monthly loan amount of USD178,528 to MLC Maritime and we will treat this as deposit for MLC 5282 since this vessel has been sold to Steven, [MLC Shipbuilding] would buy this vessel from MLC Maritime when it is ready for delivery. By then, we will inform DBS bank that MLC 5282 vessel has been sold to [MLC Shipbuilding].
 MLC Maritime would then loan MLC Carrier half of the amount to service the loan for MLC 5281.
[emphasis added]
Redzuan replied on the same day agreeing with the above proposal.
17     In our judgment, from the above, the Judge was correct in making the finding that the dishonest conduct of the Tans and Redzuan in switching the hull numbers and creating the sham contractual chain had everything to do with concealing the state of affairs from DBS, and had nothing to do with any alleged intention to injure Simgood. This conclusion is further fortified by the fact that MLC Shipbuilding did perform its obligation under Contract 5284 and delivered Vessel A to Simgood’s affiliate company. If it were truly the Respondents’ intention to cause loss to Simgood right from the outset, one would have expected MLC Shipbuilding to not deliver Vessel A either. It should be emphasised that in 
EFT Holdings
, the Court of Appeal held (at [101]) that to establish the tort of unlawful means conspiracy, a claimant “would have to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted or directed at the claimant” and that “[i]t is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be a likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct.” In other words, “[i]njury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself”. Like the Judge below, we do not think that when the Tans had embarked on their unlawful course of conduct in 2008, they had this requisite intention.
18     In the course of the hearing before us, however, counsel for Simgood sought to pitch its case at a different level and argued that the Tans’ and MLC Barging’s 
reliance
 on the sham contractual structure to refuse delivery of Vessel B in 2010 constituted the unlawful act and that by this time, they had formed the intention to injure Simgood. While this 
could
 have been a viable argument, we could not ignore the fact that this was not Simgood’s pleaded case. Even during the cross-examination of the Tans, the case that was put to them was that they had formed the intention to injure Simgood in 2008. No argument was advanced at the trial below on the basis that the acts which constituted the tort occurred in 2010. It was for this precise reason, as noted above, that the evidence on the events which transpired in 2010 was patently lacking.
19     Accordingly, we uphold the Judge’s finding that the tort of unlawful means conspiracy has not been established.
Inducing breach of contract
20     It is for the same reasons detailed above that we cannot hold the Respondents liable for the tort of inducing breach of contract. Simgood’s pleaded case was that the Tans’ acts of switching the hull numbers and creating the sham contractual chain in 2008 had induced MLC Shipbuilding to breach Contract 5282. We are, however, unable to find a causal link between the Tans’ actions in 2008 and MLC Shipbuilding’s failure to deliver Vessel B from 2009 to 2010. While again, it 
might
 have been viable to suggest that it was the Tans’ act of 
relying
 on the sham contractual structure in 2010 which induced MLC Shipbuilding’s breach of contract, this was not Simgood’s pleaded case. In any event, there was a dearth of evidence which would allow us to satisfactorily come to the conclusion that the Tans’ acts in 2010 had the effect of “influencing” MLC Shipbuilding’s breach of Contract 5282 (see Gary Chan Kok Yew & Lee Pey Woan, 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 15.012). Again, this is unsurprising since the evidence which was elicited from the Tans on cross-examination pertained mainly to the events in 2008 and not 2010.
21     We therefore find that the Judge was correct in dismissing Simgood’s cause of action in the tort of inducing breach of contract.
Piercing the corporate veil
22     As for Simgood’s allegation that the corporate veil should be pierced, we note from the Appellant’s case that Simgood seeks to pierce the veil in two ways: first, that “[t]he Judge ought to have pierced the corporate veil, so as to find [Nantong Tongbao] concurrently liable with [Nantong MLC]” and secondly, that “the Judge ought to have pierced the corporate veil, to find the Tans … liable to [Simgood] for the tortious acts of [Nantong MLC]”. We are unable to agree with Simgood that the corporate veil could be pierced in either of the suggested ways.
23     Regarding piercing the corporate veil from Nantong MLC to Nantong Tongbao, we are of the view that there is no merit in Simgood’s argument that Nantong Tongbao was not a separate entity from Nantong MLC. Nantong MLC is a joint venture between Nantong Tongbao and the Tans and in that regard, one would expect that there would be a certain level of interconnectedness between Nantong Tongbao and Nantong MLC. However, the evidence adduced before us did not establish that this interconnectedness rose to the level necessary for us to pierce the corporate veil.
24     In fact, Simgood’s argument in this respect is undermined by the second basis in which it sought to pierce the corporate veil. In advancing the submission that the Tans should be liable for the tortious acts of Nantong MLC, Simgood argued that the Tans had control over Nantong MLC. To suggest that Nantong Tongbao and Nantong MLC were one and the same, and to argue in the same breath that the Tans had control of Nantong MLC, is in our judgment, a contradiction. It should be emphasised that the Tans and Nantong Tongbao are entirely separate personalities; Nantong Tongbao is owned by two Chinese individuals with no personal relationship to the Tans.
25     Furthermore, Simgood’s argument that the Tans had control of Nantong MLC is contradicted by the fact that there had been disputes between the Tans and Nantong Tongbao’s representative in Nantong MLC (
ie
, Zhu Jian Hua) regarding the running of the company (see [38]–[41] of the GD). Their disagreements culminated in Zhu Jian Hua trying to oust the Tans from all involvement in Nantong MLC in 2010 and it was pursuant to Tan’s legal action in China that he was reinstated as a director of Nantong MLC. This state of affairs, which has not been contradicted by Simgood, hardly evidences the Tans having control over Nantong MLC.
26     Accordingly, we find that the corporate veil should not be pierced so as to find either Nantong Tongbao or the Tans liable for Nantong MLC’s tortious acts.
Remedial constructive trust
27     Finally, the claim for remedial constructive trust over Vessel B may be disposed of briefly. For one, it is not even clear as to who exactly Simgood is suggesting should be treated as constructive trustee of the Vessel. More importantly, Simgood has not provided any legitimate reason or basis to say that the doctrine of remedial constructive trust should apply in the present case.
Conclusion
28     For the reasons above, we dismiss Simgood’s appeal in CA 165/2015. Having so ruled, we by no means suggest that we condone the Tans’ business behaviour. While their sharp practice, as pleaded, may not be sufficient to substantiate the various causes of action which Simgood has brought against them, we find it imperative to express our disapproval of the same.

Judgment reserved.
 Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       Employers often require potential hirees to provide references from their former employers. Such references may serve as a basis for the prospective employer to assess the applicant’s character and abilities, and will likely have at least some, if not significant, bearing on the applicant’s chances of obtaining employment. For this and other reasons, which we will elaborate upon in the course of this judgment, it is important that employers prepare such references, when called upon to do so, in a fair and accurate manner to avoid unjustifiably prejudicing the former employee’s prospects of obtaining fresh employment. Before us, it was accepted that an employer has a duty of care when preparing such a reference. The dispute turned on whether that duty had been breached, which in turn depended on the 
standard
 of care that must be exercised by an employer in the preparation of such references. This issue has not hitherto been considered by this court.
2       The appellant, Mr Ramesh s/o Krishnan (“the Appellant”), argues that the respondent, his former principal, AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd (“the Respondent”), breached the duty of care which it owed him in the preparation of references that had been requested by his prospective employers, Prudential Assurance Company Singapore Pte Ltd (“Prudential”) and Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore Limited (“Tokio Marine”). He contends that as a result of this, he was not employed by either of them. In his decision reported as 
Ramesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd
 
[2015] 4 SLR 1
 (“the Judgment”), the High Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissed the Appellant’s claim on the basis that the Respondent had not breached its duty of care.
3       Two questions arise in this appeal: (a) whether the Respondent breached its duty of care to the Appellant in the preparation of the references; and (b) if the Respondent did indeed breach its duty, whether this breach 
caused
 the Appellant not to be employed by the two prospective employers. Having considered the matter, we answer both questions affirmatively in respect of the claim concerning the Appellant’s application to join Prudential (but not the claim concerning his application to join Tokio Marine – see [108] below), and allow the appeal to that extent. We now explain our decision in detail, but preface our analysis with an overview of the regulatory framework of the financial advisory and insurance industry and a summary of the material facts.
Regulatory framework of the financial advisory and insurance industry
4       As the references in question were provided pursuant to regulations that are specific to the financial advisory and insurance industry, a brief understanding of the regulatory framework of the industry is necessary in order to understand what actually transpired.
5       The Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) has in place a framework to ensure that financial advisers and other persons who carry out regulated activities under the Financial Advisers Act (Cap 110, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the FAA”) and the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) are fit and proper persons who will perform such activities (“Regulated Activities”) efficiently, honestly, fairly and in the best interests of consumers. In this context, one of the measures taken by MAS was the establishment of the “Representative Notification Framework” (“RNF”) in November 2010. Under the RNF, financial institutions that are regulated by MAS are required to notify and to obtain a licence (“RNF licence”) from MAS before they may appoint a representative to carry out any Regulated Activities. They are also required to conduct due diligence checks into the background of the proposed representative. This includes conducting reference checks with the proposed representative’s former employer or principal in order to establish that the proposed representative does meet the standards prescribed in the FAA as well as under a set of guidelines issued by MAS (namely, the Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria (Guideline No FSG-G01)). In particular, financial institutions are required to inquire from the proposed representative’s former employer or principal whether he has any adverse record (such as warnings, reprimands or other disciplinary action for misconduct), or whether he has ever been dismissed or asked to resign.
6       Apart from requiring financial institutions to perform reference checks with the proposed representative’s former employer or principal, MAS also requires them to obtain a declaration from the proposed representative that he does satisfy MAS’s Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria. Where a proposed representative has indicated any adverse information in the self-declaration, the financial institution must obtain details from him and then assess whether he may nonetheless be considered fit and proper to be appointed, and if so, explain why.
7       The RNF is supplemented by a scheme known as the “Industry Reference Check System”, which predates the RNF but was improved thereafter. The Industry Reference Check System is an industry-led initiative started in October 2006 by various trade and professional associations in Singapore, including the Life Insurance Association of Singapore (“LIA”), which is an association of life insurance providers based in Singapore and licensed by MAS. The Respondent, Tokio Marine and Prudential are all members of the LIA. The Industry Reference Check System serves as a standardised reference checking system across the different sectors of the financial advisory and insurance industry. It was launched to facilitate the efforts of financial institutions to comply with MAS’s guidelines and to allow them to better assess persons applying for jobs that involve Regulated Activities. This initiative is endorsed by MAS. Financial institutions that are regulated by MAS and are members of the LIA have the following two obligations under the Industry Reference Check System:
(a)     Before they appoint a representative, they are required to conduct reference checks with the applicant’s former employer or principal through the use of a standardised form known as the “Industry Reference Check Form” (“Reference Check Form”).
(b)     Correspondingly, when they are approached by another institution operating under the system for reference checks on their former employee or agent, they are required to respond in a timely and forthcoming manner. The usual timeline for the return of a Reference Check Form is seven working days.
8       The Reference Check Form plays an important role under both the RNF and the Industry Reference Check System, and is pertinent to the present appeal because it was the format in which the main references in question were provided. There is strong encouragement for financial institutions to use the Reference Check Form, even though they are not legally obliged to do so. The form, as revised by the LIA in August 2011, consists of two sections:
(a)     Section A, titled “Minimum Information (compulsory)”, in which the former employer or principal is 
obliged
 to furnish basic information such as the applicant’s period of employment, the reason for his departure, whether he has ever been reported to MAS for any misconduct under the relevant legislation, the last position which he held with the former employer or principal and the contact details of a person in the former employer or principal who may be approached for further information or clarification; and
(b)     Section B, titled “Optional Information”, an open-ended section in which the former employer or principal 
may
 provide any other information that it deems relevant. The guidelines on the use of the Reference Check Form state that the prospective employer may request more information under Section B, such as information on the applicant’s “Production in the last 12 months” and his “Persistency Ratio in the last calendar year”.
9       It is apposite here to explain the concept of “persistency ratios” (also known as “persistency rates”), which, as will become apparent, feature significantly in the present appeal. Persistency ratios track the number of insurance policies sold by an adviser that are still in force over a period of time (for example, a financial institution may track a 13-month period, a 19-month period or a 24-month period). There are a number of different formulae for calculating persistency ratios, and these may take into account not only the number of policies that have lapsed over a given period, but also the amount of premiums lost on account of the lapsing of policies and the amount of premiums gained by the addition of new policies. Some of the possible differences between the various methods of calculation and between the ratios that are derived by using particular methods are discussed at [116] below. Persistency ratios are almost always sought and included in reference checks. These ratios help to shed light on the 
quality
 of an adviser’s sales: a high ratio indicates that many of the adviser’s clients have continued to maintain their policies during the relevant period of time and suggests that the adviser’s sales are of a good quality.
10     For completeness, we should mention that the Reference Check Form has two other parts: (a) a part where the applicant is to give his written authority for his prospective employer to make inquiries into his previous employment; and (b) a set of guidelines on the use of the form.
11     Against that backdrop, we turn to the factual narrative.
The material facts
The Appellant’s relationship with the Respondent
12     The Appellant was engaged by the Respondent as an adviser and financial services associate manager on 26 July 2005. Prior to that, he worked as an insurance agent at John Hancock Financial (which later merged with Manulife Financial) and thereafter at Philips Securities. In the course of the requisite reference checks that were conducted when the Appellant applied to join the Respondent, the Respondent discovered that his former principals had terminated his services because of his poor persistency rate and “extensive [c]ompliance record”. The Respondent nevertheless decided to engage the Appellant, but placed him under strict supervision during the initial period. The Respondent was also required to respond to MAS’s inquiries into the performance and conduct of the Appellant until September 2006.
13     The Appellant’s performance must have been satisfactory because he was not only retained by the Respondent, but also promoted. On 1 January 2007, he was appointed a financial services director and started leading a group of advisers under his own “agency organisation”, known as “the Ramesh Organisation”, within the Respondent. In this capacity, the Appellant had to recruit, train and supervise advisers for the Respondent, and assess the sales figures and persistency ratios of the advisers under him. The Appellant was promoted again in 2009 to the position of a senior financial services director. He also won numerous awards in the course of the five-odd years that he was with the Respondent.
14     The Appellant was not an employee of the Respondent, even though the manner in which he was recruited and the promotions that he received might suggest this. It was made clear in his appointment letter and promotion contracts that he was not an employee, but was instead an agent authorised to act for the Respondent for the purposes of soliciting and advising on life insurance applications and other products; he also received commissions from policies sold by advisers in the Ramesh Organisation (referred to hereafter as “Ramesh Organisation advisers” where appropriate to the context). As we explain at [59] below, the fact that the Appellant was an 
agent
, and not an employee, of the Respondent does not make a difference in these proceedings. In particular, this does not make a difference in respect of the duty of care that the Respondent owed the Appellant in its preparation of the references.
Events leading to the Appellant’s resignation
15     From late 2010, the parties’ relationship started to deteriorate. This began when the Appellant realised that the advisers in the Ramesh Organisation might not be in the running to receive the awards and incentives which the Respondent gave out annually to its top performers. This was apparently the consequence of a change in the assessment criteria.
16     For various reasons, the Ramesh Organisation had focused predominantly on regular premium policies instead of single premium policies since the beginning of 2010. Regular premium policies are those for which the policyholder pays premiums throughout the life of the policy, while single premium policies are those where, as the name suggests, the policyholder pays one premium at the start of the period of cover. The Appellant describes single premium policies as being more akin to financial investments. According to the Appellant, because of this, the persistency ratio for single premium policies tends to be more volatile as policyholders will typically cash out these policies to realise the profit when market conditions are favourable. The Appellant asserts that the Respondent’s then chief executive officer (“CEO”), Mr Gilbert Pak (“Mr Pak”), had assured him in February 2010 that the Respondent was agreeable to taking into account only the persistency ratio in respect of 
regular
 premium policies when assessing the eligibility of Ramesh Organisation advisers for incentives and awards in the event that their persistency ratio in respect of 
single
 premium products dropped as a result of the organisation’s shift in focus. On this assurance, the Ramesh Organisation had focused on regular premium products.
17     The Appellant claims that the Respondent’s position changed in December 2010 when Mr Pak was replaced by Mr Glenn John Williams (“Mr Williams”), who decided that the persistency ratios for both types of policies were to be taken into account when assessing the Respondent’s best performers. This caused unhappiness among the members of the Ramesh Organisation because their chances of garnering awards and incentives stood to be adversely affected. Relying on Mr Pak’s previous assurance, the Appellant tried to negotiate with Mr Williams and the Respondent’s senior management, but was not successful. This prompted the Appellant and a large number of advisers in the Ramesh Organisation to contemplate resigning in January 2011, but they were successfully persuaded otherwise by the Respondent’s senior management, which, according to the Appellant, made many overtures to him, including promising a separate category of awards for his advisers and a generous remuneration package for him.
18     Matters then took an about-turn on 29 April 2011. After apparently hearing that the Appellant and many of his advisers were going to collectively resign at the annual dinner-and-dance function which was to be held that evening, Mr Williams cancelled all the tables that had been reserved for them and barred them from attending the event. The Appellant was also served with a letter of termination. Despite the Appellant’s pleas and assurances that the rumours were unfounded, Mr Williams refused to reconsider his decision. He agreed, however, to allow the Appellant to resign instead on the condition that he did so before 1.00pm on the same day. The Appellant complied.
The Appellant’s application to join Prudential
19     Shortly after he resigned from the Respondent, the Appellant applied to join Prudential.
The Reference Check Form submitted to Prudential
20     On 21 May 2011, Prudential sent a reference check request to the Respondent using the Reference Check Form pursuant to the RNF and the Industry Reference Check System. The Respondent sent the completed Reference Check Form back to Prudential on 7 June 2011 (we will hereafter refer to this completed form as “the Prudential Reference Check Form”).
21     In Section A of the Prudential Reference Check Form, the Respondent stated that the Appellant had left voluntarily. It also indicated, by the annotation “N/A”, that he had never been reported to MAS for misconduct under any of the applicable regulations.
22     In Section B, instead of replying directly to the questions posed by Prudential regarding the Appellant’s “Production in the last 12 months”, the “Termination Code” and his “Persistency Ratio in the last calendar year”, the Respondent attached an annex containing the following information:
…
 
2. Ramesh s/o Krishnan Organisation Persistency (as of 30 April 2011)
 
19mth Single Premium persistency = 43%
13mth Regular Premium persistency = 39.6%
 
3. Compliance Issues
 
Between 2008 to 2011, 14 Advisers under [the Ramesh Organisation] were investigated (including [the Appellant]).
 •     Disciplinary actions were taken against 5 advisers
 •     3 cases were referred to the Police for further investigation
23     Two things in this reference are notable for the purposes of the Appellant’s claim:
(a)     the Respondent’s decision to use the 13-month measure instead of the 19-month measure in respect of 
regular
 premium policies; and
(b)     the mention of “[c]ompliance [i]ssues” in respect of the Appellant and a number of advisers in the Ramesh Organisation. Save for the assertions that these investigations and disciplinary measures had been carried out, no further details were provided.
Clarifications sought by Prudential from the Respondent and the Appellant
24     The information provided in the Prudential Reference Check Form prompted Prudential, as it was required to do under the RNF, to seek clarification and further information from the Respondent. Specifically, on 7 June 2011, the very day that it received the form, Prudential asked the Respondent for the names of the 14 Ramesh Organisation advisers who had been investigated and of the three advisers whose cases had been referred to the police for further investigation; it also asked for the details, reasons and outcome of the investigations. Through its Compliance Manager at the material time, Mr Jack Ng (“Mr Ng”), the Respondent replied the next day (8 June 2011) stating that its usual practice was not to disclose information on advisers who were not the subject of a reference check request, and thus, it could only provide the details of the investigations on the Appellant. A day later, on 9 June 2011, the Respondent sent Prudential those details by email in the following terms:
An investigation was conducted on [the Appellant] in August 2011 on unprofessional conduct – rude and aggressive in his approach. (Finding: Inconclusive evidence to substantiate the allegation, no action was taken)
25     On 16 June 2011, Prudential made the Appellant an offer of employment with a 24-month financial package, subject to several conditions, including the successful clearance of his reference check and his fulfilment of the “Fitness and Propriety” requirements under MAS’s Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria. The conditional offer was valid for a month.
26     After making the conditional offer, Prudential continued to seek clarification from the Respondent on the information provided by the latter in the Prudential Reference Check Form. On 21 June 2011, Prudential sent the Respondent an email asking for three pieces of information: (a) the method by which it had calculated the persistency ratios that it furnished Prudential; (b) the outcome of the three cases that had been referred to the police for further investigation; and (c) updates on the Appellant.
27     When Prudential did not receive a reply from the Respondent after some time, it turned to the Appellant for clarification. He was invited to provide more information on the persistency ratios and the compliance issues that had been highlighted in the Prudential Reference Check Form. The Appellant executed a statutory declaration on 11 July 2011, in which he made the following points:
(a)     The persistency ratios of the Ramesh Organisation had always been good and had always been at least 80%.
(b)     There had been no complaints against him while he was with the Respondent, save for a minor complaint by a client’s brother. This unsubstantiated complaint was later dismissed by the Respondent.
(c)     Out of the more than 150 advisers and personnel who were under him throughout his time with the Respondent, he was only aware that: (i) one of them had his services terminated; (ii) two others were refused their RNF licence due to “offences” that had been committed before they joined the industry; and (iii) four others were issued with letters of warning.
(d)     He was never informed, and had no knowledge, that his advisers had ever been referred to the police for wrongdoing. He had previously advised the clients of two of his advisers to lodge a police report against those advisers for suspected wrongdoing, but neither the clients nor the Respondent had proceeded to take any action as far as he was aware.
It should be noted that while the Appellant might have wished, by furnishing this statutory declaration, to address the concerns that Prudential might have had arising from the information provided by the Respondent in the Prudential Reference Check Form, he had no knowledge of the exact contents of the form as it had not been shown to him.
28     After about a month without receiving a reply from the Respondent, Prudential sent the Respondent another email on 18 July 2011 explaining that it wished to know how the persistency ratios provided by the Respondent had been calculated because the ratios reported in the Prudential Reference Check Form differed greatly from those provided by the Appellant. Mr Ng again informed the representative from Prudential that the Respondent could not provide the details of advisers who were not the subject of Prudential’s reference check request. It does not appear that Mr Ng responded to Prudential’s query about the method used to compute the persistency ratios.
29     Approximately three months later, on 14 October 2011, Mr Williams sent a letter to Prudential’s CEO with a copy to MAS. That letter (“the 14 October Letter”) read as follows:
…
 
High Number of Lapsed / Surrendered Policies
 
Our records show that your organisation had requested for [a] reference check on [the Appellant] … We would like to bring to your attention that [the] Ramesh Organisation showed a very poor 13
th
 month persistency rate of 
9.0%
.
Based on our observations of notable trends [on] the lapsing and surrendering of policies, we have strong reason to believe that the ex-advisers in [the] Ramesh Organisation have been involved in [the] twisting of clients’ policies. We are very concerned as to whether the clients have been provided
with proper advice or [whether] any improper switching/replacement practices [have been] carried out by the ex-advisers which are detrimental to [the] clients’ interests.
[emphasis in bold in original]
“Twisting” is a term used to describe the situation where a policyholder is persuaded to allow an existing policy to lapse, only to enter into a new policy on similar terms.
30     According to Mr Williams, the 14 October Letter was sent because he had learnt sometime in September or October 2011 that the persistency ratios of the Ramesh Organisation had “dropped even further than what had been stated in [the Prudential Reference Check Form] in June 2011”, and thus took the view that it was necessary to update Prudential “so that [Prudential] would not unwittingly be involved in [the] improper switching of policies”.
31     A few things stand out in the 14 October Letter:
(a)     Even though Prudential had twice asked the Respondent 
how
 it calculated persistency rates and had even noted that the figures which it reported were at odds with those reported by the Appellant, the Respondent did not address this issue at all in the letter.
(b)     The letter reports an even lower persistency ratio for the Ramesh Organisation, but does not explain how this was derived, which period it pertained to, whether it was for single or regular premium policies and why it differed from the earlier ratios provided to Prudential in June 2011.
(c)     The letter expresses opinions and suspicions adverse to the Appellant, and is suggestive of unethical practices that were detrimental to the interests of clients.
Correspondence between MAS and the Respondent
32     Even before receiving the 14 October Letter, Prudential had, on 12 August 2011, made an application for a RNF licence (“RNF Licence Application”) for the Appellant from MAS. On submitting its application, Prudential received an acknowledgement email stating that it “should hear from [MAS] within the next 7 to 14 days”.
33     Pursuant to a subpoena by the Appellant, Mr Wong Bo Sheng (“Mr Wong”), who previously worked at MAS and was involved in handling Prudential’s RNF Licence Application, testified at the trial below. His evidence was, however, limited because most of the relevant documents and details were protected by official communications privilege pursuant to s 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). It should therefore be noted that we are making reference to matters concerning MAS without the benefit of all the evidence on the totality of the events.
34     Prudential did not hear from MAS within the indicated timeframe. Instead, in October 2011, more than two months after Prudential’s RNF Licence Application was submitted, MAS sought information from the Respondent about the Appellant’s resignation. It seems, at least as a matter of inference, that its inquiries were prompted by the 14 October Letter, which had been copied to it (see [29] above).
35     In particular, MAS wanted to know why the Respondent had allowed the Appellant to resign rather than terminate his services. The Respondent explained that this was because it had no proof that the persistency ratio of the Ramesh Organisation would be as poor as it had suspected. MAS then inquired further on 7 November 2011 whether the Respondent had any other reasons for wanting to terminate the Appellant’s services. The Respondent replied to MAS in an email on 9 November 2011 stating as follows:
...
Persistency was the main concern although we were also worried about the general culture of [the Ramesh Organisation]. The culture seemed to be overly sales orientated e.g. [the Appellant] had a high number of managers who had faced disciplinary action over the previous years’ [
sic
] the average productivity of his advisers seemed to be very much higher than we would expect, potentially indicating gaming of compensation. We felt that he “sailed very close to the wind” and ultimately crossed the line. We believe the fact that his persistency has fallen to ONLY 9% supports our view and intuition at the time.
In this email, a number of opinions adverse to the Appellant and suggestive of ethical violations were once again expressed. Moreover, the impression conveyed was that the Ramesh Organisation led by the Appellant, as a whole, had a poor understanding of, and lacked commitment to, proper industry practices. This email was not copied to the Appellant.
The outcome of Prudential’s RNF Licence Application
36     Concerned that Prudential’s RNF Licence Application had been pending for an exceptionally long time, the Appellant approached the chairman of MAS, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and his Member of Parliament, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean (“DPM Teo”), for assistance in October 2011. The Appellant was concerned because at around the same time that Prudential submitted its application, similar applications had been made on behalf of other advisers who had previously worked under him, and those applications had already been approved. (It is unclear from the evidence whether those applications were likewise made by Prudential or made by other firms.)
37     On 6 December 2011, MAS replied to the Appellant, but did not inform him of the outcome of Prudential’s RNF Licence Application. In its letter, it: (a) emphasised that financial institutions were required to ensure that the persons whom they recruited to conduct Regulated Activities were fit and proper; (b) stated that it understood that Prudential had explained to the Appellant the reasons for its delay in getting back to him; and (c) asked the Appellant to check directly with Prudential on matters relating to the RNF.
38     Eventually, on a date unknown to the parties but sometime between 9 November and 15 December 2011, MAS informed Prudential that it was prepared to issue a conditional RNF licence to the Appellant. MAS indicated that conditions had to be imposed because the information that had been brought to its attention in relation to the Appellant’s working relationship with the Respondent had “raised several issues of concern”, including: (a) the “low group persistency and high lapse rate” of the Ramesh Organisation; and (b) the fact that several Ramesh Organisation advisers had been “disciplined” by the Respondent for “issues such as improper sales practices and unprofessional conduct”. The details of the conditions stipulated by MAS were not disclosed in these proceedings.
39     Prudential informed MAS on 15 December 2011 that it did not wish to proceed with its RNF Licence Application. It is unclear when the Appellant was made aware of this development. He was not officially informed by MAS of this until more than eight months later on 31 August 2012 after he again sought assistance from DPM Teo (see [48]–[49] below).
The Appellant’s application to join Tokio Marine
40     On or around 18 January 2012, the Appellant applied to Tokio Marine for a job as a financial adviser as it was evident by then that his application to join Prudential was unlikely to succeed. His anticipated role at Tokio Marine was considerably less senior than his role with the Respondent.
41     The contents of the completed Reference Check Form that the Respondent sent to Tokio Marine on 20 January 2012 were materially similar to those of the Prudential Reference Check Form (see [21]–[22] above). As in the case of the latter form, the Appellant was not aware of the contents of the Reference Check Form which the Respondent sent to Tokio Marine as he was not extended a copy.
42     Towards the end of February 2012, Tokio Marine asked the Appellant for more information on why he had been investigated and why three of his advisers had been referred to the police. After asking Mr Williams for more information as he had no recollection of the investigations even though he said he was in the habit of keeping records, the Appellant replied to Tokio Marine on 10 April 2012.
43     Tokio Marine also approached the Respondent for more information on the compliance issues mentioned in the latter’s reference check response. Mr Ng drafted the following reply and sent it to Mr Williams for approval:
 
… AXA’s [proposed] response
 
[The Appellant] was investigated in June 2010 for unprofessional conduct (being rude and aggressive) based on a client’s brother[’s] complaint. In view of the inconclusive evidence to substantiate the allegation, no action was taken against [the Appellant].
Between 2008 to 2011, there were disciplinary actions taken against 5 advisers under [the Ramesh Organisation]. During the same period, there were also 3 cases involving 3 advisers under [the Ramesh Organisation] that were referred to the Police for further investigation.
44     Mr Williams replied to Mr Ng as follows:
 
We need to be much stronger than this.
 
We need to mention [the Appellant’s] very poor persistency. For the 5 disciplinary cases if any of these are bad we should highlight those [cases].
I would also suggest that we add ‘we recommend that [Tokio Marine’s CEO] phone [the Respondent’s CEO], Glenn Williams, for more details on this case.’
[emphasis added]
45     After receiving Mr Williams’ instructions, Mr Ng included in the Respondent’s response to Tokio Marine the detail that the Ramesh Organisation’s persistency ratio as at the end of 2012 was 11.22% and the suggestion that Tokio Marine’s CEO telephone Mr Williams for further details. He did not, however, highlight any adverse details of the five cases involving disciplinary action against Ramesh Organisation advisers, evidently because the Respondent’s usual practice, as indicated above, was not to provide details concerning advisers who were not the subject of the reference check request in question.
46     It is evident from the internal correspondence between Mr Ng and Mr Williams set out at [43]–[44] above that Mr Williams was bent on conveying an adverse impression of the Appellant and the Ramesh Organisation. To that end, he wanted the Ramesh Organisation’s persistency rates to be highlighted together with any adverse details of the five disciplinary cases against Ramesh Organisation advisers, especially if any of those cases were “bad”, 
even though
 Tokio Marine had not sought such information.
47     It is unclear when or why Tokio Marine decided not to hire the Appellant. According to the Appellant, he was told by two representatives from Tokio Marine sometime in June or July 2012 that the company had decided not to proceed with his job application “because someone had written something about [him]”. It appears that Tokio Marine did not even embark on the process of applying to MAS for a RNF licence for the Appellant.
MAS’s formal reply to the Appellant regarding Prudential’s RNF Licence Application 
48     After receiving news that his application to join Tokio Marine had also failed, the Appellant sought assistance from DPM Teo again in July 2012 as he was exasperated and worried that he would no longer be able to work in the financial advisory and insurance industry, given how his job applications to Prudential and Tokio Marine had turned out.
49     DPM Teo wrote to MAS on the Appellant’s behalf to make further representations in respect of the RNF Licence Application that Prudential had submitted the year before in August 2011. As mentioned at [39] above, MAS wrote to the Appellant on 31 August 2012. The relevant part of the letter reads:
…
3    … Based on information that had been brought to our attention in relation to your previous employment with [the Respondent], the information raised several issues of concern, including:
(i)    Your former agency unit, [the] Ramesh Organisation, had a low group persistency and high lapse rate; and
(ii)   Several of your agents were disciplined by [the Respondent] for issues such as improper sales practices and unprofessional conduct.
 
In view of these concerns
, MAS conveyed to Prudential that MAS was prepared to accept its application for you to be its representative subject to conditions to be imposed on Prudential with respect to your provision of financial advisory services as its representative. Subsequently on 15 December 2011, MAS was informed by Prudential of the withdrawal of its application for you to be notified as its representative.
4    We hope that clarifies MAS’ position on the matter of your appointment as a representative. …
…
[emphasis added]
The Appellant asserts that he was not aware MAS had these concerns until he received this letter.
The Judge’s decision
50     On 30 November 2012, the Appellant commenced a suit against the Respondent founded on three causes of action: defamation, malicious falsehood and negligence. The Judge dismissed all three claims. As the Appellant has appealed only against the Judge’s decision in respect of the negligence claim, we will not address the other two claims in this judgment.
51     The Judge found that the Respondent owed a duty to the Appellant to take reasonable care in responding to Prudential, Tokio Marine and MAS, but held that the Respondent had not breached that duty. He found that the statements on persistency rates in the information provided by the Respondent were accurate and supported by evidence, and that contrary to the Appellant’s assertion, the 13-month measure of persistency, which was the measure used in respect of regular premium policies handled by the Ramesh Organisation (see [22] above), had not been invented by the Respondent in order to prejudice the Appellant, but had in fact been introduced to its advisers, including the Appellant, at a workshop held on 8 March 2011. As for the statements pertaining to the compliance issues, the Judge found that those statements had not been carelessly made and were true. He also held that while the information given by the Respondent might not have been complete in that the outcome of the investigations into the Appellant and the Ramesh Organisation advisers concerned had not been provided, the Respondent did subsequently inform Prudential and Tokio Marine that no further action had been taken against the Appellant because of insufficient evidence.
52     The Judge further observed that in any event, the Appellant’s claim would likely have failed even if the Respondent had been found to have breached its duty of care because causation appeared not to have been established. In this regard, he observed that upon, and despite, receiving the reference check response from the Respondent, Prudential had gone ahead to apply for a RNF licence for the Appellant and had obtained a conditional licence from MAS. It was for reasons known only to Prudential, and which appeared to have nothing to do with the Respondent or the information that it had provided to Prudential, that Prudential later decided not to hire the Appellant. As for Tokio Marine, the Judge noted that the evidence suggested that the company took into account various factors in deciding not to hire the Appellant, of which the reference check response from the Respondent was only one. He was thus of the view that it was questionable whether the Respondent’s conduct had 
caused
 the Appellant not to be employed by Tokio Marine.
The parties’ respective cases on appeal
The Appellant’s case
53     The Appellant argues that the Judge erred in: (a) finding that the Respondent had not breached its duty of care to him; and (b) thinking that there was no causal link between the Respondent’s conduct and his failure to secure a job with either Prudential or Tokio Marine. He raises the following arguments in respect of the finding that there was no breach of duty on the Respondent’s part:
(a)     The Judge erred in failing to define the applicable standard of care. The standard of care owed by the Respondent required it to provide information that was prepared carefully and judiciously.
(b)     The information provided by the Respondent to Prudential, Tokio Marine and MAS was neither complete nor accurate. First, the Respondent omitted to mention the Appellant’s achievements and emphasised only the allegedly negative aspects of his performance. Second, the persistency ratios that were provided gave an inaccurate and incomplete picture, and suggested that the Appellant was an incompetent senior financial services director. The Judge should not have focused only on the accuracy of the figures or on the fact that the Respondent had subsequently provided all the relevant information to Prudential and Tokio Marine.
(c)     The Respondent had acted in bad faith in providing incomplete and inaccurate information to the Appellant’s potential employers.
54     With regard to the Judge’s observation that there did not appear to be any causal link between the Respondent’s conduct and the Appellant’s failure to secure a job with either Prudential or Tokio Marine, the Appellant contends that in respect of his application to join Prudential, the Respondent’s breach had a material impact on MAS’s decision to issue only a conditional RNF licence to him. Further, Prudential eventually decided not to hire him because the process of clearing his job application had become “too long-drawn”, and this was a consequence of the Respondent’s negligence in preparing its reference check response to Prudential. As for his application to join Tokio Marine, the Appellant argues that the Respondent’s reference check response caused Tokio Marine to have the impression that he had compliance issues, which eventually led to Tokio Marine’s decision not to hire him.
The Respondent’s case
55     The Respondent, on the other hand, relies on the following arguments to submit that the Judge correctly found that it had not breached its duty of care to the Appellant:
(a)     The applicable standard of care must be determined in the light of the regulatory framework that financial institutions are subject to. In this case, the standard of care would have been met as long as the Respondent had exercised reasonable care and skill in providing information that was relevant for the Appellant’s prospective employers to conduct the necessary probity checks pursuant to the Industry Reference Check System and the RNF.
(b)     The Respondent was not required to provide a full and comprehensive report on all facts concerning the Appellant, including his positive aspects and achievements. Such a requirement was contrary to the objective of the regulatory framework and would unfairly burden those in the industry.
(c)     The persistency ratios that were provided by the Respondent were factually true and accurate.
(d)     Whether the Respondent had acted in bad faith was irrelevant to whether it had breached its duty of care to the Appellant. Negligence and bad faith were separate issues, and in any event, the Judge was correct in finding that the Respondent had not acted in bad faith.
56     The Respondent also submits that there was no causal link between its conduct and the eventual decisions of Prudential and Tokio Marine not to engage the Appellant. It further argues that the Appellant failed to prove that he suffered any loss because: (a) the 24-month financial package which the Appellant claims he was offered by Prudential had not been finalised; and (b) since 19 May 2011 (shortly after resigning from the Respondent), the Appellant has been involved in another business that he jointly owns with his wife (namely, a vegetarian restaurant), contrary to his assertion that he has not been able to find reasonable alternative employment.
The issues on appeal
57     Broadly, three issues fall to be determined in this appeal:
(a)     What is the standard of care expected of a former employer or principal in its preparation of a reference for a former employee or agent?
(b)     Has the Respondent breached its duty of care to the Appellant?
(c)     If so, has causation been made out?
We address each issue in turn.
The applicable standard of care
58     Before we undertake an analysis of the applicable standard of care, we first endorse the Judge’s finding, together with his detailed analysis (at [230]–[280] of the Judgment), that employers do owe a duty of care to their employees (be it former or present) in the preparation of references. In our judgment, the Judge correctly took into account the factors considered by the House of Lords in 
Spring v Guardian Assurance plc and others
 
[1995] 2 AC 296
 (“
Spring (HL)
”) within the framework set out in 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 in finding that such a duty of care exists.
59     We should add that it does not make a difference that the Appellant was an 
agent
 rather than an employee of the Respondent. As noted by the Judge at [250] of the Judgment, the factors that led to his finding that an employer owes its employee a duty of care in preparing a reference for him are also present in the context of the relationship between some principals and agents, such as that between the Respondent and the Appellant. This was also the view of the House of Lords in 
Spring (HL)
: see Lord Goff’s observations at 321 and Lord Woolf’s observations at 340–341. We thus use the terms “employer” and “principal” interchangeably in this judgment. Further, we also agree with the Judge’s finding (at [253]–[254] of the Judgment) that such a duty of care is owed not only by a current employer, but also by a 
former
 employer.
60     To determine whether the Respondent has breached its duty of care to the Appellant, it is necessary to first consider what the standard of care expected of the Respondent is. As this issue has not previously been considered by this court, we start by reviewing the principles set out in the English cases.
The standard of care as analysed by the English courts
61      
Spring (HL)
 is often regarded as the first case in which it was held that an employee has a cause of action in negligence against an employer who provides a reference that, although unfavourable and inaccurate, falls short of being defamatory. But in fact, about eight years before the House of Lords’ judgment in 
Spring (HL)
, the English High Court in 
Lawton v BOC Transhield Ltd
 [1987] IRLR 404 (“
Lawton
”) had already held that an employer owes a duty of care to its employee to ensure that the opinions contained in an employment reference are based on accurate facts. The court in 
Lawton
 did not discuss whether the imposition of liability for negligence would subvert the protection which had hitherto been regarded as being within the province of the law of defamation (that issue was subsequently carefully analysed by the House of Lords in 
Spring (HL)
). Notwithstanding this, the English High Court’s observations in 
Lawton
 on the applicable standard of care remain helpful for our purposes.
The decision in 
Lawton
62     The plaintiff in 
Lawton
, Mr John Arthur Lawton (“Mr Lawton”), worked for the defendant, BOC Transhield Ltd (“BOC”), for ten years, mostly as a driver, until he was retrenched because he did not wish to be transferred to another depot when the depot which he was working at closed permanently. After his retrenchment, Mr Lawton was employed by Cadbury Schweppes on a probationary basis. When Cadbury Schweppes considered him for a permanent position, it requested a reference from BOC.
63     BOC wrote a poor reference for Mr Lawton, in which it said that it would not re-employ him. It later explained in its further communications with Cadbury Schweppes that this was because Mr Lawton had been abusive and threatening to his superiors, was a poor timekeeper as compared to his peers, had a poor attendance record, had a poor health record, was unreliable and had poor driving ability. Cadbury Schweppes subsequently dismissed Mr Lawton, who thereafter remained unemployed for about two years. Mr Lawton sued BOC for causing him economic loss arising from its alleged negligence in providing the reference to Cadbury Schweppes.
64     Tudor Evans J dismissed Mr Lawton’s claim as he found that the reference given to Cadbury Schweppes had been honest and accurate, and had not been negligently prepared (at [58]). His judgment is helpful because it articulates the standard of care that is expected of a reasonable employer when writing a reference. He held that there was no obligation for employers to give references, and that they were always entitled to refuse to give one. But, if they chose to provide references, they were obliged to take reasonable care to ensure that the opinions which they expressed were based on accurate facts. The test, he held, was whether a reasonably prudent employer, on the facts as found, would have expressed the opinions which were stated in the reference.
The decisions in 
Spring (HC)
 and 
Spring (HL)
65     Further observations on the applicable standard of care were subsequently made by both the English High Court and the House of Lords in the decisions that culminated in 
Spring (HL)
. The English High Court’s decision is reported as 
Spring v Guardian Assurance plc and others
 [1992] IRLR 173 (“
Spring (HC)
”).
66     The facts in 
Spring (HC)
 are similar to those in the present case, in that both concern the financial services industry. By way of background, financial institutions in the United Kingdom are required to adhere to the rules of a statutory body, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (we hereafter refer to this organisation as “LAUTRO” and to its rules as “the LAUTRO Rules”). Similar to the position in Singapore, the LAUTRO Rules require financial institutions to first obtain references from a potential hiree’s former employer in order to ensure that he is a “fit and proper” person to be employed in the financial services industry.
67     Mr Spring, the plaintiff, was employed by one of the defendants, a small estate and insurance agency known as “Corinium”, to sell insurance policies. Corinium was in turn an agent of a British insurance company, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance plc (“GRE”). Mr Spring was also a company representative of GRE. Eventually, GRE became the major shareholder of Corinium and appointed one Mr Siderfin to be Corinium’s CEO. Mr Siderfin did not get along with Mr Spring, and dismissed him without explanation less than a month after assuming office. The decision to dismiss Mr Spring might also have been the consequence of rumours that he was intending to join a competitor. After he was dismissed, Mr Spring applied to join Scottish Amicable (“Scottish”), which sought a character reference from GRE. GRE stated as follows in the reference which it provided (see 
Spring (HC)
 at [25]):
Mr Spring held the position of sales manager until he was asked to leave in August of this year. His former superior has stated in writing that he was seen by some of the sales staff as a person who consistently kept the best leads for himself with little regard for the sales team that he was supposedly to manage; and his former superior has further stated that he is a man 
of little or no integrity and could not be regarded as honest
.
… [W]e have found a serious case of mis-selling where the concept of “best advice” was ignored and the policies sold which yielded the highest commissions. GRE personnel had to visit the investor to rectify the situation. There have been other cases where there has been bad advice but there is no current evidence to indicate whether this was deliberate or through ignorance.
[emphasis added]
As a result of this reference, Scottish declined to hire Mr Spring, who later also failed to be hired by two other insurance companies. Mr Spring sought damages from GRE and Corinium for economic loss.
68     The “serious case of mis-selling” stated in the reference provided by GRE referred to a transaction that had been executed by Mr Spring while he was working for Corinium. That transaction was the largest which Mr Spring had ever executed and involved the investment of £170,000 on behalf of a client, Mr Fennell. Mr Spring proposed that most of the money be invested in policies with GRE. However, those policies were inappropriate for Mr Fennell and would have caused him significant financial losses. At the same time, Mr Spring would have benefitted from large commission payments. Other staff discovered the matter before Mr Spring’s proposal was accepted by GRE, and steps were taken to rectify the situation. It was disputed whether Mr Spring had made the recommendation out of incompetence or with the motive of generating the highest possible commission for himself.
69     Mr Lever QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court, allowed Mr Spring’s claim in negligence and agreed with his counsel that the reference provided by GRE had been so “strikingly bad” that it could aptly be described as a “kiss of death” to Mr Spring’s career in insurance (at [2]). He found that in the case concerning Mr Fennell, Mr Spring had acted incompetently, but not dishonestly with the object of securing a substantial commission for himself, and that this would have been clear to GRE if it had carried out a proper inquiry into the case instead of simply concluding that Mr Spring must have been dishonest because no one could have been so incompetent as to make such a mistake (at [147]). Mr Lever held that GRE should have been careful and judicious in its preparation of the reference. He held that Mr Siderfin, whose input was relied on for the preparation of the reference, had been prejudiced against Mr Spring, and this had caused him to “play fast and loose” with the facts (at [158]). He found GRE to be in breach of its duty of care to Mr Spring because even if it believed the statement which it made in the reference about Mr Spring’s lack of honesty and integrity, it had made that statement without first undertaking a careful assessment of Mr Spring’s qualities, and that statement was, in the final analysis, careless of the true facts (at [158]). Mr Lever’s decision was overruled by the English Court of Appeal, but it was later reinstated by the House of Lords in 
Spring (HL)
.
70     When the matter eventually went before the House of Lords, the focus of the court was not on the standard of care that should be applied, but on whether finding a duty of care under the law of negligence would undermine, and be incompatible with, the policy underlying the defence of qualified privilege in the law of defamation. Lord Goff did, however, make some observations in relation to what the applicable standard of care might be. He placed great emphasis on the importance of an employer ensuring that the facts stated or relied on as the basis for an opinion expressed in a reference were accurate, as is clear from the following observations which he made at 320:
… [T]he central requirement [of the duty of care] is that reasonable care and skill should be exercised by the employer in ensuring the accuracy of any facts which either (1) are communicated to the recipient of the reference from which he may form an adverse opinion of the employee, or (2) are the basis of an adverse opinion expressed by the employer himself about the employee.
71     It can be gleaned from these earlier English cases that the courts held a reasonable employer to the standard of: (a) stating 
facts
 which were true and accurate; and (b) stating adverse 
opinions
 about an employee only to the extent that these could be supported by facts which were true and accurate. The courts also made it clear that employers must not provide references which were affected by, or laden with, prejudice, and that taking liberties with the facts would breach the duty of care.
72     Subsequent cases have gone further to hold that a reasonable employer should ensure that a reference is not only factually accurate, but also 
not unfair
 when taken as a whole: see the decisions of the English Court of Appeal in 
Bartholomew v London Borough of Hackney
 [1999] IRLR 246 (“
Bartholomew
”) and 
Cox v Sun Alliance Life Ltd
 [2001] IRLR 448 (“
Cox
”); the decision of the English High Court in 
Kidd v AXA Equity & Law Life Assurance Society plc and another
 [2000] IRLR 301 (“
Kidd
”); and the decision of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in 
TSB Bank plc v Harris
 [2000] IRLR 157 (“
TSB Bank
”).
The decision in 
Bartholomew
73     In 
Bartholomew
, the plaintiff, Mr Dennis Bartholomew (“Mr Bartholomew”), was previously employed by the defendant, the London Borough Council of Hackney (“the London Council”), as the head of its race equality unit. He was suspended pending investigations into alleged financial irregularities, for which disciplinary proceedings were later commenced. While the disciplinary proceedings were going on, Mr Bartholomew filed a complaint with an employment tribunal alleging racial discrimination on the part of the London Council. Before his complaint was disposed of, the parties reached a settlement under which the London Council agreed to allow Mr Bartholomew to opt for voluntary severance and to pay him nine weeks’ salary in lieu of notice; on his part, Mr Bartholomew agreed to withdraw his complaint. It was recorded in the settlement that the disciplinary action against Mr Bartholomew would “automatically come to an end” upon the termination of his employment.
74     Mr Bartholomew was later offered a job as a resident social worker by Richmond-upon-Thames Social Services (“Richmond”), which asked the London Council for a reference. The London Council responded as follows (at [5]):
…
Mr Bartholomew commenced employment with this authority in 1984 as a project officer. In January 1992 he was appointed as head of the race equality unit.
In February 1994, Mr Bartholomew took voluntary severance from the authority’s service following the deletion of his post.
At the time of his departure Mr Bartholomew was suspended from work due to a charge of gross misconduct, and disciplinary action had commenced. This disciplinary action lapsed automatically on his departure from the authority.
As a consequence of this reference, Richmond withdrew its offer of employment to Mr Bartholomew. Mr Bartholomew sued the London Council, arguing that while the reference was factually true, taken as a whole, it was unfair and the London Council had breached its duty of care to him.
75     The English Court of Appeal held that a reference must be true, accurate and fair, and must not give an unfair or misleading overall impression even if its discrete components were factually correct (at [22]). Its holding at [17]–[18] bears noting:
17    … [A] number of discrete statements may be factually accurate, but nevertheless may in the round give an unfair or potentially unfair impression to the reader. …
18    Mr Bartholomew’s claim against [the London Council] was of course a claim in negligence, not libel. Nevertheless the libel cases seem to me to serve as a salutary reminder that 
the fairness or unfairness, the accuracy or inaccuracy, and, indeed, [the] truth or falsity of a statement have to be taken in the round and in context and cannot be in every case dissected into a number of discrete parts
.
[emphasis added]
The court did not accept Mr Bartholomew’s submission that a reference must in every case be full and comprehensive (at [22]). On the facts of the case, it found that the reference was not unfair or inaccurate, and that the London Council had not breached its duty of care to Mr Bartholomew.
The decision in 
Kidd
76     The English High Court in 
Kidd
 followed 
Bartholomew
 in holding that the provider of a reference did not have a duty to give a full and comprehensive reference or to include in the reference 
all
 material facts, even though it had a duty not to give false or misleading information.
77     The plaintiff, Mr Richard Kidd (“Mr Kidd”), was a former representative of the defendant, AXA Equity & Law Life Assurance Society plc (“AXA Equity”). He wished to join another financial institution, Allied Dunbar, which sought a reference from AXA Equity in accordance with the LAUTRO Rules. As part of the reference, AXA Equity completed an industry questionnaire supplied by Allied Dunbar, but left some questions unanswered. AXA Equity stated as follows in the covering letter accompanying the completed questionnaire (at [8]):
…
As you are aware, Richard Kidd’s business … is currently the subject of an investigation, which is unlikely to be concluded for some time. We have not completed certain sections of your form which I intended to cover in the remainder of this letter.
Our current concerns regarding Mr Kidd’s activities arise as a result of certain complaints we have received from clients. These clients believe that they did not receive good advice from Mr Kidd. We have interviewed four clients, the results of which are not conclusive but which have led us to determine that we must carry out a customer care exercise and interview a number of other clients who have to date not complained. Since taking that decision we have received a request from [LAUTRO] following a visit they made to [check on Mr Kidd’s business] as part of [a] Periodic Inspection Visit. [LAUTRO]’s request requires us to carry out a review of all the business Mr Kidd has conducted while appointed to [AXA Equity] in order to assess whether the clients’ needs have been adequately served. Clearly there is a good deal of work to be done here.
…
78     Almost two months later, AXA Equity followed up with a supplementary letter enclosing, among other things, a handwritten letter of complaint by one of Mr Kidd’s former clients, which Allied Dunbar had asked for in a previous telephone conversation. As a result of the reference and the letters sent by AXA Equity, Allied Dunbar declined to hire Mr Kidd. Mr Kidd subsequently sued AXA Equity for negligence, but his claim was dismissed by the English High Court.
79     The judge, Burton J, observed that a former employer could possibly be subject to the following duties (at [14]):
(a)     a “stage one” duty to take reasonable care not to provide 
false
 information;
(b)     a “stage two” duty to take reasonable care not to provide 
misleading
 information; and
(c)     a “stage three” duty to take reasonable care to give a full and comprehensive reference.
After a detailed analysis, Burton J held that a former employer owed its employee a “stage one” duty and a “stage two” duty in the preparation of a reference, but not a “stage three” duty, which would require it to exercise reasonable care to give a reference that was full and comprehensive or one that included all material facts. He observed that it would be extremely difficult to formulate and define such a “stage three” duty, and more importantly, it might be overly burdensome and it might also not be in the public interest or the interest of the employee himself to impose such an obligation on employers (at [17]).
80     Burton J held that employers had a duty towards employees to take reasonable care not to give false information, or information that was misleading either because the information provided had gone through an unfair process of selection or because facts and opinions had been included in such a manner as to give rise to a false or mistaken inference in the mind of a reasonable recipient (at [15]). It is evident from the approach taken by Burton J that there are two distinct aspects of the inquiry in determining whether an employer has breached its duty of care to its employee in providing a reference:
(a)     the 
nature
 of the information provided, and whether this was tainted by reason of the way in which it was selected or presented; and
(b)     the likely 
effect
 of the reference on a reasonable recipient, and specifically, whether such a recipient would be left with a false or mistaken impression.
81     Burton J held that there was no breach of the applicable duty of care on the facts. Upon looking at the reference provided by AXA Equity in totality, Burton J found that AXA Equity had communicated that there were several unresolved complaints relating to Mr Kidd’s selling practices as well as an outstanding customer care exercise and review of his business. There was no hostile provisional view expressed, and thus, the reference was not misleading or negligently provided, even though it would inevitably be regarded as a “bad reference” (at [34]). Burton J also held that the supplementary letter which had been sent by AXA Equity to Allied Dunbar was not misleading as all that could be said about that letter was that it inadequately described the nature of the complaints against Mr Kidd (at [40]).
The decision in 
Cox
82      
Cox
 was a case where the employer was found to have failed to take reasonable care both to ensure that the facts stated in the reference which it provided were true and to ensure that the reference as a whole was fair.
83     The case concerned a reference given by the defendant, Sun Alliance Life Ltd (“Sun Alliance”), to Hambro Guardian Consultancy Ltd (“Hambro Guardian”), the new employer of the plaintiff, Mr Cox. Mr Cox had been employed by Sun Alliance for some 17 years. He was unable to get along with his colleagues at a new office, where he had been promoted as the branch manager. As a result of a serious rift that developed between Mr Cox and the other staff of that branch, Mr Cox was suspended on full pay while he was on a period of absence due to illness. There was no suggestion that the suspension was due to any financial impropriety or dishonesty on his part.
84     While negotiations for a settlement were going on, Sun Alliance received information that Mr Cox had received improper payments. Mr Cox was informed of the allegations, but Sun Alliance neither carried out any full investigation nor discussed the matter in detail with him. Sun Alliance did carry out a special audit of Mr Cox’s files, but this did not reveal any evidence of fraudulent activity. At no point did Sun Alliance accuse Mr Cox of dishonesty.
85     Eventually, the parties reached a settlement on the terms that Mr Cox would receive a lump sum of £15,000 and three months’ salary in lieu of notice in return for his amicable departure from Sun Alliance. Sun Alliance additionally agreed to provide Mr Cox with a reference, which would be worded in a manner that was agreed between the parties, should Mr Cox ever require one.
86     In the meantime, Mr Cox successfully obtained fresh employment with Hambro Guardian, which shortly after requested a reference from Sun Alliance. The reference provided by Sun Alliance stated that Mr Cox, while loyal and capable of working without supervision, was not suited to the position of a branch manager as there were concerns as to his honesty and his ability to get along with others. Although Sun Alliance did mention that Mr Cox was a successful salesman who had regularly been among the company’s “top ten salesmen”, it also stated that it would not hire Mr Cox in the same capacity (presumably as a branch manager) again. In addition to this reference, Mr Jones, Sun Alliance’s personnel services manager, also spoke to two representatives from Hambro Guardian, including a Mr Brian Cosgrave (“Mr Cosgrave”), over the telephone, during which he provided a reference to the effect that Mr Cox had been suspended pending investigation into allegations of dishonesty, and that Mr Cox would have been dismissed but had been allowed to resign instead. As a result, Hambro Guardian terminated Mr Cox’s employment.
87     Mr Cox sued Sun Alliance for damages on the basis that it had acted negligently or in breach of the settlement agreement when providing Hambro Guardian with the reference. At first instance, it was held that there was no breach of the settlement agreement, but that Sun Alliance had been negligent. On appeal, the English Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision and found that Sun Alliance had breached its duty of care to Mr Cox because Mr Jones had not taken reasonable care to be either accurate or fair. The court held as follows at [82]:
(a)     Unlike the London Council in the case of 
Bartholomew
, Mr Jones did not confine himself to a small number of factually indisputable statements. He inaccurately suggested that: (i) Mr Cox had been suspended for serious matters involving dishonesty, among other things; (ii) charges had been properly brought against Mr Cox and thoroughly investigated; and (iii) it was only after thorough investigations, which had satisfied Sun Alliance that it was entitled to dismiss Mr Cox, that it was prepared to allow him to resign under a negotiated settlement because of the difficulty of proof. Almost all of the assertions made by Mr Jones were inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree.
(b)     In totality, the reference was wholly unfair. The reference suggested, at the very least, that Sun Alliance had a reasonable basis, after a reasonable investigation, for dismissing Mr Cox on the ground of dishonesty amounting to corruption, when in truth, the charges of dishonesty that had been suggested to Hambro Guardian had never been put to Mr Cox and had never been the subject of any proper investigation or formal disciplinary proceedings, save for a special audit, which was inconclusive and later shelved pending the settlement.
88     In coming to its decision, the English Court of Appeal also placed weight on Mr Jones’ lack of objectivity in making the statements about Mr Cox’s suspension from work and his subsequent departure from Sun Alliance, as well as the evidence of Mr Cosgrave (the representative from Hambro Guardian) that Mr Jones had been almost overly enthusiastic and gleeful when he provided the information about Mr Cox over the telephone (at [83]).
89     It is evident that the English Court of Appeal took into account the gravity of the effect which the reference had on the employee in assessing the standard of care required of the employer. In our judgment, this is sensible. Where a reference contains adverse suggestions touching on matters such as the honesty or integrity of the employee concerned, the employer will be expected to take particular care to consider how the suggestions would likely be understood by a reasonable recipient of the reference, and to ensure that the suggestions are: (a) fairly and reasonably made; and (b) founded on a sound factual basis.
The decision in 
TSB Bank
90     Finally, we turn to 
TSB Bank
. That case did not involve a claim in negligence, but instead concerned an allegation of a breach of an implied term of contract so as to give rise to constructive dismissal. The issue was whether the employer had breached the implied term of trust and confidence in an employment contract by revealing complaints against the employee, of which she was unaware, in a reference that it gave to her prospective employer, thereby causing her to lose her chance of obtaining new employment. Although the employee’s claim against the employer was not based on negligence, the observations made by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in that case are nonetheless relevant and useful for our purposes.
91     The plaintiff, Ms Harris, was a savings and investment adviser at TSB Bank plc (“TSB”). In the course of Ms Harris’s employment with TSB, TSB received complaints from customers about her giving misleading or inadequate information to them. Except for two of the complaints, Ms Harris was not informed of these complaints and so was never given an opportunity to furnish an explanation in relation to them. It was also undisputed that she had previously been given a final warning for forgery when she changed an entry on a form and initialled it on behalf of her customer so as to save time.
92     In 1996, Ms Harris looked for another job following the arrival of a new manager whom she considered was hostile towards her. She applied to Prudential Assurance Company (“PAC”) for a position. During her interview, she explained the forgery incident to PAC, and this was accepted (at [35]). In keeping with the LAUTRO Rules, PAC approached TSB for a reference. The reference provided by TSB contained no assessment of Ms Harris’s character and was confined to factual statements. It stated that 17 complaints had been made against Ms Harris, out of which four had been upheld and eight were outstanding. As a result of this reference, PAC declined to hire Ms Harris, who was shocked to discover that there had been so many undisclosed complaints against her. She resigned from TSB and presented a complaint before an employment tribunal for unfair and constructive dismissal.
93     The employment tribunal at first instance found that TSB had breached an implied term of trust and confidence in referring to the complaints, which Ms Harris had not previously been informed of and against which she had not had an opportunity to defend herself. This presented a misleading picture of Ms Harris. It also found that this breach had caused her to leave her employment. TSB’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal, whose observations at [46] are pertinent:
… [T]he law does not oblige an employer to help an employee obtain other work and … a reference does not have to be complete but only reasonable and fair. … [I]n assessing whether [TSB] were in breach of contract, the tribunal were entitled to, and we find, did, consider not only the quality of the act of sticking to the regulations in isolation, but also in relation to its effect on the employee. They found that [TSB’s] approach, because of its misleading effect, was damaging. In a similar way the phrase ‘being economical with the truth’ has become part of our language. 
Referring to unrevealed complaints may be nothing more than the truth, and completely accurate, but simply to be accurate in what is said may not lead to a ‘reasonable and fair’ reference.
 The tribunal found that to give half the story is to take a positive step, the result of which risks creating a misleading impression that is liable to damage an employee permanently. … [emphasis added]
The Employment Appeal Tribunal noted that steps such as informing the employee of complaints at the stage when the complaints were made or when the reference was being prepared, or the provision of a fuller reference could be taken in order to ensure that the employee was not unfairly prejudiced (at [71]).
94     The Employment Appeal Tribunal stated as a caveat that the situation might be different where the subject of the reference was a 
former
 employee as opposed to a current employee, and left open the question as to whether a similar obligation would be present in the former situation as it was not engaged on the facts (at [68]). The hesitancy of the Employment Appeal Tribunal to hold that the obligation also applied to a 
former
 employee may be due to the fact that 
TSB Bank
 concerned the implied term of trust and confidence in a contract of employment. In 
Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson & Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd
 
[2014] 4 SLR 357
 at [24], we observed that this implied term entailed that a party “shall not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between employer and employee”. An argument might thus be made that such an obligation does not extend to a 
former
 employee as the relationship of mutual trust and confidence no longer subsists after the termination of the employment relationship. We leave this question open for it to be decided in a case with a factual matrix that engages it. The present case involves not the implied term of trust and confidence in an employment contract, but a duty of care in negligence to avoid giving an unfair or misleading impression of an employee in an employment reference. As we have stated at [59] above, there is no distinction between the duty of care expected of a former and a current employer in this regard (see also [253]–[254] of the Judgment).
95     Subject to these observations, we largely agree with the views expressed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in 
TSB Bank
, although we think it would perhaps be more precise to replace the word “accurate” in the passage quoted at [93] above (from [46] of 
TSB Bank
) with the word “true”. As we explain at [98] below, the two words bear slightly different meanings. The accuracy of a statement entails not only that what is said is 
true
, but also that what is 
not
 said would not result in the recipient having a wrong impression.
96     Two other observations of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in 
TSB Bank
 bear highlighting:
(a)     First, the appeal tribunal agreed with the tribunal below that an employer could not rely on the fact that it was only doing what was required of it under the regulations governing the financial services industry to contend that the reference which it had given was fair and reasonable, not least because its obligations to its regulator were not the measure of its obligations to its employee (at [44]).
(b)     Second, the appeal tribunal also held that an employer could not rely on the standard practice of the industry in the way in which complaints were handled and references were given to contend that it was not in breach of its implied obligation to its employee. This was because the fact that a practice was widespread did not change the fact that to disclose in a reference complaints which had not previously been made known to the employee and which could potentially destroy the employee’s career was a breach of the implied term of trust and confidence (at [58]).
We agree with both of these observations, which, in our view, apply equally in the context of negligence.
The applicable standard of care in Singapore
97     In broad terms, we find ourselves in agreement with the approach that has been developed in the English cases. In particular, we consider that an employer who writes a reference for an employee is obliged to exercise due care to ensure that the facts contained in the reference are true, and that any opinions expressed in the reference are based on, and supported by, facts which are true.
98     Beyond exercising due care to ensure that the facts stated in a reference are true, the employer is also required to exercise due care to ensure that the facts are 
accurate
. This follows from the requirement that the reference, as a whole, must not be unfair or misleading, but it is worth drawing out this point for emphasis. As alluded to at [95] above, accuracy depends not only on what is said, but also on what is 
not
 said (
ie
, what has been withheld). An assertion consisting of facts that are true may not be accurate if it conveys a misleading impression because it fails to present the full picture. This was the case in 
TSB Bank
. Therefore, although there is no requirement that a reasonable employer must disclose everything which it knows about the employee who is the subject of the reference (see [75] and [79] above as well as [100] below), it is expected to disclose whatever is relevant and relates to information that has already been disclosed, where withholding such information would render the disclosed information incomplete, inaccurate or unfair. This may assume particular significance where a recipient of a reference asks for further information or clarification pertaining to what has been disclosed. The employer would continue to owe the employee the same duty of care when responding to such requests.
99     We do not go so far as to say that an employer is required to 
guarantee
 the accuracy or truth of a reference. What is required is the exercise of 
reasonable care
 in the preparation of the reference so as to meet the foregoing requirements of truth, accuracy and fairness (see Lord Lowry’s observations in 
Spring (HL)
 at 327).
100    In this regard, as we have indicated earlier (at [98] above), a reference need not be full and comprehensive. A reference will not be faulted on the ground that it did not contain each and every material fact about the employee concerned as long as the omission to include any fact does not thereby render the reference either unfair or inaccurate. Save to this extent, to require an employer to include all information (both positive and negative) in a reference would be unrealistic and unduly onerous. In any event, it is reasonable to expect the employee himself, and not his employer, to present his own best case for employment. Further, some references may specifically require the inclusion of adverse information.
101    An adverse reference will not automatically be regarded as being unfair or misleading. Some references, such as the Reference Check Form in the present case, are meant to elicit primarily adverse information. In such cases, an employer clearly cannot be faulted for not including 
positive
 attributes about the employee in the reference, save and except where such information relates to other disclosed information and its non-disclosure renders the disclosed information incomplete, inaccurate or unfair.
102    Drawing these principles together, we formulate and summarise the applicable standard of care expected of a reasonable employer (including a former employer) when writing a reference for its employee (including a former employee) as follows:
(a)     The employer must exercise reasonable care to ensure that: (i) the facts stated in the reference are true; and (ii) any opinions expressed there are based on, and supported by, facts which are true (see [64], [69]–[71], [75], [79]–[80], [87] and [97]–[98] above).
(b)     The employer must also exercise reasonable care to ensure that the reference does not give an unfair or misleading overall impression of the employee, even if the discrete pieces of information which it contains are factually correct. In other words, due care must be taken to ensure that the reference is not only 
true
, but also 
accurate
 in the sense of not being misleading or unfair. The information that is provided may be considered misleading or unfair where: (i) the information provided has gone through an unfair process of selection; or (ii) the manner in which the facts and opinions have been included gives rise to a false or mistaken impression in the mind of a reasonable recipient of the reference (see [75], [79]–[80], [87], [93], [95] and [98] above).
(c)     The employer is required to exercise reasonable care to disclose any information that relates to information which has already been provided, where to withhold such further information would render the information that has been disclosed incomplete, inaccurate or unfair. This continues to be the case when the recipient of the reference seeks further information or clarification pertaining to what has been disclosed (see [98] above).
(d)     Subject to the foregoing qualifications, the employer is 
not
 required to give a full and comprehensive reference or to include 
all
 material facts about the employee in the reference (see [75], [79], [98] and [100] above).
(e)     In general, the employer should not include in the reference, whether explicitly or implicitly, complaints or other allegations against the employee that the latter had no knowledge of and had not been given an opportunity to explain or defend himself against. In particular, complaints that were not conveyed to the employee because they were found to be baseless should not be disclosed unless the employer is, for some reason, obliged to do so. In such a case, the employer should make it explicit that: (i) the complaint was dismissed as baseless; and (ii) the employee was not informed of it at that time. The employer should also inform the employee concurrently (see [93] above).
(f)     In assessing what constitutes reasonable care, regard will be had to the gravity of any adverse suggestion or inference contained in the reference (see [89] above). The greater the gravity of any adverse suggestion or inference, the more closely will the employer’s conduct be scrutinised to ascertain whether it has taken reasonable care to ensure that the suggestion or inference in question: (i) is based on facts which are true and accurate; and (ii) is, in view of those facts, fair and reasonable.
103    In our judgment, it is just to impose such a standard of care upon an employer because of the combination of three factors:
(a)     the potential harm that may be inflicted on an employee through a negligently prepared reference;
(b)     the often inevitable inclination that an employer may have to damage the prospects of an employee who might be about to join a competitor or who has already done so; and
(c)     the inability of an employee to safeguard his own position adequately.
104    These three factors can be illustrated using the context and the facts of the present case. We start with the first factor – the ability to cause harm. It is uncontroversial that negligently prepared references can have serious potential consequences. Such a reference may paint the employee concerned in an unfair and inaccurate light, which might in turn cost him the opportunity to obtain fresh employment. In the context of the financial advisory and insurance industry, references given by employers such as the Respondent would be relied on by an employee’s prospective new employers in deciding whether to hire the employee as well as by the industry regulator, MAS, in deciding whether to grant him a RNF licence.
105    Second, in cases where an employee is leaving, or has left, his employer to seek employment with a competitor, the employer may have the inclination, if not the motive, to act in its self-interest and write a reference that would adversely affect the employee’s chances of getting the job. Ironically, the better the employee, the greater the employer’s incentive to thwart his prospects of working for a rival. Further, it is also not inconceivable that an employer might be motivated to paint an employee in a negative light if the circumstances that led to his departure were not amicable. We are not suggesting that financial institutions are bound to be motivated by the wrong considerations when they write references, but as long as the possibility exists, it is appropriate to impose a standard of care that would minimise the prospects of this happening.
106    Third, the information that an employer provides in a reference is commonly not disclosed to the employee. Thus, even if the employee has an opportunity of self-disclosure, he might not know the contents of the reference and might therefore not be able to defend himself or correct any mistake or misrepresentation in the reference. This in fact was what transpired in the present case. The Respondent sent its reference check responses to Prudential and Tokio Marine without the Appellant having a chance to see their contents until he filed his suit against the Respondent and obtained these documents through discovery. As a result, even though the RNF includes a segment for self-disclosure, and even though Prudential and Tokio Marine had given the Appellant the opportunity to respond to some of their queries, the Appellant was unable to do so with sufficient appreciation of what had been said about him. It is appropriate, in such circumstances, to expect the person providing the reference to take reasonable care to do so in terms that are accurate and fair.
107    Against the backdrop of these principles, we turn to consider the facts of this case. We first address two preliminary issues.
Preliminary issues
108    First, we note that the Appellant has brought two claims based on negligence in these proceedings – one in respect of the reference check response which was provided to Prudential and one in respect of that provided to Tokio Marine. As acknowledged by counsel for the Appellant, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”), at the hearing before us, the Appellant would not be able to obtain damages for both claims even if he succeeds on both as he could only have been employed by 
either
 Prudential 
or
 Tokio Marine, but not by both firms. Thus, if we find in the Appellant’s favour in respect of his claim concerning his application to join Prudential, there would be no need for us to consider his claim concerning his application to join Tokio Marine. Conversely, if we rule against the Appellant on his claim relating to his application to join Prudential, then given the overlapping facts of his two claims in negligence, including the fact that the references provided in both instances were materially similar, it is likely that his claim in respect of his application to join Tokio Marine will fail as well. For these reasons, we will not address the claim pertaining to the Appellant’s application to join Tokio Marine in the analysis that follows.
109    Second, the Respondent objects that the Appellant has “strayed very far” from his pleaded case. Specifically, counsel for the Respondent, Mr Pillai K Muralidharan (“Mr Pillai”), argues that the Appellant cannot be allowed to now rely on the subsequent correspondence that took place between the Respondent, Prudential and MAS when all that he had pleaded for the purposes of his negligence claim in respect of his application to join Prudential was that the statements on persistency ratios and compliance issues in the Prudential Reference Check Form were “false” and, furthermore, were “not full, frank and truthful”. In this regard, Mr Pillai points us to paras 41 and 42 of the Appellant’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) dated 25 April 2013 (“the Amended Statement of Claim”).
110    With respect, we do not accept Mr Pillai’s submission and are satisfied that the Appellant has sufficiently pleaded his case. While it is true that the Appellant did not make any specific reference to the Respondent’s subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS in that part of his pleadings which detailed how the Respondent breached its duty of care, he did refer to the relevant correspondence in the part which detailed the scope of the Respondent’s duty of care. In respect of the latter, para 37 of the Amended Statement of Claim states that “the [Respondent] was under a duty to the [Appellant] to take reasonable care in the preparation of … the [Respondent’s] Reply when responding to Prudential’s Reference Check Request 
and the [Respondent’s] Subsequent Correspondence with Prudential
; … [and] 
the [Respondent’s] Correspondence with the MAS in 2011 and the [Respondent’s] Subsequent Statements to the MAS
” [emphasis added]. The italicised words encompass all the relevant correspondence which the Appellant seeks to rely on in support of his argument that the Respondent was negligent in providing the information which it furnished to Prudential and MAS. This, in our view, suffices to give adequate notice to the Respondent that the negligence claim extends to its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS. We also note that all the correspondence in fact originated from the Respondent and featured at the trial below. In the circumstances, we cannot see that the Respondent will suffer any prejudice or unfairness if the Appellant is allowed to go beyond the statements on persistency ratios and compliance issues in the Prudential Reference Check Form and rely on the Respondent’s subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS in support of his contention that the Respondent breached the duty of care which it owed him.
Did the Respondent breach its duty of care to the Appellant?
111    We turn now to consider whether the Respondent breached its duty of care to the Appellant in its provision of the information set out in the Prudential Reference Check Form and in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS. The information furnished to Prudential and MAS can be classified for the purposes of analysis into three broad categories:
(a)     information in respect of the persistency ratios of the Ramesh Organisation;
(b)     information in respect of the compliance issues involving the Appellant and some of the advisers in the Ramesh Organisation; and
(c)     information on, and allusions to, possible ethical violations by the Appellant and the Ramesh Organisation advisers in general.
112    In our judgment, the Respondent did not meet the requisite standard of care in providing the information in each of the categories listed above. This becomes even more apparent when the information provided is taken as a whole.
Information on persistency ratios 
The provision of the persistency ratio for single premium policies was not unfair or misleading 
113    We begin with the Respondent’s provision of a 19-month persistency ratio in respect of 
single
 premium policies in the Prudential Reference Check Form (see [22] above). Unlike the position in relation to 
regular
 premium policies, where the dispute centres on the method that was used to calculate the persistency ratio, the Appellant does not take issue with the use of the 19-month measure in respect of 
single
 premium policies. The 19-month persistency ratio calculates the rate at which policyholders choose to retain their funds in respect of their single premium policies over the preceding 18-month period. What the Appellant takes issue with is the Respondent’s decision to include the persistency ratio for single premium policies 
at all
 in the Prudential Reference Check Form. He argues that the Respondent should not have included this information as it knew that since the beginning of 2010, the Ramesh Organisation had predominantly focused on regular premium products instead (see [16] above); alternatively, the Respondent should have included an explanation as to why the persistency ratio for single premium policies was so low in the circumstances.
114    We do not accept this argument. The Appellant has not shown why it was unfair or misleading for the Respondent to include the persistency ratio for single premium policies in the Prudential Reference Check Form. The Ramesh Organisation might have chosen to adopt a particular sales approach and focus only on regular premium policies, but this did not, without more, impose an obligation on the Respondent to withhold disclosure of the persistency ratio for single premium policies. In this regard, we note that Mr Tay Teck Leong (“Mr Tay”) from Prudential did give evidence at the trial which suggested that Prudential usually expects to receive a 
general
 persistency ratio which does not distinguish between single and regular premium policies in the references that it is provided with. But, this by itself does not provide a sufficient basis for us to conclude that it was improper or unfair for the Respondent to include the information on the persistency ratio for single premium policies.
The use of the 13-month measure in respect of regular premium policies was misleading and unfair 
115    However, the same cannot be said of the use of the 13-month measure, as opposed to the 19-month measure, for the persistency ratio of 
regular
 premium policies in the Prudential Reference Check Form. In our judgment, the use of the 13-month measure was misleading and unfair to the Appellant, even though the resultant persistency ratio of 39.6% might have been factually true and mathematically correct.
116    It is necessary to first explain the differences between the 13-month and the 19-month measures of persistency ratios. As we have noted at [9] above, persistency ratios track the number of insurance policies sold by advisers that are still in force over a period of time. There are various methods by which persistency ratios can be measured, and it appears that there is no standard industry practice. In the context of regular premium policies, the 13-month ratio calculates the percentage of customers who renew their policies and pay the renewal premiums when these fall due at the end of a 12-month period, while the 19-month ratio measures the number of policies that are still in force over an 18-month period. The reported persistency ratio can differ greatly depending on which measure is employed, as can be seen from the fact that the Ramesh Organisation’s 13-month persistency ratio for regular premium policies was a disappointing 39.6%, while its 19-month persistency ratio for the same type of policies was 89.5%. This is principally because:
(a)     Until January 2012, the 19-month measure used by the Respondent incorporated a “premium cap”. We have stated above at [9] that in calculating persistency ratios, regard may be had not only to the number of policies that have lapsed over a given period, but also to (among other factors) the amount of premiums lost on account of the policies that have lapsed. The “premium cap” in the 19-month measure used by the Respondent meant that when an adviser’s 19-month persistency ratio was calculated, those of his lapsed policies which had premiums higher than a certain amount specified by the Respondent would be treated as having premiums of only that specified amount. Hence, the total amount of premiums lost due to his lapsed policies would be treated as being lower than the actual figure. The 13-month measure did not incorporate such a “premium cap”. In effect, this meant that if an adviser had many lapsed policies with large premiums, his 13-month persistency ratio would be significantly poorer than his 19-month persistency ratio due to the absence of a “premium cap” in respect of the former.
(b)     Second, prior to April 2011, policies that were on “premium holidays” (where the policyholder invokes a provision in the policy which permits him to cease making premium payments for a particular period and instead draw on the accumulated cash value of the policy to keep the premiums current during that period) were regarded as policies that had lapsed for the purposes of the 13-month measure, but not the 19-month measure. It would follow that an adviser who had many policies on “premium holidays” under him would have a far lower 13-month persistency ratio compared to his 19-month persistency ratio.
117    We accept that a financial institution may legitimately employ various possible methods to calculate persistency ratios because there is no standard industry practice. There is nothing wrong, in and of itself, if a financial institution chooses to use the 13-month measure when providing a reference. What we find objectionable in the present case is that the choice of the 13-month measure: (a) was the result of an unfair process of selection because it had never been a measure used by the Respondent to assess the Appellant during his time there; and (b) had the effect of giving rise to a false or mistaken inference in the mind of a reasonable recipient of the reference as the Ramesh Organisation’s persistency ratio based on the 13-month measure was much lower than that based on the 19-month measure, which was the measure that the Respondent had used to evaluate the Appellant and the advisers under him while he was working there. In other words, both limbs which would usually lead to a finding that the information provided is misleading (see [102(b)] above) are made out in this case. For the avoidance of doubt, we emphasise that the present situation must be differentiated from one where a financial institution which has always used or has for a time been using – with notice to its agents or employees – a given measure uses 
that
 measure in its reference check responses.
118    We accept the Appellant’s submission that the 13-month measure had been unfairly selected by the Respondent in place of the 19-month measure in respect of regular premium policies. It is evident that at the material time, the Respondent assessed its advisers, including the Appellant and the advisers in the Ramesh Organisation, using the 19-month measure. Although there was some evidence to suggest that the Respondent was thinking of moving towards the use of the 13-month measure and might genuinely have thought that this would provide a more accurate reflection of the quality of an adviser’s sales, this essentially took place 
after
 the Appellant left the company. Throughout the period that the Appellant was with the Respondent, the method of calculation adopted for assessing his performance and for reference check responses was the 19-month measure. In fact, it was undisputed that the Prudential Reference Check Form was the first occasion on which the Respondent had used the 13-month measure in a reference check response. As a result of the Respondent’s decision to use a different measure in that Reference Check Form, the Appellant’s impression of his own performance was at odds with what was reflected in that form.
119    The Judge placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the Respondent had introduced the idea of using the 13-month measure of persistency to its advisers, including the Appellant, at the “Agency Persistency Workshop for FSDs” held on 8 March 2011 (approximately six weeks before the Appellant’s resignation), and concluded on this basis that the Respondent had not invented the 13-month measure solely for the purpose of responding to Prudential’s reference check request on the Appellant (see [282] of the Judgment; see also [51] above). With respect, we do not think much turns on this. Even if we accept that the Respondent had introduced the 13-month measure to its advisers, including the Appellant, at that workshop, there was no evidence to suggest that the Respondent had announced that that measure would thenceforth be used. In fact, one of the presentation slides suggests the 
reverse
, 
ie
, that the Respondent would continue using the 19-month measure, but would refine the method by which the 19-month persistency ratio was calculated.
120    Further, there was nothing to show that the Appellant had ever been given any information on his 13-month persistency ratio before he left the Respondent. Although Mr Williams asserted in cross-examination that this information had been available to the Appellant because it could be found on the Respondent’s intranet system and database called “AXA Reach”, this unsubstantiated assertion, which emerged only at a very late stage of the trial, was not persuasive. The Respondent was unable to provide 
any
 documentary evidence to support its assertion that the Appellant had ever been informed that he was, or would be, assessed based on the 13-month measure, or even that his 13-month persistency ratio was available to him on the Respondent’s intranet. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Appellant had no knowledge of the use of the 13-month assessment methodology. It follows, in our judgment, that the 13-month measure should not have been used in the Prudential Reference Check Form in respect of regular premium policies handled by the Ramesh Organisation. As we have observed at [102(e)] above, an employer should refrain from including in a reference any allegations against an employee which the latter had no knowledge of and therefore had no opportunity to explain or defend himself against. This applies equally to 
implicit
 allegations which may be inferred from the information contained in the reference.
121    The Respondent’s decision to use the 13-month measure in the Prudential Reference Check Form in respect of regular premium policies handled by the Ramesh Organisation was also objectionable because it would have caused a reasonable recipient of the form to have a mistaken impression that the Appellant was not competent. This does not square with the evidence, which instead suggests that he was one of the Respondent’s best financial services directors, had been awarded incentives (such as a free trip to Bangkok and a free Apple iPad) and was one of the best compensated advisers as at February 2011, just two months before his departure from the Respondent. The impression of the Appellant that was created by the use of the 13-month measure in the Prudential Reference Check Form was simply incongruous with the profile of a senior financial services director who had won numerous accolades and was clearly valued by the Respondent, so much so that it had persuaded the Appellant not to resign when he wanted to do so in January 2011 (see [17] above).
Relevant information was withheld in subsequent correspondence
122    The Respondent likewise failed to meet the requisite standard of care in withholding relevant information and failing to respond adequately in its subsequent communications with Prudential. As stated at [102(c)] above, an employer’s duty of care to its employee extends to providing further information or clarification to the employee’s prospective employer when the latter requests this, where the withholding of such information would render the disclosed information incomplete, inaccurate or unfair.
123    The Respondent failed to adequately respond to Prudential’s 
repeated
 attempts over the course of almost a month to seek further information on the method by which the Respondent had calculated the persistency ratios that it provided (see [26]–[28] above). Indeed, the Respondent 
never
 provided this information to Prudential. This was despite Prudential’s clear indication in its second request for further information on 18 July 2011 that it needed the information in order to understand why the persistency ratios provided in the Prudential Reference Check Form differed so greatly from those provided by the Appellant (see [28] above). The Respondent was therefore aware that the Appellant had attempted to respond to Prudential’s queries, and that this had resulted in disparate information being provided. For the Respondent not to respond to Prudential’s request for clarification in these circumstances was plainly and manifestly unfair. In our judgment, this rendered the information that the Respondent provided to Prudential incomplete, inaccurate and unfair to the Appellant.
Subsequent information on the Ramesh Organisation’s “very poor” 13-month persistency ratio was also unfair and misleading 
124    In fact, the Respondent not only did not provide further information or clarification to Prudential, but also made further misleading statements to the effect that the Ramesh Organisation had a “very poor” 13-month persistency ratio of only 9% in the 14 October Letter to Prudential, which was copied to MAS (see [29] above), and in its email to MAS dated 9 November 2011 (see [35] above).
125    Even if we accept that those statements were factually true, in our judgment, they were incomplete, misleading and unfair. As we pointed out at [31(b)] above, the Respondent did not explain how the 13-month persistency ratio stated in the 14 October Letter was derived, which period it covered, whether it was for single or regular premium policies and why it differed from the earlier ratios provided in the Prudential Reference Check Form. In particular, the Respondent did not explain that the persistency ratio might have dropped so drastically because of the departure of the Appellant and the bulk of the advisers under him, which resulted in many of the policies previously handled by them becoming “orphan” policies with no adviser to take over these policies properly, thus causing a corresponding increase in the number of lapsed policies. In our judgment, the withholding of these details had the effect of making the disclosed information misleading, incomplete and unfair to the Appellant.
Information on compliance issues 
126    We turn next to the information that the Respondent provided in respect of the compliance issues involving the Appellant and some of the advisers in the Ramesh Organisation.
127    In our judgment, the Respondent breached its duty of care to the Appellant in:
(a)     providing, in respect of the compliance issues, information that was incomplete and, thus, misleading and inaccurate; and
(b)     failing to disclose information that was relevant and that related to information which had already been disclosed, when further information was sought by Prudential on 7 and 21 June 2011.
We address each of these findings in turn below.
Incomplete, misleading and inaccurate information was given
128    Apart from making three bare statements in the Prudential Reference Check Form that: (a) 14 of the advisers in the Ramesh Organisation, including the Appellant, had been investigated; (b) disciplinary action had been taken against five advisers; and (c) three advisers’ cases had been referred to the police for further investigation (see [22] above), the Respondent did not provide any further details of the compliance issues which it mentioned in that Reference Check Form. This would have left a reasonable recipient of the form unclear as to: (a) the gravity of the misconduct that had been alleged against the various parties; (b) the outcome of the investigations and the disciplinary measures taken; and in particular, (c) what the investigation against the Appellant pertained to.
129    The impression conveyed by the disclosed information was that a substantial number of advisers working under the Appellant’s supervision, as well as the Appellant himself, had been investigated for compliance issues; five of the advisers had then faced disciplinary action, out of which three advisers’ cases had been serious enough to be referred to the police for further investigation. This unfairly gives rise to the inference on the part of a reasonable recipient of the information that the Appellant had been involved in some serious misconduct and had been investigated for that reason. Apart from casting doubt on the Appellant’s character, the information disclosed also impugned his managerial and leadership abilities. From a plain reading of the statements on compliance issues in the Prudential Reference Check Form, a reasonable recipient of the form would likely have formed the view that the Appellant was not a dependable or effective manager, and might even have questioned his integrity in the light of the number of advisers under him who had been investigated or disciplined.
130    Again, the impression created by the sparse information that was provided and the manner in which the information was provided does not cohere with the actual state of affairs. The so-called investigation against the Appellant in fact stemmed from a mere complaint by a client’s brother that the Appellant had “behaved rudely and aggressively” towards him at a meeting, and no further action was taken because there was no evidence to substantiate the complaint. None of the three cases referred to the police were serious enough to warrant prosecution. Moreover, contrary to the impression created by the information which the Respondent disclosed, the various incidents did not appear to be related to each other. Mr Pillai contended that it should have been clear from the annotation “N/A” in Section A of the Prudential Reference Check Form that the Appellant had never been reported to MAS for misconduct (see [21] above), and thus, the Respondent could not be said to have misled the recipient of the form. We do not agree. Notwithstanding the fact that the Respondent had indicated “N/A” in Section A, a reasonable recipient of the form would likely have entertained doubts about the integrity and character of the Appellant, given the manner in which the information on compliance issues was disclosed. A transgression may be serious even if it does not warrant a report being lodged with MAS. More importantly, we do not think it is reasonable for the Respondent to contend that the annotation “N/A” in Section A meant that the Appellant had never misconducted himself, given what it had stated in the annex to Section B. Indeed, Mr Tay from Prudential testified during cross-examination that Prudential had read the annotation “N/A” 
in conjunction
 with the annex to Section B, and had concluded that “N/A” had been written to signify that there was no other misconduct aside from what had been disclosed in the annex.
131    Although we accept that the responses set out in a Reference Check Form are meant to be brief, and that the prospective employer can seek elaboration or clarification of the information provided should that be required, we do not think this assists the Respondent. The information provided in a Reference Check Form must, by itself, be fair and accurate. The Respondent cannot seek to evade this obligation by arguing that the employer would have an opportunity to supplement the information which it has provided and correct any misleading impression arising from that information with more information in the future 
if
 such information is 
later
 requested by the prospective employer. Given that the Respondent had thought it fit to mention the Appellant’s compliance issues in the Prudential Reference Check Form, it: (a) should have made it clear in the same document that no further action had been taken against the Appellant; (b) should have provided brief details of the complaint against the Appellant; and (c) should not have presented the information in the way that it did by juxtaposing it with the information on disciplinary measures and police investigations that had been carried out against other advisers in the Ramesh Organisation and suggesting that these were all somehow connected. Further, and in any event, as we discuss at [133]–[135] below, the Respondent never responded to Prudential’s requests for further information on the investigations pertaining to the other Ramesh Organisation advisers.
132    We also note that the Appellant was not involved in either the disciplinary process or the investigations against the other Ramesh Organisation advisers, even though he was informed of the eventual findings made by the Respondent. Further, he was not held responsible for those advisers’ misconduct in any way. In these circumstances, we find it unsatisfactory that the Respondent chose to include in the Prudential Reference Check Form statements concerning the investigations and disciplinary measures against those advisers.
Relevant information was largely withheld in subsequent correspondence 
133    Just as it did in relation to the information on persistency ratios, the Respondent also failed to meet the standard of care in largely 
withholding
 relevant information on the compliance issues mentioned in the Prudential Reference Check Form in its subsequent communications with Prudential. In this regard, we disagree with the Judge’s finding at [283] of the Judgment that the Respondent did provide Prudential with the relevant information in its subsequent responses to the latter’s queries.
134    Prudential made at least two attempts to obtain further information on the compliance issues mentioned in the Prudential Reference Check Form, in particular, on the investigations concerning the Appellant and the three cases that had been referred to the police for further investigation (see [24] and [26] above). The Respondent only provided further information about the complaint that had been made against the Appellant, but not about the investigations pertaining to the other Ramesh Organisation advisers. Mr Tay from Prudential testified that Prudential was unable to obtain the necessary information from the Respondent and had to turn instead to the Appellant for information:
A:
After subsequently when 
we couldn’t get an answer [from the Respondent]
 -- I think for these cases, 
I think we have tried many rounds of requests, but the answer was not quite forthcoming
, so subsequently, when we can’t get any result, we have to get it from [the Appellant] himself on a one-sided basis.
…
 
Q:
Did you manage to get details of the agents who were allegedly investigated and allegedly disciplined and details of the three police cases from [the Appellant]?
A:
Yes, it’s all from [the Appellant].
…
 
[emphasis added]
135    The Respondent argues that it should not be faulted for not having provided further information about the investigations pertaining to the other Ramesh Organisation advisers as they were not the subject of Prudential’s reference check request. We do not agree. The Respondent’s omission is not only inexplicable but also unjustifiable, given that it had thought it fit to include mention of those advisers in the Prudential Reference Check Form in the first place. Since the Respondent had thought it necessary to disclose that information, the least it could then do was to provide brief details of what the investigations against those Ramesh Organisation advisers pertained to. In our judgment, there was nothing to stop the Respondent from giving brief details or at least the outcome of the investigations, and making it clear that they had nothing to do with the Appellant. All this could have been done without disclosing the identities of the Ramesh Organisation advisers concerned. In short, the Respondent could have indicated the nature and gravity of the alleged misconduct that led to the investigations and/or disciplinary measures against those Ramesh Organisation advisers, as well as whether or not their conduct reflected on the Appellant. However, none of this was done.
136    In our judgment, it was unfair of the Respondent to first include the information on compliance issues in the Prudential Reference Check Form in such an incomplete, vague and misleading manner, and then refuse to disclose more information when this was asked for, given that such further information would have been relevant to clarify the misimpression conveyed by the information disclosed in the form.
Information on, and allusions to, possible ethical violations
137    We turn to the last category of information provided by the Respondent – the information on, and allusions to, possible ethical violations by the Appellant and the Ramesh Organisation advisers generally. The relevant information and allusions were contained in the Respondent’s subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS, specifically, in the following two documents:
(a)     the 14 October Letter sent directly by Mr Williams to Prudential’s CEO and copied to MAS, which stated not only that the Ramesh Organisation’s 13-month persistency ratio was only 9%, but also that there was “strong reason to believe that the ex-advisers in [the] Ramesh Organisation have been involved in [the] twisting of clients’ policies”, and that the Respondent was “very concerned as to whether the clients have been provided with proper advice or [whether] any improper switching/replacement practices [have been] carried out … which are detrimental to [the] clients’ interests” (see [29] above); and
(b)     the Respondent’s email to MAS on 9 November 2011, which stated, among other things, that the Appellant’s conduct “potentially indicat[ed] gaming of compensation”, and that it appeared that he had “‘sailed very close to the wind’ and [had] ultimately crossed the line” (see [35] above).
138    It is evident that the Respondent used very strong words to describe the conduct of the Appellant and the Ramesh Organisation advisers in these two documents. As we have stated at [89] and [102(f)] above, the greater the gravity of any adverse remark contained in a reference, the more closely will the employer’s acts be scrutinised to ensure that reasonable care was taken to ascertain: (a) the truth as well as the accuracy of the facts which are said to support that remark; and (b) the fairness and reasonableness of any expressed opinion based on those facts. In the present case, the Respondent made very serious allegations of, and allusions to, potential ethical violations by the Appellant and the advisers under him. Yet, there does not appear to be any basis for, or any attempt to substantiate, those views. It was unclear even before us whether the opinions and suggestions conveyed in these documents were based on, or supported by, facts which are true and accurate.
139    It is immaterial whether the Respondent or Mr Williams personally believed that the Appellant might have been guilty of the ethical violations mentioned in the 14 October Letter and the email to MAS of 9 November 2011. On this particular issue, a parallel can be drawn with the situation in 
Spring (HC)
, where Mr Lever held that Mr Siderfin had acted in breach of his duty of care to Mr Spring in making the statement that Mr Spring was lacking in dishonesty and integrity because even if he genuinely believed that to be the case, the statement had been made without careful and accurate assessment, and was, in the final analysis, careless of the true facts (see [69] above). On the evidence before us, the same can be said of the information provided by the Respondent in these two documents, which suggested ethical failures on the part of the Appellant and the advisers under him.
140    The tone and the contents of these two documents also suggest that the Respondent, and in particular, Mr Williams, was attempting to paint the Appellant in as bad a light as possible. In particular, these two documents show the Respondent’s efforts to highlight as much negative information about the Appellant as possible, even when such information was not asked for by the recipient. This can also be seen from the internal correspondence between Mr Williams and Mr Ng when the Respondent was preparing its reply to Tokio Marine’s request for more information on the compliance issues mentioned in the Respondent’s reference check response (see [43]–[45] above). Mr Williams told Mr Ng that the Respondent “need[ed] to be much stronger”, and directed him to add more adverse details about the Appellant, which Tokio Marine had not requested, as well as a “recommend[ation] that [Tokio Marine’s CEO] phone [Mr Williams] … for more details on this case”. Although this correspondence pertains to the Appellant’s application to join Tokio Marine as opposed to Prudential, it is nonetheless relevant in helping us to understand the Respondent’s overall state of mind when it prepared its reference check responses to Prudential and Tokio Marine in respect of the Appellant. For the purposes of the Appellant’s negligence claim, there is no need for us to come to a finding on whether the Respondent acted in bad faith in this regard. But, the contents and the tone of the correspondence from the Respondent suggest, at the very least, that it did not provide the information set out in its reference check responses in an objective manner (
cf Spring (HC)
 and 
Spring (HL)
 at, respectively, [69] and [71] above; see also 
Cox
 at [88] above).
Our decision on the question of breach of duty
141    In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the Respondent did breach its duty of care to the Appellant in its provision of the information set out in the Prudential Reference Check Form as well as in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS.
Whether causation has been made out
142    This leaves us with the third issue: whether the Respondent’s breach of its duty to the Appellant caused Prudential not to hire him.
143    We begin with the observation that the exercise of establishing causation should not be unduly technical or pedantic, and is largely a matter of common sense (see 
The Cherry and others
 
[2003] 1 SLR(R) 471
 at [68] and 
Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2688 v Rott George Hugo
 
[2013] 3 SLR 787
 at [38]). We also note Lord Lowry’s observations at 327 of 
Spring (HL)
 that in the context of a claim of negligence on the part of a former employer in preparing a reference for an employee, “the plaintiff only has to show that by reason of that negligence he has lost a reasonable chance of employment (which would have to be evaluated) and has thereby sustained loss … he does not have to prove that, but for the negligent reference, [the prospective employer] 
would
 have employed him” [emphasis in original].
144    In the court below, the Judge expressed the tentative view that causation had not been made out because Prudential had in fact made a conditional offer of employment to the Appellant on 16 June 2011, and had thereafter applied for a RNF licence for the Appellant from MAS on 12 August 2011. The Judge was of the view that this showed that Prudential had not been affected by the contents of the Respondent’s reference check response.
145    The Respondent argues that the Judge was correct. It asserts that it is clear from the chronology of events that Prudential had: (a) considered the Respondent’s reference check response and their subsequent correspondence; (b) conducted its own internal review and checks on the Appellant; (c) considered the explanation and input from the Appellant, including what was stated in his statutory declaration; and (d) then made the assessment that the Appellant satisfied MAS’s Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria, before deciding to make him a conditional job offer and thereafter apply for a RNF licence for him. The Respondent argues that Prudential’s decision to eventually withdraw its RNF Licence Application and not employ the Appellant was a business decision which it made in view of the conditions that MAS intended to impose before it would grant the Appellant a RNF licence. The Respondent contends that this was a 
novus actus interveniens
 which broke the chain of causation between: (a) its making of the various statements in the Prudential Reference Check Form as well as in the subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS; and (b) Prudential’s eventual decision not to employ the Appellant.
146    The Respondent’s submission ignores and overlooks Mr Tay’s evidence that Prudential ultimately decided not to hire the Appellant not because of the conditions that MAS intended to impose on the Appellant’s RNF licence or for any other reasons, but because of the delays and the lengthy process of clearing the Appellant’s job application and applying for a RNF licence for him. Mr Tay said as follows when he was examined by Mr Thuraisingam:
Q.
Could you explain to the court why Prudential withdrew the application?
A.
I was called upon by my senior boss.
Q.
Senior boss meaning?
A.
The chief distribution officer.
…
 
A.
Together with my immediate boss, which is the chief agency officer and he conveyed a message, 
the process is too long-drawn, the process has been hanging there for quite some time so Prudential decided to withdraw the application
.
Q.
What caused the process to be so long-drawn?
A.
I think basically, first and foremost, I think in my own opinion, I think it’s the reference check and all those things, searching for information, things like that, and also because [the Ramesh Organisation] is quite a big group. I think we wanted to make sure we go through a very robust screening process. So I think – because I understand that [the Appellant] made contact with my colleague, Sean Ang, prior to me joining Prudential on 28 May 2011 … 
So I believe the negotiation has started way in advance, probably early 2011 and all the way until end of the year.
[emphasis added]
147    In the light of Mr Tay’s evidence, it is evident that Prudential’s eventual decision not to hire the Appellant arose from the delay in getting the Appellant approved, and causation would be made out if the Appellant can establish that the time which was taken to process his application to join Prudential was as extended as it became because of the information provided by the Respondent, in breach of its duty of care, in its reference check response to Prudential as well as in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS.
148    In our judgment, the causal link is amply made out. The entire process that Prudential went through in its attempt to hire the Appellant before it withdrew its RNF Licence Application on 15 December 2011 spanned a period of almost seven months. It cannot be disputed that the process took a far longer time than a normal application for a RNF licence would have taken. The issue that the parties dispute is whether this delay was 
caused
 by the Respondent’s reference check response to Prudential and the information which it subsequently provided to Prudential and MAS.
149    The delay in question can be analysed in two parts:
(a)     The first is the delay of almost three months between mid-May 2011, when the Appellant applied to be Prudential’s representative, and 12 August 2011, when Prudential applied for a RNF licence for the Appellant.
(b)     The second is the delay of between three and four months from 12 August 2011, when Prudential submitted its RNF Licence Application, until the date, sometime between 9 November and 15 December 2011, when MAS informed Prudential that it would issue only a conditional RNF licence to the Appellant.
150    Looking at the evidence and the chronology of events, we are satisfied that both periods of delay can be attributed to either the Respondent’s reference check response to Prudential or the further information conveyed by the Respondent in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS. We begin with the first delay of three months from mid-May to 12 August 2011.
151    It is clear from Prudential’s repeated requests, on 7 June, 21 June and 18 July 2011 (see [24], [26] and [28] above), for further information on the persistency ratios and the compliance issues mentioned in the Prudential Reference Check Form that it was concerned about those two issues. Yet, the Respondent was not forthcoming with the information that was necessary to enable Prudential to properly assess the Appellant’s fitness and propriety and decide whether it was willing to apply for a RNF licence for him. The Respondent either gave limited information in response (specifically, in its replies on 8 and 9 June 2011), or worse, left Prudential and the Appellant hanging for almost a month between 21 June and 18 July 2011, replying only when Prudential sent a chaser. Even then, it did not provide most of the specific information that Prudential had sought (see [28] above). As a result, the internal processing of the Appellant’s application to join Prudential stalled from mid-June to mid-July 2011, and only proceeded when Prudential eventually decided to apply for a RNF licence for the Appellant on 12 August 2011. We accept that in the normal course of events, Prudential would have required some time to conduct its due diligence checks on the Appellant, and it is thus not reasonable to attribute the 
entire
 three-month delay to the information which the Respondent provided in its reference check response to, and subsequent correspondence with, Prudential. But, we are satisfied from the sequence of events, Mr Tay’s evidence at the trial that information from the Respondent was not forthcoming (see [134] above) and the correspondence between the parties that 
a large part
 of this delay of three months can be attributed to the Respondent.
152    We are also satisfied that the delay of three to four months, from 12 August 2011 to sometime between 9 November and 15 December 2011, on the part of MAS before deciding to grant the Appellant only a conditional RNF licence was the result of the information that had been provided by the Respondent. In this regard, we note that based on the evidence, MAS normally takes between seven and 14 days to process a RNF Licence Application. This was the timeframe that had been conveyed in MAS’s acknowledgment email to Prudential when the latter submitted its RNF Licence Application on 12 August 2011 (see [32] above). It was also the evidence of Mr Wong from MAS when he was cross-examined by 
Mr Pillai
, who sought to 
confirm
 that the normal processing time for such an application was seven to 14 days. In addition, this was the position taken by the Respondent in its closing submissions below, as well as in its skeletal submissions on appeal. In these circumstances, we are unable to accept the Respondent’s subsequent submission by way of a letter tendered post-hearing on 4 December 2015, which 
contradicted
 its previous assertions, that MAS’s acknowledgement email to Prudential was only an automated reply and was not indicative of the actual processing time.
153    MAS clearly took far longer than its usual processing time in this case. In our judgment, a reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence that this was because of the information that had been provided by the Respondent. It is significant that the Respondent had successfully applied for and obtained a RNF licence from MAS for the Appellant – without any conditions imposed and without any delay – less than a year earlier on 26 November 2010 following MAS’s introduction of the RNF. There is nothing to show that anything had changed in the intervening period that would have resulted in MAS developing sudden concerns that the Appellant might not be a fit and proper person to carry out Regulated Activities. On the contrary, and as we noted at [121] above, the evidence shows that the Appellant had performed to the Respondent’s satisfaction from the time he joined the company on 26 July 2005 until sometime in late 2010, when the relationship between the two started to deteriorate.
154    Further, the 14 October Letter, which was copied to MAS (see [29] above), and the Respondent’s email to MAS of 9 November 2011 (see [35] above), which contained strong words and allegations as to the Appellant’s integrity and business ethics, would likely have caused MAS to have serious concerns about the Appellant’s fitness and propriety. It is likely that this, in turn, caused MAS to take even longer before it decided, sometime between 9 November and 15 December 2011, that it would issue only a conditional RNF licence to the Appellant.
155    Although we accept that there is a possibility that MAS might have been assessing, or might have assessed, the Appellant based on other sources of information apart from the Respondent, there is no evidence before us to establish that this was indeed the case. Mr Wong from MAS asserted privilege over any other sources of information relied on by MAS and even over whether any other sources existed. He also candidly admitted that he could not recall whether there was any other source. We are satisfied that it is more probable than not that MAS’s concerns were the result of the information that had been provided by the Respondent. In this regard, we find it significant that the “issues of concern” listed by MAS in its letter to the Appellant on 31 August 2012 (see [49] above) were the precise issues that had been raised in the information provided, namely: (a) the “low group persistency and high lapse rate” of the Ramesh Organisation; and (b) the fact that several of the advisers under the Appellant had been disciplined by the Respondent for issues such as “improper sales practices and unprofessional conduct”.
156    In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the delay in the entire process – both in respect of the internal decision-making by Prudential between mid-May and 12 August 2011, and in respect of MAS’s decision-making from 12 August 2011 to sometime between 9 November and 15 December 2011 – has been sufficiently shown to be the result of the information provided by the Respondent. It is also clear from Mr Tay’s evidence that Prudential eventually decided to withdraw its RNF Licence Application for the Appellant 
because
 of this delay. In these circumstances, we find that causation has been made out.
The Respondent’s submissions on proof of loss and damages
157    Finally, we turn to address the Respondent’s submissions that: (a) the Appellant has failed to prove loss and damage as he started running a vegetarian restaurant with his wife soon after resigning from the Respondent and is currently still running that restaurant successfully, and has thus not suffered any loss; and (b) the Appellant cannot rely on the 24-month financial package which was set out in Prudential’s conditional job offer of 16 June 2011 because that was merely a draft and had not been finalised. These two submissions are matters for the assessment of damages stage, when the loss and damage sustained by the Appellant as a result of the Respondent’s negligence, as well as any sums that should be set off against this on account of any earnings of the Appellant since leaving the Respondent, will be determined.
Conclusion
158    For these reasons, we allow this appeal in so far as the Appellant’s claim in negligence against the Respondent in relation to his application to join Prudential is concerned. We find, on the facts, that the Respondent breached the duty of care which it owed the Appellant in providing the information set out in the Prudential Reference Check Form as well as in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS, and this caused Prudential not to employ the Appellant.
159    We further order that this matter is to be remitted to the Judge for damages to be assessed. The Appellant is to have the costs of the appeal and of the trial in respect of only the negligence claim pertaining to his application to join Prudential, but not the negligence claim pertaining to his application to join Tokio Marine nor the defamation and the malicious falsehood claims.
These costs are to be taxed if not agreed, and the usual consequential orders are to apply.",2016-07-27 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Introduction
1       These were an appeal and a cross-appeal against sentences imposed following a conviction entered in a District Court. The accused pleaded guilty to four proceeded charges: (a) one charge of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”); (b) one charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code; (c) one charge of assisting another in carrying out the business of moneylending without a licence under s 5(1) read with s 14(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed); and (d) one charge of using the benefits of criminal conduct under s 47(1)(c) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”). I will refer to these as the “CBT”, “cheating”, “UML”, and “CDSA” charges respectively. The sums involved were considerable – for example, the CBT charge alone involved a sum of $6,370,280.48. Seven other related charges under the Penal Code and the CDSA were also taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.
2       The District Judge sentenced the accused to six years’ imprisonment for the CBT charge; one year’s imprisonment for the cheating charge; one month’s imprisonment and a fine of $30,000 (in default one month’s imprisonment) for the UML charge; and 18 months’ imprisonment on the CDSA charge. The imprisonment terms imposed for the CBT and cheating charges were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a total of seven years’ imprisonment. The District Judge’s grounds of decision are reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Luciana Lim Ying Ying
 
[2015] SGDC 257
 (“the GD”).
3       In their respective petitions of appeal, the Prosecution and the accused raised important points of principle in relation to the sentencing of offenders for the commission of property offences. For this reason, Mr Daniel Gaw was appointed to assist the court as 
amicus curiae
 and tasked with addressing the following two questions:
[note: 1]
(a)     whether the value of the goods, which is the subject matter of a criminal offence, should be pegged to its 
retail value
 or its 
replacement value
; and
(b)     whether the fact that an offender did not derive any pecuniary benefit from a criminal offence is a significant mitigating factor, warranting a substantial sentencing discount.
4       In my judgment, the appeal turned heavily on these two issues. At the outset, I would state that I derived considerable assistance from Mr Gaw’s submissions as well as those of the parties. In particular, I would mention that even though Mr Gaw’s submissions were prepared on short notice, they contained useful expositions of the relevant points of principle in contention and were commendably succinct, cogent, and lucidly organised. The appeals were heard together and dismissed on 5 February 2016.
Summary of relevant facts
5       The facts were concisely set out in the GD as well as the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which the accused admitted to without qualification. At the material time, the accused was working as a relationship manager at Hock Tong Bee Pte Ltd (“HTB”), a company dealing in wine and spirits, where she had been employed since July 2010. It was not disputed that during this time, the accused was being harassed by unlicensed moneylenders over debts owed by a former colleague which she had guaranteed.
[note: 2]
6       As a relationship manager, the scope of her work involved bringing in customers and contacting them to arrange for the purchase of alcohol.
[note: 3]
 Each time a customer wished to place an order, his/her relationship manager would open a sales order which would then be sent to HTB’s finance department for processing. Following this, the relationship manager would arrange for the products to be delivered to the client. Customers were allowed to make payment through a variety of means: cash, cheque, telegraphic transfer, or by charging the amounts to their credit cards. Should they elect to pay via credit card, they would provide their credit card details to their relationship manager, who would then furnish these details to HTB’s finance department and arrange for the payment to be made. As a matter of practice, the finance department never dealt with customers directly – even if the customers were in arrears – but would instead contact the customers’ respective relationship managers to ask that they request that their clients make payment forthwith.
[note: 4]
 HTB would not accept fresh orders from customers who were in arrears.
7       In time, the accused began sourcing for the names and contact details of professionals with a view towards making fraudulent orders for expensive wines and spirits. She did so by relying on old name cards in her possession or by searching the Internet for the contact details of professionals. She submitted these names to HTB’s finance department, which registered these individuals as new customers and processed the orders placed under their names. After this had been done, the accused then sourced for buyers from amongst her existing clientele. The buyers would be asked to make payment directly to her either in cash, by cheque, or by bank transfer to various bank accounts controlled by her. Once the transfers had been made, she would direct HTB’s warehouse to deliver the fraudulently obtained stocks of alcohol to the buyers.
[note: 5]
8       In this way, she was able to gain access to a large quantity of expensive alcohol (14,698 bottles worth approximately $7m), which she sold to her clients. HTB did not receive any payments for the alcohol which were sold in this way. Of the wines and spirits that the accused dishonestly converted to her own use, only 1,102 bottles were recovered from the buyers. For the acts of defalcation committed during this period, the Prosecution preferred two charges of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code, of which they proceeded on the second. This was the CBT charge, which stated that between July 2012 and January 2013, the accused dishonestly misappropriated wines and spirits worth a total of $6.4m and retained the proceeds of sale for her own use.
[note: 6]
9       When HTB’s finance department starting chasing the accused for the outstanding payments for the fraudulent purchases, she provided various excuses. She would say that the payment was delayed or that it would be made soon. Eventually, the accused was banned from conducting any further sales on credit when the total amount of outstanding payments under her customers’ accounts became too large. Faced with this, she decided to use the credit card details of existing customers to purchase wines from HTB directly. On 5 February 2013, she placed an order for wines under a pseudonym and made partial payment of $4,196.68 using one of one of her customer’s credit cards. In so doing, she induced HTB to deliver the wines valued at $9,093.60 to yet another customer to whom she had on-sold the wine. This gave rise to the cheating charge.
[note: 7]
10     As stated above, the accused was the subject of harassment from unlicensed moneylenders during this time. Between 25 March and 3 December 2012, the accused deposited part of the proceeds she had obtained through the commission of the CBT and cheating offences into a bank account opened in her mother’s name. In the same period, the accused used a sum totalling $737,295 of the said proceeds to pay off loans which she owed unlicensed moneylenders. For this, the CDSA charge was brought against her.
[note: 8]
 In May 2012, the accused handed the automatic teller machine (“ATM”) card for her POSB account to a runner of an unlicensed moneylender known only as “Tom”, who had been harassing her. When she handed over her ATM card, the accused was aware that ‘Tom’ was an unlicensed moneylender and that her ATM card and POSB account was to be used by ‘Tom’ to facilitate his carrying out of the business of unlicensed moneylending (see the GD at [14]). This forms the subject matter of the UML charge.
[note: 9]
11     In March 2013, HTB noticed that there were significant arrears in the accused’s clients’ accounts. Suspecting that the accused was being cheated by her clients, HTB’s company manager brought the accused to a police station and a police report was lodged (see the GD at [32] and [33]). Three days later, the accused voluntarily surrendered to the police and informed them of what she had done. This was how the offences came to light. In the course of the ensuing investigations, she provided the police with details of the invoices which had been forged and the identities of the clients to whom she had on-sold the wines.
[note: 10]
 On 21 July 2015, she pleaded guilty to the aforementioned charges and she was sentenced on 20 August 2015.
[note: 11]
The District Judge’s decision
12     Given that it was common ground that the District Judge was correct in ordering that the sentences for the CBT and cheating charges run consecutively, I need only focus on these two offences and the reasons she gave for imposing the sentences that she did for each.
[note: 12]
13     When the parties appeared before the District Judge, the chief point of contention was the methodology to be employed in the valuation of the wines. The Prosecution contended that the value of the wines misappropriated should be pegged to their retail price of $7m. By contrast, the Defence pointed out that the proper valuation of the misappropriated goods should be their cost price of $4.42m instead (see the GD at [18] and [35]). The Defence arrived at this figure by subtracting 37%, which was the mark-up HTB generally applied on their products, from the retail price. This disagreement led to a marked disparity in the sentences submitted for: the Prosecution asked for a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment to be imposed for the CBT charge;
[note: 13]
 the Defence submitted that a sentence of 4.5 years’ imprisonment would suffice.
[note: 14]
14     The District Judge began by placing the issue of valuation in its proper context. She explained that the dispute over valuation was, at the end of the day, a dispute over the appropriate measure of the loss suffered by HTB. This was critical because it affected the court’s evaluation of the harm caused by the offence, which is a “central feature of the law of sentencing” (at [34]). The District Judge accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the retail price of the wines was the “true measure” of HTB’s loss (at [37]). She observed that as a retailer, HTB’s key interest was not in the goods 
per se
, but in the opportunity to sell the goods at a profit (
ie
, at the retail price), and it was deprived of this opportunity because of the accused’s actions.
15     As for the general sentencing considerations raised by the Prosecution, she accepted that the value of the goods misappropriated ($7m) and the length of time over which the offences were perpetrated (1.5 years) were significant aggravating factors. In particular, she observed that the accused had displayed “systematic dishonesty” (at [43]–[44]). However, she found the offences were neither particularly sophisticated nor well planned (at [45]). She also did not consider that there was an egregious abuse of position and trust. She held that the accused did not occupy a position of high authority and was merely a salesperson. Insofar as it was submitted that she had been entrusted with a “great deal of responsibility” because she was given the credit card details of her clients, the District Judge held that this was not relevant because it was the 
clients
, not HTB, who “[had] chose[n] to trust her with their credit card details for payment” (at [46]).
16     As for the mitigating factors, there were three which she highlighted. The first, which she described as the “most significant mitigating factor”, was that the accused “derived no pecuniary benefit” from the commission of the offence (at [49]). She noted, in particular, that it was undisputed that the charges framed under the CDSA stated that the sums of money she received were used to pay debts owed to illegal moneylenders. Second, she placed significant weight on the fact that “motivation was not greed” and that it was undisputed that the accused had committed the present offences while labouring under “significant pressure from the activities of unlicensed moneylenders”, as evinced by the fact that the accused and her sister had filed multiple police reports complaining of harassment (at [50]). She emphasised that the accused was 
not
 herself the borrower, but was instead a trusting friend who had agreed to stand as guarantor for a loan taken out by a former colleague. She would not have considered this to be a mitigating factor otherwise. Third, she gave credit to the accused for cooperating with the police. She accepted that the accused’s plea of guilt was an expression of remorse, though she noted that it was “quite inevitable” that she would plead guilty, considering the “overwhelming evidence” of guilt (at [51]).
17     Against this background of competing considerations, and considering the sentencing precedents cited, the District Judge held that an appropriate starting point was a nine year imprisonment term (at [48]). However, she gave the accused a one-third discount on account of the mitigating factors cited and imposed a six-year imprisonment term for the CBT charge (at [52]). She ordered that this run consecutively with the one year imprisonment term for the cheating charge, which she considered to be a “separate and distinct” offence which violated a different legally-protected interest (at [64]). In aggregate, the accused received a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment.
The parties’ submissions
18     On appeal, the parties took issue with both the individual sentences imposed by the District Judge for each offence as well as the global sentence that she passed. They each submitted that the District Judge had erred in law and in principle in her assessment of the aggravating and mitigating factors which were raised. The Prosecution submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate; the accused argued that it was manifestly excessive.
The Prosecution’s submissions
19     The Prosecution submitted that the District Judge had erred in holding that the sentence for the CBT charge ought to be a sentence of six years’ imprisonment for three reasons:
(a)     First, she had not given due weight to the extent of the respondent’s abuse of trust. It was argued that the District Judge had conflated the level of trust with which the respondent had been reposed with her seniority. While the accused held the fairly modest title of “relationship manager”, she was given significant responsibilities in relation to the matters concerning the clients under her charge and occupied a high position of trust within the organisation.
[note: 15]
(b)     Second, she had incorrectly found that the offences only involved a low level of planning and were comparatively unsophisticated. The Prosecution accepted that the accused did not employ any specialised technology nor did she operate as part of a syndicate. However, her 
modus operandi
 was sophisticated in another way, as she was an “insider” who had carefully used her knowledge of HTB’s internal processes to her advantage.
[note: 16]
(c)     Third, it was argued that the District Judge had given undue weight to the absence of personal greed as a mitigating factor.
[note: 17]
 While it was accepted that the accused did not commit the offences out of greed, the accused still stood to benefit significantly in the sense that she was able to “extricate herself from an entirely personal obligation by pillaging from her employer” and that she displayed “no qualms about saving her own skin by intentionally causing tremendous loss to [HTB].”
[note: 18]
 It was therefore submitted that the absence of a motive of greed could not be regarded as a significant mitigating factor.
[note: 19]
20     The Prosecution submitted that the District Judge ought to have begun by considering a sentence of between ten to 12 years’ imprisonment for the CBT charge, which could then be reduced to account for the cooperation she had rendered. It was submitted that a sentence between 8.5 and ten years’ imprisonment was appropriate.
[note: 20]
 It was further submitted that the sentence imposed for the cheating charge could be impugned for the same reasons (
ie
, that the District Judge had downplayed the aggravating factors and accorded too much weight to the mitigating factors) and that the sentence imposed for the cheating charge ought therefore to have been an imprisonment term of between 1.5 to two years’ instead.
[note: 21]
 In conclusion, it was argued that a total sentence of between ten to 13 years’ imprisonment was warranted.
[note: 22]
21     As for the accused’s appeal, the Prosecution noted that it was premised on the narrow question of whether the misappropriated goods were properly valued. The Prosecution defended the District Judge’s use of the retail price of the goods by arguing that the retail price represented the sum HTB – as a retailer – expected to receive in consideration, taking into account 
all
 the costs associated with bringing the goods to market and was therefore a true measure of HTB’s loss. To use the cost price of the items as the index, it was submitted, would undervalue the loss suffered as it would not account for, among other things, the costs incurred by HTB in the storage of the wines and spirits, administration, logistics, and the packaging and delivery of the goods.
[note: 23]
The Accused’s submissions
22     The sole ground of the accused’s appeal was that the District Judge had erred in her assessment of the loss suffered by HTB and had, in so doing, imposed a sentence which was manifestly excessive. She put forward two broad submissions. The first was that the District Judge had fallen into error when she used the retail price of the goods as the measure of HTB’s loss. The accused argued that the retail price of an item was variable and it depended heavily on various business exigencies. Therefore, it was submitted that to rely on the retail value of the goods was to open the door to inconsistency in sentencing.
[note: 24]
 Instead, the replacement cost of $4.4m (which she equated with the putative cost price of the wines: see [13] above) was a more reliable index of value, since it was a “historical and commercially accepted value” at which the goods were last transacted.
[note: 25]
 As for HTB’s other pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses (
eg
, the costs of storing the wines etc.), the accused argued that they had not been established and should not be taken into account.
[note: 26]
23     The second broad submission was that the District Judge had overvalued the loss when she failed to consider the value of the 1,102 bottles of wine recovered, which had a total retail value of approximately $526,400 or a replacement value of about $331,600. It was contended that the District Judge ought to have omitted the value of these wines from her consideration of HTB’s loss. By her best case, therefore, the measure of the loss suffered by HTB was not $7m, but just $4.1m (
ie
, $4.4m, which is the value of the goods as denominated in terms of its replacement cost minus the $331,600 worth of wines recovered).
[note: 27]
 The accused submitted that when this revised figure was used as the measure of loss, a much lower sentence of about 4.5 years’ imprisonment was justified.
[note: 28]
24     She relied on the same arguments in submitting that the sentence for the cheating charge ought to be lowered. She argued that the District Judge had incorrectly valued the loss suffered by HTB from the cheating charge as $18,300 (based on the retail value) when it ought to have been $11,500 (by reference to the replacement value). With that in mind, and considering the mitigating factors (chiefly, the fact that she had pleaded guilty and assisted the police), it was argued that a sentence of five months’ imprisonment would have been suitable for the cheating charge, which should have been ordered to run consecutively with the CBT charge for a global sentence of four years and 11 months’ imprisonment.
[note: 29]
25     As for the matters raised by the Prosecution as aggravating factors – her knowledge of the “inner workings” of HTB and her use of the same in order to carry out the offences – the accused’s position was the same as that taken by the District Judge; that is to say, she contended that she was no more than a low-ranking employee who had misused her position to appropriate money which rightfully belonged to her employer. It was submitted that when compared to the precedent cases, the accused’s 
modus operandi
 was “not at all complicated” and the level of trust reposed in her was not so “unusually high” that her offence could be considered an aggravated breach of trust.
[note: 30]
 Furthermore, she submitted that these factors were already accounted for in the fact that she had been charged for the offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant rather than criminal breach of trust 
simpliciter
.
[note: 31]
26     On the issue of motive, she submitted that her case could be distinguished from precedent cases where accused persons were the authors of their own misfortunes (for example, where they had run into financial trouble due to a gambling addiction and therefore had to turn to crime). In the circumstances, she submitted that the District Judge had rightly taken the absence of a motive of personal enrichment into account as a mitigating factor.
[note: 32]
 Emphasis was also placed on the fact that she had only found herself in this situation because of her trusting nature and willingness to help others in need. It was stressed that these offences were committed because she had yielded to pressure and acted out of fear in the face of harassment.
[note: 33]
My decision
27     The main issue was whether the District Judge had erred in sentencing the accused to a term of six years’ imprisonment for the CBT charge. Although the parties also addressed me on the sentences imposed for the other charges, it was not the focus of their submissions and hence I do not propose to comment on the submissions made in respect of the other charges. Having regard to the arguments presented, I approached this central issue by considering the following three key sub-issues:
(a)     Whether the District Judge had erred in using the retail price, rather than the replacement cost, of the misappropriated goods as a measure of its value (“the valuation issue”);
(b)     Whether the District Judge had erred holding that the fact that the accused was not motivated by a desire for personal enrichment and the fact that she did not derive any pecuniary benefit from the commission of the offences were significant mitigating factors which warranted a substantial sentencing discount (“the pecuniary gain and motive issue”).
(c)     Whether the District Judge had erred in concluding that the CBT offence did not involve a high level of planning and that it did not involve a breach of a significantly high level of trust (“the level of trust and sophistication issue”).
28     When I reflected on these three key issues, it seemed to me that the valuation issue pertained to an analysis of the 
harm
 caused by the offence; the latter two – the motive and the trust issues – were relevant to a consideration of the accused’s 
culpability
. As I explained in 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn
 
[2016] 3 SLR 269
 at [19], “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence, whereas “culpability” is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. These are the two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime. After considering the three sub-issues, I will examine the adequacy of the sentence for the CBT charge by comparing it with the relevant precedents.
The valuation issue
29     At the outset, I will state that I agree with Mr Gaw’s submission that in order to determine the approach which should be taken towards the valuation of the goods, one first has to appreciate the purpose and relevance of the exercise.
[note: 34]
 In this connection, it is vital to appreciate the distinction between the function the valuation exercise plays in the 
charging
 process and its role in the 
sentencing
 process.
The role of the valuation exercise at the charging stage
30     In order to provide some context, brief mention of the procedural history of the case is necessary. In the court below, the issue of valuation was raised even before the accused’s plea was recorded. When the accused’s matter was first mentioned on 25 May 2015, counsel for the accused objected to the fact that the amount reflected in the CBT charge was the retail price rather than the cost price of the goods. It was argued that the mark-up applied by HTB was ten and 20 per cent, and not between 20 and 30 per cent, as the Prosecution had contended. It was submitted that this was a matter which would have a crucial impact on sentencing and that if it could not be resolved, a Newton Hearing might have to be convened. The District Judge elected not to record the accused’s plea of guilt on that occasion and adjourned the matter for three weeks to give the parties an opportunity to discuss the issue.
[note: 35]
31     Shortly before the matter was restored for hearing, the Prosecution filed a set of submissions to address the question whether, for the purposes of the CBT charge, the goods misappropriated ought to be valued at the retail price or the purchase price of the goods.
[note: 36]
 It was submitted that it ought to be the former because the retail price of the goods was a “convenient and logical starting point” and represented the “closest and most practical solution to determining the benefit gained by the accused and the loss suffered by the victim as the result [of] the criminal conduct.”
[note: 37]
 The accused did not file any submissions in reply and it appears that she was content to have the matter taken up at the sentencing stage, where she continued to maintain that the cost price of the goods, rather than its retail price, ought to have been used instead.
[note: 38]
32     I pause now to say that I agree with the Prosecution that the general rule should be that the retail price of the goods ought to be the value reflected in the charge.
[note: 39]
 When one is particularising a charge, the chief aim is to put the accused on notice of the details of the offence for which he/she has been charged. Section 124(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) specifies that a charge must contain such details of the offence as are “reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what he is charged with” and s 124(2) of the CPC states that where the offence of CBT is concerned, the gross sum in respect of which the offence has been alleged to have been committed, together with the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, must be stated. The retail price of the goods is a reasonable indicator of their worth and is therefore sufficient to give the accused details of the offence for which he has been charged. It should generally be adopted as the indicative value of the goods unless to do so would be grossly misleading. In this connection, it is important to be mindful that charges are often particularised by police officers at an early stage of investigations. Ascertaining the value of the goods should therefore not be an overly complex or difficult exercise.
The role of the valuation exercise at the sentencing stage
33     The role that valuation plays in the sentencing process is different. The value of the goods is a useful 
proxy
 for the harm caused by the offence. But it is, at best, only a rough measure for it suffers from two significant limitations. First, it reflects only the harm to the 
victim
, and not to wider society. However, any assessment of the “harm” caused by the offence must take into account the wider interests of society. For example, the misuse of funds meant for a charitable purpose and the concomitant loss of public confidence in charitable institutions that arises therefrom has been taken into account in the sentencing of offenders for the commission of CBT (see 
TT Durai v Public Prosecutor
 
[2007] SGDC 334
 at [124]–[125] and 
Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2010] 4 SLR 258
 at [93]). Second, it is only a measure of the 
financial
 losses suffered by the victim and does not take into account the non-pecuniary losses (
eg
, emotional distress) which have been sustained. For example, the New South Wales Criminal Court of Appeal held that in measuring the loss suffered by a victim, the court would have to consider the “value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money 
or in terms of sentimental value
” [emphasis added]: see 
Re Attorney-General’s Application (No 1) under s 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act; R v Ponfield; R v Scott; R v Ryan; R v Johnson
 [1999] NSWCCA 435 at [48(viii)]). Thus the value of the goods stolen should not be viewed as the sole measure of the victim’s loss, let alone the full extent of the harm occasioned by the commission of the offence.
34     However, as long as these two caveats are borne in mind, it is generally useful to have regard to the value of the goods in the sentencing process, for it provides a convenient yardstick against which the seriousness of the offence may be benchmarked against the precedent cases. It must be stressed that the valuation exercise is carried out from the 
victim’s
 perspective, because its object is to ascertain the level of harm caused to the victim.
35     The Prosecution had submitted, citing the decision of the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Ascroft

”) at [60], that the test ought to be what it would “have cost the accused to obtain legitimately the goods he obtained dishonestly”. I do not agree. The issue in 
Ascroft
 was whether the sum the accused was ordered to pay under a confiscation order issued under Criminal Justice Act 1988 (c 33) (UK) was excessive. That turned on the wording of s 71(1A) of the said Act, which provided that the amount an offender is ordered to pay under a confiscation orders shall be equal to “the benefit in respect of which it is made”. This adopts the perspective of the 
offender
 and is concerned with the 
benefits
 the offender might have obtained through criminal conduct. It is immediately clear that the differing contextual concerns affect both the reference point of the inquiry (the offender, rather than that of the victim) and its substance (the benefits obtained by the offender, rather than harm caused to the victim). Thus, I concluded that the 
Ascroft
 approach was not an appropriate guide here.
36     To the extent that the court is concerned with ascertaining the value of the 
financial
 losses suffered by the victim, different approaches to valuation must be taken depending on the context. This was a matter which both Mr Gaw and the Prosecution agreed on.
[note: 40]
 To illustrate this point, I found the case of 
United States v Wasz
 450 F.3d 720 (7
th
 Cir. 2006) (“
Wasz
”) to be particularly instructive. The accused persons (the Waszes) had conspired with their co-defendants to sell goods which had been stolen from various home improvement and building supply stores around the country on the online website, “eBay”. For this, they were charged with wire fraud. On appeal, they argued that the loss to the retailers should not be quantified by reference to the retail prices of the stolen goods, but at the much lower prices at which they were transacted on eBay. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, reasoning as follows (at 727):
The district court was on firm ground in using the retail value of the stolen merchandise fenced by the Waszes as the benchmark in estimating the loss. Other courts have recognized that when the stolen merchandise at issue has been taken from retailers, the price at which the retailers would have sold that merchandise serves as a reasonable estimate of the loss. ... In this case, the merchandise stolen was ready for sale and, in fact, had been offered for sale by the retailers; the Waszes' co-defendants literally took the merchandise off the retailers' shelves and out of the stores, bypassing the cashiers on their way out. 
The retailers would have already incurred virtually all of the costs associated with the sales of these items and were simply waiting to ring up the sales.
 In that regard, there is no dispute between the parties as to the prices at which the retailers would have sold the merchandise to willing customers. Under these circumstances, it was entirely reasonable for the district court to use the total retail value of the stolen items as a 
reasonable estimate of the loss
. … [emphasis added]
37     I will return to the point about the incidental costs incurred in the sales of the items later. For the present, it cannot be gainsaid that the court must attend to the facts of particular cases in deciding how the process of valuation should be carried out. In particular, regard must be had to the use to which the misappropriated goods had been put in order to consider what the appropriate index of loss should be. Mr Gaw gave several useful examples of situations in which the court’s approach to valuation might differ depending on the context. I gratefully adopt two of them, albeit with some modifications and amplifications, and set them out below for the purpose of illustration:
(a)     Where the goods in question were possessed by the victim for his own use and enjoyment, rather than for sale, the replacement cost of the item (whether it be the cost of an identical item or its closest available substitute) is generally a good measure of the loss. An example of such an item is a mobile phone. The victim’s interest lies in the use of the item itself so the cost of obtaining a suitable replacement is both the fairest and simplest way of ascertaining his loss.
(b)     Where the goods were intended to be sold in the ordinary course of business, the sale price of the item should generally be used as the measure of loss. I have deliberately used the expression “sale price” in order to emphasise that what is being referred to is the price that the goods would normally (if it had not been stolen) have been sold at. If the victim is a retailer, the sale price will be the retail price; if the victim is a wholesaler, the wholesale price ought to be used. This reflects the fact that the loss to the victim consists largely of the fact that he is no longer able to sell the item – the “opportunity cost”, so to speak, of the misappropriation of the items.
38     The two scenarios outlined above are useful rules of thumb. Mr Gaw posited that where the goods in question were intended to be sold but are unlikely to have been, the court would have to make a judgment as to whether the cost price of the item(s) or its retail price was more appropriate.
[note: 41]
 I accept this point, and think that it serves to reinforce the general principle that loss must always be measured “within the factual circumstances presented” (see 
United States v Machado
 333 F.3d 1225 (11
th
 Cir. 2003) at 1228). The evaluation of harm, like many other things in the sentencing process, is a matter which is quintessentially suited for case-specific judgment, and not general legislation. I would not seek to place any finer a point on this save to say that for most cases, the retail price of the goods is generally a good gauge of the loss suffered by the victim.
Conclusion on the valuation issue
39     I turn now to the facts of this case. HTB is a retailer of wines and spirits and it was in the business of selling the alcohol. Its interest lay not in the alcohol 
per se
, but in the sum it would have received from their sale. In misappropriating the goods, the accused had deprived HTB of the 
opportunity
 of selling the goods at their retail price. This was the proper measure of HTB’s loss. I also considered that the District Judge was entirely justified in taking into account the costs of bringing the goods to market (“rental, marketing, manpower, packaging, transportation et cetera”: see the GD at [37]) as a further reason for using the retail price. As the court in 
Wasz
 pointed out, the retail price is a “reasonable estimate” of the loss suffered by a retailer because it also reflects the margin that merchants would have to add in to reflect the overheads incurred in the handling of the goods (see [36] above).
40     I rejected the accused’s argument that the replacement value of the goods ought to have been used as it was a more stable measure of value. As a general point, the replacement value of the goods – insofar as it is measured as the cost of purchasing a suitable replacement in the market – is as vulnerable to market fluctuations as its current retail price.
[note: 42]
 Insofar as the accused suggested that the cost price (which I would stress is not necessarily the same as the replacement value of the goods) should be used, I would also reject this.
[note: 43]
 The “cost price” of the alcohol would be an extremely imprecise measure of the actual cost of replacement in this case. The alcohols misappropriated by the accused comprised several expensive wines and spirits. It was not clear when the goods were bought by HTB but it would be reasonable to infer that the cost of replacing them today (assuming replacements could in fact be found) would be far higher than their cost price and the profits from their sale would be concomitantly lower.
41     The accused’s other argument was that the measure of the harm caused should be reduced to reflect the value of the bottles of alcohol recovered. I did not accept this. At the time the appeal was heard, it was unclear whether the buyers or HTB was entitled to possession of the bottles, and it was anticipated that a disposal inquiry would have to be conducted. Either way, as the Prosecution rightly pointed out, someone would suffer loss, whether it would be HTB (which lost out on the opportunity of selling the alcohol) or the buyers (who paid the accused for the alcohol and had not been reimbursed) is quite irrelevant. The recovery of these bottles did not affect the extent of harm that was caused by the commission of the offence.
[note: 44]
42     At the end of the day, when the court exercises its sentencing function, its task is to assess, as best it can, the losses which had been caused by the criminal act in order that it might impose, by reference to that, a condign punishment. To that end, it need not strive for absolute accuracy and the loss “need not be determined with precision” (see 
United States v Miller
 316 F.3d 495 (4
th
 Cir. 2003) at 503). The District Judge’s use of the retail price of the goods as a yardstick for the loss suffered by HTB was entirely reasonable and in accord with common sense. In my judgment, the District Judge was correct to consider that the measure of the victim’s loss would be appropriately pegged at $6.4m and I was not persuaded by the accused’s attempt to impugn the sentence on this ground.
The pecuniary gain and motive issue
43     The relevance in sentencing of the absence of personal pecuniary benefit was the second of the two issues posed to Mr Gaw. From the outset, I should note that the parties agreed on the following two propositions:
(a)     First, while there was some dispute over whether all the proceeds of sale of the misappropriated alcohol went to the discharge of the debts the accused owed the unlicensed moneylender (“UML”), the accused had not committed these offences for the sake of personal enrichment.
[note: 45]
(b)     Second, the 
factual
 absence of personal pecuniary benefit was not, without more, of particular relevance to the question of sentence (see 
Narindar Singh so Malagar Singh v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 3 SLR(R) 318
 (“
Narindar Singh
”) at [60]).
[note: 46]
 Instead, the specific question before the court was whether the fact that the offences were not committed for personal financial gain was a mitigating factor.
[note: 47]
44     I am in broad agreement with how the parties had framed the matter. It was clear to me that the absence of factual benefit (to broaden the inquiry from pecuniary benefit to include all forms of benefits, whatever form they might take) was neither here nor there. For example, if an offender intended to cause and does cause wrongful loss but is apprehended before he could realise the profits of his illegal acts, it is clear that this cannot count in his favour (see, eg, 
Ding Si Yang v Public Prosecutor and another appeal
 
[2015] 2 SLR 229
 at [64]). What is controversial is whether it makes a difference that no personal benefit accrued 
because
 the offender was not motivated by a desire for personal benefit and did not set out to obtain one in the first place. I will first consider the cases on the subject before turning to consider the specific context of the offence of CBT as a servant. Finally, I will consider whether the District Judge had erred in her application of the principles to this case.
The role of motive in the sentencing process
45     It is a deeply intuitive feature of moral reasoning that it matters not just 
what
 offence was committed, but 
why
 it was done. Taking motives into account in the sentencing process allows the court to distinguish between the relative blameworthiness of individuals who might be liable for the same criminal offence. For example, the commission of an offence for personal gain has been held up as an aggravating factor (see 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
 at [51]), as has been the commission of an offence out of malice or spite (see 
Lim Siong Khee v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 1 SLR(R) 631
 at [21])), or an offence which is motivated by hostility towards a particular racial or religious group (see s 74(1) read with 74(4)(
b
) of the Penal Code). On the flipside, it has been recognised that “those motivated by fear will usually be found to be less blameworthy” (see 
Zhao Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] 4 SLR(R) 879
 at [37] (“
Zhao Zhipeng
”)) and in “exceptional” cases, the fact that the offence was motivated by a desire to satisfy a pressing financial need might also be considered a mitigating factor (see 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor
 
[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406
 at [10]).
46     However, it is less clear whether the 
absence
 of a particular motive – in this case, a desire for personal enrichment – can be a mitigating factor. Mr Gaw submitted that the cases appeared to go both ways. On the one hand, there are three cases where the absence of a motive of personal gain appears to have been taken into account as a mitigating factor: 
Seaward III Frederick Oliver v Public Prosecutor
 
[1994] 3 SLR(R) 89
 (“
Seaward III
”), 
Foo Siang Wah Frederick v Public Prosecutor
 
[1999] 1 SLR(R) 996
 (“
Foo Siang Wah
”), and 
Ong Beng Leong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 1 SLR(R) 766
 (“
Ong Beng Leong
”). On the other hand, there are also two decisions of the District Court where the absence of a motive of personal enrichment seems to have been held as not being of any mitigating value: 
Public Prosecutor v Lim May Cheng
 
[2004] SGDC 85
 (“
Lim May Cheng
”) and 
Public Prosecutor v Ooi Lye Guan
 
[2005] SGDC 228
 (“
Ooi Lye Guan
”).
47     However, closer reading of these cases will reveal that the position is less than conclusive. In both 
Seaward III
 at [31] and 
Foo Siang Wah
 at [57], the courts made little more than passing reference to the fact that the offenders were not motivated by personal gain without much elaboration of how it might have been relevant as a mitigating factor. As for 
Lim May Cheng
 (at [323]) and 
Ooi Lye Guan
 (at [32]–[34]), the point which was made was 
not
 that the lack of a pecuniary motive was not a mitigating factor. Rather, the emphasis was on the fact that accused persons did not, at the end of the day, benefit from the commission of the offences. This was not a mitigating factor that warranted a sentencing discount. Indeed, it should be noted that both the district judges in question cited [58] of 
Narindar Singh
 where Yong Pung How CJ said that “there is no inflexible rule that an accused who derives no personal benefit from a corrupt transaction should automatically be entitled to some sort of discount on his sentence.” It is implicit in this statement that the absence of personal benefit 
might
 be relevant to the sentencing process.
48     In summary, the cited cases do not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the 
absence
 of a motive of personal enrichment is a mitigating factor that invites a substantial sentencing discount. However, I do not think that should surprise. In many matters in sentencing, it is often impossible to lay down a universal rule to govern a diverse range of situations. In this regard, it is useful to recall the remarks of Choo Han Teck J in 
Public Prosecutor v Huang Hong Si
 
[2003] 3 SLR(R) 57
 at [8], where he said:
What have frequently been labelled as “aggravating factors” are, therefore, more accurately factors that 
indicate the level of gravity of the crime in specific relation to the offence upon which the accused was charged
. The degree of seriousness at each level differs according to the individual facts of the case. Such facts are not intended to be used to compare the crime of robbery with the crime of rape, for example. They are to be used to engage the court in the exercise of establishing how the offender is to be punished 
within the range of punishment prescribed for him for that offence
. …
49     Although these remarks were made in relation to aggravating factors, I consider that they are equally apposite in a consideration of mitigating factors. A mitigating factor serves to indicate the relative seriousness of a crime in “specific relation to the offence upon which the accused was charged.” The court can only assess the relevance of the offender’s motive 
in the context of the specific offence for which he has been charged
 and in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case as part of a holistic evaluation of the accused person’s culpability. It is simply not possible to say, in the abstract, whether the fact that the accused did not commit the offence for personal gain makes it less serious. The answer to this must depend on a myriad of factors.
50     The case of 
Ong Beng Leong
 is instructive to illustrate the holistic approach taken by the courts towards questions of motive in the sentencing process. The offender was a commanding officer in the Singapore Armed Forces who had awarded several maintenance contracts to a company, “SH”, without first sourcing for alternative tenders, as was required under prevailing tender guidelines. In order to cover up this fact, SH prepared forged quotations which were prepared in the name of other companies and backdated to give the appearance that these quotations had been received before SH started work. The offender signed and approved these documents. For this, he was charged and convicted for the offence of using false documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Yong Pung How CJ dismissed his appeal against his conviction but allowed his appeal against his sentence. At [60], Yong CJ said:
… The offences which the accused was 
convicted of could in fact be described as partly technical
. 
There was never any suggestion by the Prosecution that the accused had been motivated by pecuniary gain.
 Indeed, the 
evidence suggested that the accused had honestly believed, albeit misguidedly, that he was expediting the works for the benefit of TRMC and the SAF. There was also no indication that the accused had actively participated in the scheme to submit false quotations
, which distinguished his case from those of Ong and Khoo. In my view, although his acquiescence in the Maintenance Department’s practice was deplorable, it did not warrant such a substantial custodial sentence. … [emphasis added]
51     The fact that the offender was not motivated by personal profit was not analysed in isolation, but as part of the broader examination of the facts and circumstances of the offence. It was stressed that the present case was less serious in absolute terms from usual cases of corruption (which he said were always “serious”: at [59]) because the infractions here were “partly technical”. It was never suggested that the offender had deliberately sought to cheat his employer. Rather he had, perhaps unwisely, had sought to circumvent what he thought were needless bureaucratic requirements. There was no suggestion that he was ever in cahoots with SH to turn a profit and in this sense, his transgressions were far less serious than that of the other two other employees of SH who stood personally to benefit from the cover-up and were therefore more culpable (at [60]). For the same reason, his offence was also less serious than that of offences which are usually prosecuted under the PCA, which are usually actuated by greed and marked by dishonesty.
52     To summarise, I would view the absence of a motive of personal enrichment not as a general mitigating factor 
per se
, operating across the entire spectrum of cases, but as a factor which could, 
in the right circumstances
, mitigate the seriousness of an offence when 
compared to
 other possible offences of like nature. Where an offence that would ordinarily be committed because of an aggravating motive (such as personal gain or indulgence in a social vice) is committed because of a less culpable motive (
eg
, to help others or out of fear) then the 
absence
 of that aggravating motive could be taken into account by the court as a factor that warrants the imposition of a lower sentence. An example of this is the case of 
Ng Yang Sek v Public Prosecutor
 
[1997] 2 SLR(R) 816
. The offender there was a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine who was convicted of trafficking in a staggering quantity of opium (nearly 17.5kg, or nearly 15 times the amount which would attract the mandatory death penalty) and sentenced to death. On appeal, his conviction for trafficking was set aside and replaced with a conviction for drug possession for which he was sentenced to only two years’ imprisonment on account of the fact that he possessed the opium not to perpetuate the vice of drug abuse, but for a therapeutic purpose (at [51]).
53     This is consistent with the approach taken in the United States Sentencing Commission, 
Guidelines Manual
 (Nov. 2015) (“US Sentencing Guidelines”) where a sentencing reduction is applied in certain cases if it can be shown that it was committed without any intention of personal gain (see Carissa Byrne Hessick, “Motive’s Role in Criminal Punishment”, (2006) Southern California Law Review 80 at p 110). Two examples include the offence of smuggling, transporting, or harbouring of an unlawful alien (at §§ 2L1.1–2L2.1 of the US Sentencing Guidelines) and the offence of criminal infringement of copyright or trademark (at § 2B5.3 of the US Sentencing Guidelines). A defendant can expect to receive a reduced sentence where he did not commit the offences for personal financial gain. In these cases, motive distinguishes between more serious instances of the offence in question (
eg
, human trafficking) from those which may be less serious.
54     I am mindful of the general principle that the absence of an aggravating factor is not itself a mitigating factor (see 
Public Prosecutor v AOM
 
[2011] 2 SLR 1057
 at [37]). My remarks should not be taken as a licence for offenders to cite the absence of an aggravating motive as a basis for a sentencing discount in 
every
 case. Instead, the court must have regard to the nature of the offence in question (and, in particular, to the targeted mischief) and to the general profile of the median offender in deciding whether this is a factor which warrants a sentencing discount. I also stress that even if it were considered a mitigating factor, the weight that is given to it will differ according to the facts. Ultimately, it must be stressed that sentencing is not a mechanistic process, but a “fact-sensitive exercise in judicial discretion which involves balancing a myriad of considerations” (see 
Kho Jabing v Public Prosecutor
 
[2016] 3 SLR 135
 at [92]). With these points in mind, I now turn to consider the specific context of the offence of CBT.
Absence of pecuniary gain and the offence of CBT as a servant
55     The offence of CBT is made out whenever there has been the dishonest misappropriation of property. Instances of CBT run a wide gamut but in all its various forms, it involves the transgression of two distinct legally-protected interests. The first, which it shares in common with other property offences, is the protection of the victim’s property rights. The second is the protection of the standards of probity, integrity, and right-dealing which the law expects of persons placed in positions of trust. When an offender commits CBT he commits a double wrong: not only has he dealt with property which did not belong to him as if it were his own, he has done so when the property in question was given to him with the expectation that he would only use it within the scope of his authorisation.
56     An offender who breaches this obligation for the sake of personal enrichment is appreciably more culpable than one who does not. This is so in both absolute and relative terms. At its core, the offence of CBT is about the breach of loyalty and confidence and all other things being equal, it is a more deplorable breach for a person in a position of trust to apply the entrusted properties purely for personal gain than to have applied it for an alternative unauthorised purpose. Furthermore, the vast majority of CBT offences involve the flagrant abuse of one’s position for personal enrichment at the expense of one’s principal. Thus, an accused who 
does not
 commit CBT for personal gain is less culpable, relatively speaking, than the median CBT offender.
57      
Public Prosecutor v Lim Lee Eng Jansen
 
[2001] SGDC 188
, though not a case involving the offence of CBT, is instructive. The offender was the senior manager of a bank who had used his position to extend additional credit to a company, K, a long-time customer of the bank. The offender did so by manipulating the bank’s records to record that K had used less credit than it actually had. K eventually defaulted on its repayments and the bank lost $5m in unpaid loans. The offender was charged and he eventually pleaded guilty to four charges of falsifying accounts under s 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed) (“1985 Penal Code”). The unchallenged mitigation was that the offender had done so out of a “misguided sense of altruism” to help K out in its time of need and that he had not obtained any direct pecuniary benefit for this. Pointing to this, counsel for the appellant submitted that the case ought therefore to be distinguished from two precedent cases in which the offenders had resorted to various means to cover up the losses sustained and had also committed various acts of misappropriation for personal pecuniary benefit. I accepted this submission and held as follows (at [22]):
An important distinguishing factor in the present case was that the fraud perpetrated by the accused was only indirectly connected with his own interests. There was no evidence that the accused stood to gain from his misdeeds in pecuniary terms. Like the first accused in 
Sabastian s/o Anthony Samy
, it could be inferred that he may have acted to protect his own reputation. 
But it would be incorrect in principle to equate the circumstances in the present case with instances of theft, criminal breach of trust or misappropriation where the offender is typically actuated by greed and/or personal gratification.
 This was evidently not the case here. … [emphasis added]
58     My point then, which I reiterate here, is that an appreciation of the context is crucial. The offence of falsifying accounts covers a multitude of transgressions, and the precise reasons for the falsification matter deeply. I did not consider that that case was even remotely comparable not just to the two cited precedents, but also to other offences involving CBT or related property offences in which avarice, self-interest, and greed feature prominently. I also considered that the offender had cooperated fully with the police after being arrested, had a clean record and, by all accounts, was not likely to reoffend after being released. Bearing these points in mind, as well as the fact that the offender had already spent two months in remand, I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment on each charge and ordered that both run consecutively for an aggregate sentence of three months’ imprisonment. The appeal was subsequently dismissed.
The role of motive in this case
59     The District Judge characterised the present case as one in which the accused was placed in her predicament not by personal design, but because of her trusting nature. It was not disputed that she became the victim of harassment by UMLs because she decided to stand as guarantor for her colleague and it was only because of the harassment that she turned to crime. The observations she made at [1] of the GD are apposite in highlighting the significance of the absence of pecuniary gain as a mitigating factor:
The unchallenged mitigation was that [the accused] had obliged an ex-colleague by standing as guarantor for his loans from loan sharks. When the ex-colleague defaulted on payment and disappeared, the loan sharks started to threaten her and commit acts of harassment at her residence. She succumbed to their pressure and committed the offences of criminal breach of trust and cheating against her employer to pay them. There was no pecuniary gain to her.
60     In response, the prosecution submitted that the absence of any motive for personal gain could not be a “significant mitigating factor”. First, it was contended that while the accused was not motivated by personal enrichment, she certainly 
stood to benefit
, as she applied the proceeds in discharge of the debt she owed the UML, thereby reducing the sum of her indebtedness at the expense of her employer. Second, they pointed out that the accused had persisted in her offending by turning to credit card fraud after her account with HBT was suspended because of the large arrears accruing on her clients’ accounts. Third, it was argued that the District Judge had “glossed over” the tremendous losses sustained by HBT, which eclipsed whatever mitigating weight may be accorded to the absence of a pecuniary motive.
[note: 48]
61     I accept the Prosecution’s point that the accused stood to benefit from her offence. However, the most that could be said about this was that she had committed the offence 
for her own sake
, and that this case should therefore be set apart from situations where offenders were said to have been driven by purely altruistic motives. The accused was not arguing that she should be given credit for being altruistic. Instead, her plea was to be treated less harshly than the usual run of the mill CBT offender, who is usually motivated by avarice. The fact that the accused had turned to credit card fraud was neither here nor there. In any event, the use of the credit cards formed the subject matter of a separate charge and I did not think it fair to also count this as an aggravating factor for the CBT charge. As for the scale of the losses, the District Judge had made specific mention of this (see [15] above) and I saw no basis for the conclusion that she had somehow “glossed” this over.
62     The District Judge attempted to draw a parallel between this case and that of 
Zhao Zhipeng
, whom she said had also committed the offences under “significant pressure”. With respect, I was not persuaded that the cases are all that alike. In 
Zhao Zhipeng
, the offender (a foreign national who played in a local football club) was convicted of match-fixing. The evidence showed that the club manager was a domineering person and the accused, who had recently moved to Singapore from China, was afraid of antagonising him, particularly since the manager had intimated that he had triad connections in China and would hurt the offender and his family if he did not follow his instructions to fix the matches. In the circumstances, the court held that the offender’s capacity for independent action was diminished and so his culpability for the offence was at the “lower end of the scale” (at [39]). It is critical to note that the charges of match-fixing which the offender in 
Zhao Zhipeng
 faced related to offences committed within the span of a month. In those circumstances, it is conceivable that the offender could have been so much in fear that his will was overborne by the circumstances. By contrast, the present offences were committed over a span of 1.5 years. While the accused might always have feared harassment from the UMLs throughout, I did not think it could be said that her capacity for independent action had been curtailed to the extent that it could be held up as a particularly compelling mitigating factor. Nevertheless, I accepted that she was under continued pressure and her sense of helplessness had contributed to her offending.
63     In summary, I found that the District Judge was correct in saying that the facts of this case are unusual and the sentence could not readily be benchmarked against cases where the offenders committed the offences for personal gain. On the undisputed facts, the absence of any motive or desire for personal enrichment rendered her offence of CBT as a servant less serious and blameworthy than a case where the offender was so motivated. In these circumstances, the District Judge was entitled to find that her culpability was significantly reduced and to afford her an appropriate sentencing discount.
The level of trust and sophistication issue
64     Finally, I turn to the level of trust and sophistication issue. The Prosecution’s essential point was that the accused’s offences were more calculated, the level of perfidy much higher, and her acts of deception more practised than the District Judge recognised. While it was admitted that the accused used simple techniques (Internet searches and the use of old name cards) and worked alone, this did not necessarily mean that the scheme was not carefully planned. Among other things, it was argued that “the sophistication of the [accused’s] scheme lay in the keeping up of multiple ruses on multiple fronts”: to the finance department, the warehouse department, and the clients to whom she sold the wines.
[note: 49]
 It was also stressed that the accused had to rely on her intimate knowledge of HTB’s internal processes in order to pull this off, which attested to the high level of trust reposed in her.
[note: 50]
65     I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that in determining the level of trust reposed in a person, the court looks to substance and not to form; thus, a person with a humble title may occupy a high position of trust (see 
Public Prosecutor v Teo Cheng Kiat
 
[2000] SGHC 129
 at [26]). Likewise, I accept that a criminal scheme may be said to be “sophisticated” and “carefully orchestrated” even if it did not involve the use of complicated technology and was carried out by a single operator working alone, rather than a syndicate.
[note: 51]
 In all cases, what is critical is not the intricacy of the criminal enterprise 
per se
, but whether there were careful steps taken to 
avoid detection
. Such conduct is aggravating because it is evidence of purposeful offending (which is more blameworthy) and because it often leads to greater harm (see 
Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334
 at [42]). However, even with these two points in mind, I could not accept the Prosecution’s submission that the District Judge had erred in her appreciation of the accused’s culpability, as disclosed in the manner and mode of her offending.
66     The District Judge’s conclusion, upon a review of the evidence, was that the accused was essentially a sales executive dealing with incoming corporate sales queries (see the GD at [46]). I accepted that this was a fair characterisation of the facts. While the accused had knowledge of HTB’s internal workings, there was nothing in the SOF that suggested that she knew anything more than sales employees in similar companies would have known or that she had been entrusted with any special level of responsibility. Further, there was also nothing in the recitation of the facts which suggested that the manner of her offending was carefully calculated to avoid detection. On the whole, the facts revealed no elaborate criminal design, but only the efforts of an opportunist whose methods were simple and uncomplicated. When the finance department inquired about the arrears, she was only able to, in the Prosecution’s words, “stave them off with various excuses”. There was no evidence that she took any particular steps to avoid detection.
67     I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the accused had clearly used her position in the company to commit the offences. As was rightly pointed out, while the customers were the ones who provided their credit card details to the accused, they did so 
because
 she was an employee of HTB.
[note: 52]
 However, this fact alone did not mean that she was in any elevated position of trust. At the end of the day, the District Judge rightly recognised that the accused was a sales person whose scope of work included the collection of payments and that she sometimes did so by using credit card details which had been given to her by her clients (see the GD at [46]). The fact that she had abused her position as an employee to perpetrate the offences was already accounted for in the fact that she had been charged for CBT as a servant, which carries a higher maximum punishment, rather than the offence of CBT 
simpliciter
. It should not be held up as an aggravating factor (see 
Soong Hee Sin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 1 SLR(R) 475
 at [16]).
Sentencing precedents
68     As far as the precedents were concerned, the Prosecution cautioned against reliance on the older cases and submitted that there had been a “clear upward trend in the sentences for such offences in recent years”. They drew my attention to the following three decisions of the District Court – 
Public Prosecutor v Lee Han Boon Adrian
 (DAC 911016/2014 and others), 
Public Prosecutor v Koh Mui Hoong
 (DAC 500714/2013 and others), 
Public Prosecutor v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew
 
[2011] SGDC 425
 (“
Matthew Yeo
”) – all of which involved the misappropriation of between $1m and $2m and in respect of which sentences of between five and six years’ imprisonment were imposed. Extrapolating from this, they submitted that the starting point of nine years’ imprisonment arrived at by the District Judge was too low and that a starting point of between ten and 12 years’ imprisonment ought to have been ordered instead.
[note: 53]
 With respect, I could not agree with this.
69     There is no question that the amount of money misappropriated is an important sentencing consideration. Generally, the larger the amount misappropriated, the more severe the punishment that should be meted out. However, it has been emphasised in past cases that while the punishments imposed for CBT offences ought to increase in severity with the amounts misappropriated, the sentences “do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved” (see 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Cheng Yew and another appeal
 
[2013] 1 SLR 1095
 (“
Tan Cheng Yew
”) at [184]). The fact that proportionately higher punishments were imposed for offences involving smaller sums of money does not, without more, imply that the District Judge had selected an inappropriate starting point or that the eventual sentence she arrived at was manifestly inadequate. I also did not think it possible to derive a sentencing range from such a small sample size (particularly considering the circumspection with which unreported decisions are generally viewed: see 
Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor
 
[2010] 1 SLR 707
 at [21]).
70     When I turned to consider the precedents cited, there were four which I found particularly helpful. In terms of 
modus operandi
 and level of culpability, I considered 
Matthew Yeo
 to be comparable. The offender was an accounts manager for the local telecommunications company, M1. He falsified more than 3000 subscription contracts over the period of two years in order to induce the delivery of handsets (purchased at the subsidised prices available to new subscribers) which he on-sold at their retail price. The offender spent the money he made on luxury items like cars, watches, and bags. The total loss to M1 was assessed to be $2m. The offender pleaded guilty to nine charges, comprising two charges of CBT as a servant and several charges of converting property which represented the benefits of criminal conduct under the CDSA. He received a sentence of five years’ imprisonment for the CBT as a servant charge, which was ordered to run consecutively with the sentence of one year’s imprisonment for one of the CDSA charges, resulting in a global sentence of six years’ imprisonment.
71     In terms of the quantum, the closest precedents which were cited were the cases of 
Joachim Kang Hock Chai v Public Prosecutor
 (DAC 156/2003, unreported) and 
Public Prosecutor v Kwek Chee Tong
 
[2001] SGDC 194
. The former involved the misappropriation of about $5.1m of church funds for personal gain. Some, though not all, of the money was returned to the church. The offender pleaded guilty to a charge of CBT 
simpliciter
 under s 406 of the 1985 Penal Code after 13 days of trial and was sentenced to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. The latter involved the misappropriation of $5.49m of which $2.6m remained unaccounted for. The offender had committed the offence in order to pay off debts incurred while gambling and had taken elaborate steps to hide his misdeeds. For this, he was charged with multiple counts of CBT under s 409 of the 1985 Penal Code. He was convicted after a lengthy trial in which he had convicted his defence in an “extravagant and unnecessary” manner, which resulted in an adverse costs order being made against him. After observing that the offender displayed little remorse, the trial judge sentenced him to a total of nine years’ imprisonment.
72     I also had regard to the case of 
Tan Cheng Yew
 which, though far more aggravated in many respects, also provided a useful point of reference. The offender, a lawyer, had misappropriated nearly $4.8m worth of his clients’ money and was on the run for six years. After he was caught in Germany, he resisted extradition but was eventually repatriated to Singapore where he stood trial for six charges, four of which were for the offence of CBT under s 409 of the Penal Code (which carries a higher maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment, as compared to a maximum of 15 years’ imprisonment for CBT as a servant under s 408 of the same) and two charges of cheating. On appeal, he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for each of the charges under s 409 of the Penal Code and both were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment.
73     These precedents provided some guidance to a certain extent, but they are of course broad and imperfect reference points. On the one hand, I was mindful that the harm caused by the accused far exceeds that in any of the four cases I have referred to because of the sheer quantum of the loss sustained by HTB. On the other hand, however, the accused was far less culpable than any of the aforementioned offenders, all of whom were motivated by avarice and many of whom led lavish lifestyles with their ill-gotten gains before they were prosecuted. There were many unique features of this case which called out for special attention, such as the absence of a desire for personal gain, the pressure placed on the accused by the harassment, and the cooperation she rendered the authorities in the course of the investigations. When I considered the facts in their totality, it seemed to me that the sentence of six years’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge in respect of the CBT charge and the global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment was neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate.
Conclusion
74     For the reasons set out above, I was not persuaded that there was merit in either set of appeals against sentence. In my judgment, the District Judge had given due consideration to the relevant sentencing considerations and that she had acted within the bounds of the sentencing discretion that was conferred on her. I concluded that there was no basis for appellate intervention and therefore dismissed both appeals.

Introduction
1       This was an appeal against the sentence of six months’ imprisonment imposed on the appellant for each of two counts of abetting a deceitful act in connection with dealings in securities, an offence under s 201(
b
) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the SFA”) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the s 201(
b
) charges”). These charges arose from the appellant’s deceptive use of nominees to circumvent a moratorium imposed by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“the SGX”) on the transfer/disposal of his shareholdings in SNF Corporation Limited (“SNF”). The appellant had pleaded guilty before a District Judge to these as well as various other charges which related to offences dating from 2004 and 2005, when he was a director and substantial shareholder of SNF.
2       After the hearing of the appeal on 29 April 2016, I concluded that there were grounds to allow the appeal against sentence. Accordingly, I reduced the sentence of six months’ imprisonment to four months’ imprisonment for each of the s 201(
b
) charges and ordered the imprisonment terms to run concurrently. I delivered an oral judgment on 25 May 2016, and I informed the parties that I would provide full grounds for my decision, which are set out below. These grounds fully incorporate the observations I had made in my oral judgment.
Factual background
3       The relevant facts are set out in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which the appellant had admitted to without qualification. The appellant became a director and shareholder of Gennex Solutions (S) Pte Ltd (“Gennex”) on 3 February 2000. In late 2002, Gennex, together with a number of other firms in the electronics industry, was approached by one Ng Hock Ching (“Ng”) and Chow Weng Fook (“Chow”) for discussions relating to a proposed merger for the purpose of listing on SESDAQ, the secondary board of the SGX (“the IPO”). SESDAQ is now known as CATALIST.
The listing plans
4       Subsequently, SNF, represented by Ng and Chow, and the shareholders and directors of four interested companies entered into a Business Combination and Shareholders Agreement as well as a follow-up Supplemental Agreement. The four companies were: Gennex, CyberVisions (S) Pte Ltd, Micro Screen Production Pte Ltd and Max Quality (S) Pte Ltd (collectively “the subsidiaries”). Under these agreements, SNF agreed to acquire the subsidiaries and to allot ordinary shares in the capital of SNF to the subsidiaries’ shareholders as consideration. The agreements were made conditional upon SNF obtaining the eligibility-to-list (“ETL”) letter and approval from SGX for admission to the official list of SESDAQ.
5       On 16 February 2004, SNF was granted a conditional ETL and the four subsidiaries were officially acquired by SNF the very next day. Following this acquisition, Ng and Chow were appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of SNF respectively. The appellant was appointed as an executive director of SNF. Pursuant to the SGX listing requirements, the SNF directors (including the appellant) undertook that they would observe a moratorium on the transfer or disposal of their entire shareholdings in SNF for a period of one year after listing as well as 50% of their respective shareholdings in SNF for the subsequent one year (“the moratorium”). The purpose of the moratorium, as stated in SGX’s Listing Manual, was to maintain the promoters’ commitment to the listed issuer and align their interests with that of public shareholders.
The events leading up to the offending conduct
6       Investigations revealed that during one of the meetings held in preparation for SNF’s IPO, Ng suggested to the SNF directors that they could place their shares in the subsidiaries with nominees to circumvent the moratorium. This arrangement would allow the directors to surreptitiously dispose of their SNF shareholdings (received as consideration for their shareholdings in the subsidiaries) through their nominees, right after the IPO if they so desired, without the need to observe the transfer/disposal restrictions imposed during the moratorium period.
7       The appellant approached five individuals (“the nominees”) with the intention of placing his Gennex shares with them. On the appellant’s instructions, each of the nominees signed a share transfer agreement with the appellant on 21 May 2003. The agreement stipulated a transfer of 20,000 Gennex shares to each nominee in consideration for a sum of $20,000. No consideration was paid for the Gennex shares. The understanding was that the Gennex shares would subsequently be converted into SNF shares and sold after SNF’s listing. Thereafter, the nominees were required to channel the proceeds from selling these SNF shares to the appellant. One of the nominees was tasked to receive sales proceeds from the other nominees before transferring the aggregate sums to the appellant.
8       Following SNF’s acquisition of Gennex and the subsequent conversion of Gennex shares into SNF shares, a total of 15,931,900 SNF shares were held by the nominees on the appellant’s behalf. Thus, even though the appellant was the beneficial owner of 25,491,040 SNF shares, his reported SNF shareholding was only 9,559,140 shares (representing only about 37.5% of his actual shareholding). The shareholding information was reported in the SNF IPO prospectus. In preparation for the sale of the nominee-held SNF shares, the appellant introduced his remisier to the nominees to facilitate the opening of their trading accounts with Philip Securities Pte Ltd.
9       After the IPO, the appellant began to dispose his SNF shares held in the nominees’ names. The shares were sold in two tranches — one in the open market between March 2004 and July 2004 and the other through an off-market transaction in January 2005. It was undisputed that the open market sales of SNF shares were carried out on the instructions of the appellant. The proceeds of sale amounted to approximately $5.73m and were eventually channelled back to the appellant. Investigations also revealed that the appellant maintained a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which recorded the nominees’ securities trading account numbers and contained information such as their initial SNF shareholdings, the prices and quantum of the nominees’ SNF share sales and the balances of their SNF shareholdings after each sale between 18 March and 8 April 2004.
10     In carrying out his scheme, the appellant admitted to having: (a) concealed his beneficial ownership of his SNF shares and sold these during the moratorium and had operated a deception on SGX, thereby contravening s 201(
b
) of the SFA; (b) sold his SNF shares and failed to notify SNF and SGX as required under ss 165(1)(
b
) and 166(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”); and (c) failed to notify SNF and SGX of changes in the percentage level of his interests in SNF as required under s 83(1) of the Companies Act and s 137(1) of the SFA.
11     On 24 January 2013, the appellant was charged with 43 offences under the Companies Act and the SFA. Among these charges were five charges under s 201(
b
) of the SFA which pertained to his deception of the SGX. Subsequently, the appellant accepted the prosecution’s offer to proceed with 14 charges should he elect to enter a plea of guilt. These charges included two under s 201(
b
) of the SFA, and the remaining 29 charges were to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
The Decision Below
12     On 3 March 2015, the appellant pleaded guilty to and was duly convicted of the 14 charges that were proceeded with. On 30 October 2015, the District Judge sentenced the appellant to six months’ imprisonment for each of the two charges under s 201(
b
) of the SFA and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. The District Judge also imposed fines for each of the other 12 charges which totalled $118,000.
13     In reaching her decision that a custodial sentence was warranted for the s 201(
b
) charges, the District Judge took the following into account:
(a)     The arrangement was complex and well thought-out to circumvent the SGX-imposed moratorium. The appellant’s acts were blatant breaches and were intended to deceive SGX.
(b)     SGX may not have suffered financial losses but would inevitably suffer loss in reputation and authority if persons who gave undertakings to SGX could then flout SGX’s controls and conditions.
(c)     As a director of SNF, the appellant had a duty of fidelity towards SNF and to the investing public.
(d)     The public at large were the victims and the lack of evidence of victims and losses did not make it a less serious offence.
(e)     The appellant’s acts had undermined the aims of the SFA and given the enormous value involved in the scheme, a mere fine or nominal imprisonment term was insufficient deterrence.
I pause briefly to note that these factors are broadly in line with the sentencing factors laid down by the High Court in 
Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals
 
[2015] 5 SLR 167
 (“
Ng Sae Kiat
”) at [58].
14     As for the appropriate length of the custodial term in respect of the two s 201(
b
) charges, the District Judge calibrated the sentence by reference to the following cases.
(a)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082
 (“
Wang Ziyi Able
”), the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for a charge under s 199(
b
)(i) of the SFA for disseminating false information on an online forum. The District Judge commented that the essence of the appellant’s offence was akin to that of the accused in 
Wang Ziyi Able
 but the conduct of the appellant was more impactful since the appellant was a highly successful businessman and the executive director of SNF (as contrasted with the accused in 
Wang Ziyi Able
 who was merely an individual dabbling in shares).
(b)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Loo Kiah Heng and another
 
[2010] SGDC 434
 (“
Loo Kiah Heng
”), the offender conspired with another person to operate a fraud on the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association (“SATA”) through the use of married trades which allowed the offender to make “contra” profits amounting to $842,353.51. He was convicted on four charges under s 201(
b
) of the SFA read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and sentenced to four months’ imprisonment on each charge with two sentences to run consecutively.
(c)     In 
Ng Sae Kiat
, the offenders took advantage of a “loophole” in the Contracts for Difference system to trade and used nominees’ accounts to circumvent their employer’s prohibition against personal trading by employees. They were convicted for offences under s 201(
b
) of the SFA and were fined sums ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 per charge.
15     In view of the above as well as in consideration of the fact that the appellant had already had this matter hanging over him since 2006, the District Judge eventually decided on six months’ imprisonment for each s 201(
b
) charge and ordered these sentences to run concurrently.
Issues in the Appeal
16     The central issue in the appeal was whether custodial sentences were warranted for the s 201(
b
) charges. The gravamen of the appellant’s case on appeal was that the District Judge had erred in considering the sentencing factors set out in 
Ng Sae Kiat
. The underlying premise of the appellant’s submission was that the decision in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 had changed the previous sentencing norm. According to the appellant, the pre-existing norm was that a custodial sentence was not warranted unless there was a clear abuse of position by professional securities traders at the expense of laymen investors or where innocent members of the investing public had been defrauded. In the alternative, the appellant contended that a custodial sentence was not warranted even if the 
Ng Sae Kiat
 sentencing factors were applicable.
17     The issues that arose for consideration in the appeal were as follows:
(a)     Whether the sentencing factors that were laid down in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 had changed the prevailing sentencing norm for s 201(
b
) offences and if so whether the sentencing factors in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 should nonetheless apply in the present case; and
(b)     Whether a custodial sentence would be appropriate in light of the applicable sentencing norm; and if so, whether the custodial sentence imposed by the District Judge was manifestly excessive.
18     Before turning to the merits of this appeal, it is perhaps appropriate at this juncture to address an issue that was raised on behalf of the appellant during the hearing before me. In essence, counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecution was not entitled to cite in support of their sentencing position particulars of the offence that were not stated in the SOF. More specifically, the argument was that the prosecution could not have relied on unproven and unconceded factors such as “real harm to the confidence of the investing public” when they had not been stated in the SOF or admitted to by the appellant. The appellant’s argument raised broader questions about the nature and objectives of the sentencing process which have been addressed in the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Public Prosecutor v Aniza bte Essa
 
[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327
 (“
Aniza
”). The issue before the Court of Appeal was the extent to which the defence could assert unsubstantiated mitigating factors in order to influence the sentence of the court. In this context, the Court of Appeal endorsed at [60] of its judgment the following comments of District Judge Kow Keng Siong in 
Public Prosecutor v Chan Yoke Ling Catherine
 
[2004] SGDC 108
 (“
Chan Yoke Ling
”) at [37]:
a.    Firstly, the sentencing process and a trial are materially different in terms of their objectives. The reasons for requiring strict proof by admissible evidence of all relevant facts – eg the presumption of innocence – do not apply during sentencing.
b.    Secondly, the usual limitations on evidentiary sources and standard of proof could potentially limit the information available to the Judge, information which is necessary for ensuring that a sentence will adequately and effectively protect, deter and rehabilitate: 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
.
c.    Finally, a heightened burden of proof may also add to the time and resources spent in the sentencing process, and risk turning it into a second trial. Such a spectre is clearly undesirable, as it would result in an inefficient criminal justice process.
19     Just as courts have been prepared to allow the defence more latitude to assert mitigating factors, I do not think that it would be fair or in the interests of justice to confine the prosecution’s sentencing submissions to merely restating what has been included in the SOF. As observed by the Court of Appeal, the role of the court is to ensure that the sentencing process is fair to both the prosecution and the defence, and some degree of flexibility is called for (
Aniza
 at [62]). In any case, it is ultimately the role of the sentencing court to distinguish the wheat from the chaff in giving appropriate weight to sentencing factors cited by both parties (
Aniza
 at [60]). It was also open to counsel to advise the appellant to retract the plea or require a 
Newton
 hearing to be convened at any time before sentence was passed if there were serious disagreements with aspects of sentencing submissions which required proof of specific facts or information which had not been admitted.
20     I accept as a general rule that parties should not stray 
too
 far away from the SOF in making their submissions on sentence (see 
Biplob Hossain Younus Akan and others v Public Prosecutor and another matter
 
[2011] 3 SLR 217
 at [9]). Sentencing submissions by the prosecution following a plea of guilty should properly be circumscribed by the facts contained within the SOF and not attempt to introduce new facts or details which may potentially be contested and have not been admitted to by the accused. Nevertheless, it would be entirely in order to put forward appropriate submissions inviting the court to draw suitable inferences from the facts which have been set out in the SOF.
My decision
Whether Ng Sae Kiat changed the law
21     The mainstay of the appellant’s case was that the decision in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 (which was rendered in 2015) had changed the then-prevailing sentencing norm which was that custodial sentences were only warranted for offences under s 201(
b
) of the SFA and s 102(
b
) of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289, 1986 Rev Ed) (“the SIA”) (the predecessor of s 201(
b
) of the SFA) when identifiable members of the investing public were defrauded and had suffered losses. I will consider the relevant precedents in chronological order. However, it would suffice to state at the outset that while the appellant’s argument seemed persuasive at first blush, I was not convinced, upon closer analysis, that the pre-
Ng Sae Kiat
 sentencing norm was indeed what the appellant had characterised it to be.
22     The first case is 
Public Prosecutor v Cheong Hock Lai and other appeals
 
[2004] 3 SLR(R) 203
 (“
Cheong Hock Lai
”). Three accused persons backdated their applications to purchase units in feeder funds so as to determine the movement of the feeder funds with considerable accuracy. They each pleaded guilty to a charge under s 102(
b
) of the SIA and had another charge under s 201(
b
) of the SFA taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. Further, two of them had an additional charge under s 102(
b
) of the SIA taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The district judge sentenced the accused persons to pay fines ranging between $30,000 and $100,000. The prosecution appealed, arguing that a custodial sentence should have been imposed instead. In dismissing the appeal, Yong Pung How CJ reviewed the cases dealing with charges under s 102(
b
) of the SIA and noted that the common thread in all the cases in which custodial sentences were imposed for offences under s 102(
b
) of the SIA was “a clear abuse of position by professional securities dealers 
vis-à-vis
 laymen investors who came to them for assistance and advice on trading” (at [38]). Such aggravating facts were found to be absent on the facts of 
Cheong Hock Lai
 and the appeal was dismissed.
23     The second case is 
Public Prosecutor v Sia Teck Mong and another
 
[2005] SGDC 249
 (“
Sia Teck Mong
”). The accused persons were directors of ITE Electric Co Limited (“ITE”), a company which was undertaking a share placement under which 5m shares would be offered at a discounted price. The accused persons felt that it would be in ITE’s interests if a friendly party were to take up the 5m placement shares. The friendly party that was eventually identified was a substantial shareholder in ITE and the SGX rules prohibited a listed company from issuing shares through a placement to any of its substantial shareholders. To circumvent this prohibition, the accused persons, together with one Foo, arranged for an acquaintance to subscribe for the placement shares in his own name using funds provided by the friendly party, and to subsequently sell those shares to the friendly party. The friendly party was therefore able to subscribe for an additional 5m shares in ITE at a discount.
24     The accused persons pleaded guilty to one charge under s 102(
b
) of the SIA read with s 109 of the Penal Code. District Judge Aedit Abdullah (as he then was) (“District Judge Abdullah”) found that the arrangement had resulted in a contravention of the SGX’s rules which had been put in place to prevent share placements from entrenching, 
inter alia
, the position of substantial shareholders of listed companies without prior approval from the company’s shareholders and the SGX (at [11]). District Judge Abdullah also found that there was some level of organisation among the offenders, coupled with “a clear intent to mislead the securities house in question” (at [15]). However, he found that there was no indication that the securities house suffered any additional prejudice above being deceived or that there was any damage suffered by anyone else. District Judge Abdullah imposed fines between $100,000 and $150,000 on the accused persons, as he felt that a custodial sentence was not necessitated on the facts.
25     The third case is 
Ng Geok Eng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 913
 (“
Ng Geok Eng
”) in which the accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted of three charges under ss 197(1) and 201(
b
) of the SFA as well as one charge under s 102(
b
) of the SIA. The appellant’s offences stemmed from his use of various trading accounts to illicitly manipulate the share price of a public-listed company. The share trading accounts that the appellant used were registered in his own name, as well as in the names of his wife and his friend. The appellant placed much emphasis on the High Court’s reversal of the custodial sentences for s 201(
b
) offences and reiteration of the point made in 
Cheong Hock Lai
 that for such offences, it was necessary to prove that there was deception of an innocent member of the investing public who suffered losses (at [52]).
26     I pause here to note that the holding in 
Ng Geok Eng
 must be confined to its specific context. What the High Court was dealing with was a distinction between unauthorised trading carried out with and without the account holder’s consent to the use of the account. The latter form of unauthorised trading was regarded to be more serious since detriment is caused also to innocent members of the public whose accounts are misused. Therefore, in the latter form of cases which involves the concordant abuse of investor confidence, a custodial sentence would be appropriate to reflect and befit the gravity of the offence. However, where the account holder consented to the use of the trading accounts, the consideration is less immediate. Given the context in which 
Ng Geok Eng
 was decided (where the use of the trading accounts had taken place with the account holders’ consent (see [41] and [72])), I am unable to agree that the case stands for the proposition that a fine should invariably be imposed in all types of cases brought under s 201(
b
) of the SFA as long as the offence in question does not cause detriment to innocent investors.
27     In order to appreciate a more complete picture of the sentencing norm for market misconduct cases prior to 2015, it is important to also have regard to the decision of the High Court in 
Wang Ziyi Able
. In 
Wang Ziyi Able
, the respondent was charged under s 199(
b
)(i) of the SFA with disseminating information that was false in material particulars on an online forum at shareinvestor.com, without caring whether this information was true or false. In allowing the appeal and sentencing the accused to six months’ imprisonment, V K Rajah JA squarely rejected the argument that a custodial sentence would only be appropriate where innocent lay investors had suffered losses. He stated clearly that “it does not necessarily follow that in the absence of a fiduciary relationship or the offender’s position of authority over those affected, there would not be equally serious consequences” (at [20]). This neatly debunks the appellant’s argument that prior to 
Ng Sae Kiat
, the prevailing sentencing norm for a s 201(
b
) offence was a fine unless identifiable, innocent members of the public had been defrauded and had suffered losses. It is also a salutary reminder that a period of incarceration may be appropriate even in cases where a fiduciary relationship or the offender’s position of authority over those affected is absent on the facts.
28     While the appellant made an attempt to distinguish 
Wang Ziyi Able
 on the basis that it concerned a charge under s 199(
b
)(i) of the SFA as opposed to s 201(
b
) which was what the appellant had been charged with, I was not persuaded that a bright line should be drawn between s 201(
b
) offences and other market misconduct offences. In 
Cheong Hock Lai
, Yong Pung How CJ emphasised that s 102(
b
) of the SIA (the predecessor of s 201(
b
) of the SFA) was a catch-all provision intended to cover any other form of securities fraud not specifically dealt with by other provisions in the SIA (at [41]). Indeed, the above cases illustrate the variety of offences and factual matrices that could be brought under s 201(
b
) of the SFA. Therefore, it may, in appropriate cases, be useful to have regard to sentences imposed for offences under other provisions of the SFA when determining an appropriate sentence for s 201(
b
) offences. It stands to reason that one should not readily assume that a sentence imposed in another s 201(
b
) case would invariably serve as a useful reference point simply because it also involved another offence for which a charge was preferred under s 201(
b
). It also follows that greater care must be taken when making reference to precedents involving s 201(
b
) as a guide to calibrating sentences. To illustrate my point, a case involving the abuse of clients’ accounts to trade for personal benefit would be a rather unhelpful guide for the present case which concerned a deception perpetrated on the securities exchange and which had resulted in the dissemination of false information in the securities market.
29     It is evident from the judgment in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 that the court did not set out to change the law. The court merely confined the decision in 
Ng Geok Eng
 to its context and made it clear that it would be wrong to infer from the relevant case law that the identity of the defrauded party will be determinative of the sentence to be imposed for a s 201(
b
) charge no matter how aggravating the other circumstances may be (at [61]). In the court’s view, crucial aspects of criminality would be passed over without being taken into account for the purposes of sentencing if the focus were to be confined to the identity of the defrauded party.
30     In the circumstances, it would be incorrect to say that the judgment in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 had changed the pre-existing sentencing norm. I agreed with the prosecution that 
Ng Sae Kiat
 merely consolidated existing principles and did not purport to create new law. Further, given the broad range of s 201(
b
) offences and the differing degrees of culpability of offenders, I was not convinced that a common and uniform “sentencing norm” should or can be established across all types of s 201(
b
) offences save for factors that could assist in assessing the public interest at stake which would in turn determine the type of sentence to be imposed. I turn now to explain why I thought a custodial sentence was warranted in the present case.
Whether a custodial sentence was warranted
31     To determine whether a custodial sentence is warranted, the High Court in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 set out (at [58]) a 
non-exhaustive
 list of factors to consider: (a) the extent of the loss/damage caused to victim(s); (b) sophistication of the fraud; (c) the frequency and duration of the offender’s unauthorised use of the relevant account; (d) extent of distortion, if any, to the operation of the financial market; (e) the identity of the defrauded party (
ie
, whether the defrauded party is a public investor or a securities firm); (f) relationship between the offender and the defrauded party; and (g) the offender’s breach of any duty of fidelity that may be owed to the defrauded party. I reiterate that these factors were distilled from relevant precedents and are therefore not new to this area of the law.
32     As noted in 
Ng Sae Kiat
, it is necessary to consider all the facts of the case to determine if the offending conduct in question warrants a custodial sentence. Not all the factors enumerated in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 might be relevant or applicable in every case and in determining the appropriate weight to be given to the pertinent factors, much would ultimately turn on the individual circumstances before the court.
Evidence of loss
33     The s 201(
b
) offences centred on the appellant’s deception of the SGX through deliberate concealment of his beneficial ownership in the SNF shares. Through his nominees, he circumvented his undertaking as a promoter to observe a moratorium on the sale of his shares. The purpose of the moratorium was to maintain the promoters’ commitment to the listed issuer and to align their interest with that of public shareholders. The District Judge found that the SGX (the victim of the deception) suffered loss in reputation and authority. In this appeal, the appellant contended that the District Judge had erred in so finding since there was no evidence to support the finding that the SGX suffered loss in reputation and authority.
34     In so far as SGX was concerned, I accepted the appellant’s point that concealment of such information from the SGX did not necessarily mean that the SGX would inevitably suffer loss of reputation or authority. There was no evidence of any erosion of confidence in the role of SGX as a regulator or any adverse impact on its detection or enforcement mechanisms. On the contrary, the facts suggested otherwise. The offences though not easy to detect were eventually uncovered and consequent enforcement action was taken against the appellant for flouting SGX’s authority and actively concealing information.
35     In so far as the investing public was concerned, there was no material showing any loss suffered. Had there been any evidence of loss, the prosecution would (and should) have brought it before the court. The natural and inescapable inference from the absence of any such evidence was that there was no actual quantifiable loss caused to the investing public. As said in 
Wang Ziyi Able
, “the burden rests entirely on the Prosecution to lead evidence relating to the actual loss to the investing public if it intends to rely on that as an aggravating sentencing consideration” (at [32]).
Market impact
36     In the present factual matrix, it appeared to me that the appellant’s actions were motivated predominantly if not entirely by self-interest and the prospect of personal gain. I did not see a conscious intent or attempt to influence the workings of the market. Rather, it seemed to me that the appellant was indifferent to how public investors might react to the launch of the IPO. As noted earlier, there was no evidence of loss suffered by the investing public or complaints of the public being misled or any tangible adverse effect on investor confidence.
37     I accepted that it was difficult to estimate, let alone quantify, the extent of market impact. The investing public’s choices and decisions are neither uniform, predictable nor always rational; often there are simply too many variables at work. The investing public chose to subscribe for SNF shares despite the appellant having only disclosed that he held 9.5m shares (about a third of his actual shareholding of over 25m shares). The fact that SNF’s post-IPO share prices apparently rose was actually neither here nor there. There could easily have been numerous other considerations. It was not possible to discern any clear correlation and it would be inappropriate to link share price movements to the state of disclosure (or non-disclosure) of the appellant’s shares.
38     In the present case, notwithstanding the lack of evidence of actual quantifiable loss, the investing public was fed misleading information which had the potential to affect their investment decisions. It could be said that the integrity of the market was thus affected by the circulation of the misleading information and the appellant’s misconduct could have had potentially deleterious consequences for the financial market. It was astutely observed in 
Wang Ziyi Able
 that the dissemination of false information can equally disrupt order in the securities market even if it may appear to be less devious and reprehensible than rigging the market (which would in appropriate cases attract sentences of imprisonment (see 
Ng Geok Eng
 at [42])). That having been said, there was no evidence about the materiality of such misleading information or its actual impact on the market. This in no way excuses or mitigates the appellant’s misconduct but I did not consider it appropriate to deem this an aggravating factor in the circumstances.
39     I noted also the prosecution’s concession in the court below that they were “unable to prove … any actual impact in this particular case”. Hence, I could see no cogent basis for their submission that the appellant’s breach of the moratorium “thus had significant implications on the decisions of the investing public regarding any purchase of SNF shares”. The investing public at large could perhaps be regarded as “victims” but only in the broad sense of having been misinformed, but this 
per se
 does not justify a custodial sentence.
40     Further, I did not think that the appellant had owed a duty of fidelity to the investing public in his capacity as SNF’s director and shareholder. The duty of fidelity is most commonly (if not exclusively) discussed in the context of employment law. In 
Ng Sae Kiat
, it was held that “custodial sentences would ordinarily be warranted where employees in a financial institution abuse the duty of fidelity they owe their employer in a premeditated and brazen manner, over a period of time, for personal gains” (at [64]). In the present case, it was accepted by the prosecution that the appellant did not have a legal duty of fidelity to the investing public though he may have had a moral duty that he ought to have observed. In my view, neither can it be said that the appellant owed a legal duty of fidelity to the SGX, the primary victim of the appellant’s deception. The relationship between a director of a listed firm and the SGX is distinct from and cannot be approximated to the relationship between an employee (or ex-employee) and his/her employer. The only duty of fidelity that the appellant could be said to have owed was in respect of SNF (his employer at the material time), the breach of which was not legally relevant to the charges faced by the appellant. Therefore, while the offences revealed grave moral failings on the appellant’s part, I did not think that his duty of fidelity to SNF was a factor that pointed in favour of a custodial sentence.
41     It was not at all surprising that the appellant made much of the lack of evidence of actual market impact. However, before leaving the issue on market impact, it is pertinent to bear in mind that the seriousness of a crime is not only a function of 
the degree of harmfulness
 of the conduct, for one must also consider 
the extent of the actor’s culpability
 in committing the offence: 
Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814
 (“
Law Aik Meng
”) at [33]. As will be elaborated on later in this decision, I found the appellant’s culpability to be demonstrably high considering his motive for personal gain as well as his sustained and painstakingly planned efforts to secure for himself an advantageous position in the market while avoiding detection.
Personal gain
42     I turn to the motivation behind the appellant’s dishonest conduct. It was plain from what transpired that he was motivated primarily if not solely by the prospect of personal gain. The facts revealed that he wanted to place himself in the most favourable position possible to dispose of a sizable majority of his shares as and when he wished. This led him to conceal his actual shareholding from the SGX and appoint nominees with a view to circumventing the moratorium. He may not have known with any certitude how the post-IPO market would move but he was banking on being able to profit. He was both opportunistic and optimistic.
43     A dispute arose as to how the appellant’s personal gain should be quantified. The prosecution (as well as the District Judge) appeared to have pegged the quantum of the appellant’s gain at $5.73m, being the proceeds of sale of the SNF shares. The defence submitted, in the proceedings below, that the appellant only enjoyed a gain of $573,548.40, being the difference between the price at which he sold the SNF shares in breach of the moratorium, and the price at which the SNF shares would have been sold had he complied with the moratorium.
[note: 1]
 On appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant merely converted assets that he had rightfully owned into cash earlier than when he was allowed to do so and proffered an alternative measure of the appellant’s gain — the interest that he would have earned on the proceeds of sale which counsel calculated to be $12,437.98.
[note: 2]
44     I did not think it appropriate as a matter of principle to peg the quantum of the appellant’s gain to the interest he would have gained on the sales proceeds. The appellant had hoped to gain by selling the shares during the period of the moratorium and he certainly did gain handsomely, even having regard only to the amount of $573,548.40 that was quantified by the defence in their submissions below. This gain far exceeds the gains made by several of the respondents in 
Cheong Hock Lai
 and 
Ng Sae Kiat
. In 
Cheong Hock Lai
, the respondents each made total profits ranging from $16,162.32 to $107,925.29. In 
Ng Sae Kiat
, the respondents made profits ranging from $9,000 to $45,000. I note further that the appellant’s gains were not wholly fortuitous. They were not some unexpected windfall for the appellant; they did not flow to him purely by circumstance. To begin with, he was not even entitled to them but for his deliberate contravention of the moratorium. If the post-IPO share prices had fallen, presumably he would have simply bided his time until he felt the time was right to sell, and he would have done so if he deemed it expedient to reduce his exposure and minimise losses.
45     I also recognised that the shares in question belonged to the appellant and he had not wrongfully enriched himself to the tune of $5.73m at someone else’s expense. But he had gained from having engineered for himself the flexibility of cashing out within the period of the moratorium and at opportune times when he was not supposed to have done so. He had the benefit of the sales proceeds in hand while maintaining the impression that he was fully committed to SNF’s shareholders. These were acts of deliberate deception in blatant disregard of the moratorium. I saw no merit in the suggestion that by merely converting shares which he had owned earlier than when he was allowed to do so, this was akin to a mere technical breach. All of his gains were the result of deliberate and calculated manoeuvres, executed with much careful premeditation and planning. These were significant aggravating factors reflecting a serious want of probity.
46     For the sake of completeness, while I considered the appellant’s motive for personal gain to be relevant to sentencing, it was neither useful nor relevant to apply the technical definition of dishonesty in s 24 of the Penal Code in coming to my decision since I considered it established beyond peradventure that the motive for and the quantum of gain were relevant aggravating factors in market misconduct cases. In 
Wang Ziyi Able
, V K Rajah JA stressed that the fact that the offender stood to gain from the gamble of making a false statement was an additional aggravating feature (at [24]). The same point was reiterated in 
Ng Sae Kiat
 where the High Court agreed that personal gain was an aggravating factor that warranted a custodial sentence (at [64]).
47     It is settled law that the commission of an offence for personal gain is generally an aggravating sentencing consideration. My observations are consistent with those made by Yong Pung How CJ in 
Abu Syeed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 182
 at [33] and more recently by Sundaresh Menon CJ in 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
 at [51]. I conclude my observations on this issue by reiterating the importance of examining and making sense of the offender’s motives particularly in the sentencing of property-related offences. This would enable the court to appreciate the relative blameworthiness of individuals who, though convicted of the same criminal offence, might be deserving of different sentences to reflect their differing levels of culpability.
Premeditation and difficulty of detection
48     In my view, the high degree of premeditation and careful planning that went into creating the very elaborate scheme to secure the opportunity for gain while at the same time avoiding detection was a significant aggravating factor in favour of a custodial sentence. It bears noting also that the offences were committed over a rather lengthy period between 2003 and 2005. The appellant had approached the nominees on separate occasions with the intention of placing his Gennex shares with them. The cumulative use of nominee trading accounts, sham share sale agreements as well as the transactions to channel the sale proceeds back to him made the offences difficult to detect. According to the prosecution, the extent of investigations involved 13 financial institutions and eight securities firms and investigators had to go through a large number of electronic materials. There was also a total of 47 suspects; several persons were eventually charged. In these circumstances, I considered the appellant’s offences to reside at the higher end of the spectrum of culpability in market misconduct cases. For deterrence to operate in both the specific and general sense, a clear and unequivocal signal had to be conveyed that such offenders must and would be sternly dealt with.
49     Before moving on to consider whether the District Judge had accorded sufficient weight to the mitigating factors, it would be useful to take stock of what has been discussed above. In essence, I found that the appellant’s offences, in terms of its scale and gravity, were far more serious than those of the accused persons in the precedents that were cited where fines had been imposed. The appellant’s conduct was egregious and should not be lightly papered over. This was not a case where the appellant had merely borrowed his friends’ accounts to trade in shares. He had orchestrated the entire arrangement behind the scenes with a view to circumvent the moratorium which was put in place to protect IPO investors and he had made a handsome gain from his wrongdoing. His deception had also resulted in the dissemination of false information into the market. While there was no evidence of the materiality or impact of the false information, there was nonetheless a strong public interest in deterring market misconduct which distorts the information available to public investors, especially in view of the shift towards a disclosure-based market regime which empowers investors to make informed decisions and to look out for their own interests (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (5 October 2001) vol 73 at col 2128).
Mitigating considerations
(1)   The delay in prosecution
50     There was a substantial delay between the commencement of investigations and the eventual prosecution of the appellant. Investigations began in 2006 and he was only charged in 2013. The appellant argued that “the learned [District Judge] did not accord any mitigating weight to the fact that during the inordinate period of delay from the time that investigations into his case commenced in 2006, to 2013 when the Appellant was first charged, he had fully rehabilitated”.
[note: 3]
51     I had no difficulty in accepting the general proposition that where there has been an inordinate delay in prosecution, the sentence should in appropriate cases reflect the fact that the matter has been held in abeyance for some time, possibly inflicting undue agony, suspense and uncertainty on the offender: 
Chan Kum Hong Randy v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1019
 at [23]. However, it is clear from the District Judge’s grounds of decision that the substantial delay had been taken into account. The sentence was below what the District Judge might otherwise have imposed since she was clearly of the view that the appellant’s misconduct was more egregious than that of the accused in 
Wang Ziyi Able
 (at [30]) but did not choose to impose a sentence that went beyond the six months’ imprisonment term that was imposed there. Accordingly, there was no cogent basis to say that the District Judge had attached insufficient weight to the delay in prosecution. In any case, I would observe in passing that the degree of leniency that should be shown to the appellant to account for the delay in prosecution should be decided with the countervailing public interest in punishing and deterring serious market misconduct in mind.
(2)   The appellant’s cooperation with the authorities
52     The appellant also submitted that the District Judge had failed to consider the “substantial and invaluable cooperation that the Appellant had rendered to the authorities that went well beyond his own confession”.
[note: 4]
 In this connection, the appellant applied by way of Criminal Motion No 31 of 2016 to adduce fresh evidence of his cooperation with the authorities as a further mitigating factor. In essence, the fresh evidence pertained to the appellant’s agreement to testify against his fellow director, Ng, which was scheduled to take place sometime after the hearing of this appeal. The prosecution did not object to the application and it was accordingly allowed but it was also pointed out that the appellant’s cooperation would not substantially assist the authorities beyond the statements he had given on previous occasions to the Commercial Affairs Department.
53     I agreed that the appellant’s cooperation with the authorities including his willingness to testify against his fellow director, Ng, was a relevant consideration. While there was no assurance of the quality of assistance that the appellant may render to the prosecution in dealing with the other connected cases, his willingness to cooperate would be advantageous to the prosecution in dealing with the other connected cases. This did not weigh very heavily in favour of a substantially reduced sentence but it was nevertheless considered in the appellant’s favour.
Conclusion
54     In 
Ng Sae Kiat
, it was observed at [58] that the SFA was intended to achieve 
at least
 the following ends: (a) protect investors; (b) protect public confidence in the market; and (c) ensure that the operation of the market is not distorted. To meet those aims, the SFA must seek to deter an offender from enriching himself (or avoiding losses) at the expense of the market or investors. It must also seek to deter an offender from embarking on a quest for personal gains through fraudulent or deceitful means even where there is no conclusive evidence of significant market distortion or quantifiable impact on market participants.
55     In the present case, the appellant’s motive was personal gain, and his substantial gain was obtained dishonestly through his deliberate contravention of the moratorium and his premeditated scheme to avail himself of the opportunities to sell almost two-thirds of his entire shareholding when conditions were favourable for him to do so. He had deceived the SGX in furtherance of his own self-serving objectives. He had fed misleading information of the extent of his shareholding into the market although I should reiterate that the materiality of such misleading information or its actual market impact remains unclear.
56     I agreed that the imposition of custodial sentences in appropriate cases was necessary to deter potential offenders who might otherwise be willing to risk a monetary slap on the wrist if and when they were apprehended (
Wang Ziyi Able
 at [30]). In the present case, I took the view that there was a need for effective deterrence and that the material before the court amply justified the imposition of a custodial sentence. Had there additionally been evidence of significant market impact and/or actual loss suffered by the investing public, I would venture to suggest that the sentence of six months’ imprisonment was manifestly inadequate as an even greater measure of deterrence would have been warranted.
57     However, having considered the matter in the round, I was of the view that the District Judge had accorded undue weight to certain considerations in sentencing and had thus calibrated the sentence at a level which was inappropriately high. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal against the custodial sentences in respect of the two s 201(
b
) charges. The sentences of six months’ imprisonment were reduced to four months’ imprisonment and I ordered the imprisonment terms to run concurrently.

 Tay Yong Kwang JA:
1       For the s 406 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) charges (Charge 1 and the charge taken into consideration), the District Judge (“the DJ”) accepted (at [38] of 
Public Prosecutor v Prem Hirubalan
 
[2016] SGDC 176
 (“the GD”)) that the Respondent was motivated by desperation and panic and was less blameworthy in using the cheque to pay for the trading losses in order to avoid detection than if he had kept the misappropriated funds for himself. I do not think that is correct. The Respondent committed the offences with only his interests in mind. He wanted to advance his career as a dealer and to benefit financially from the commissions earned on the trades. The parties agreed before me that the rate of his commissions was 0.25% which would work out to be $3,000 to $4,000 based on the total amount of the illegal trades. While the amount in commissions was not huge, his actions were in complete disregard of the position of fidelity in relation to the securities company and to his clients. How could this illegal use of someone else’s money to pay for losses caused by his illegal trades be different from keeping the money for the Respondent’s own use? It was ultimately for his benefit. It is the proverbial robbing Peter to pay Paul situation. The second crime was committed to try to cover up the first.
2       As for Charge 3 concerning the unauthorised sale of Mdm Pereira’s shares, the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment is out of line with the sentencing precedents for similar charges. This is so despite the mitigating factors relied upon by the DJ. Counsel for the Respondent emphasized that there was no loss but he agreed with me that this was not so much a case of no loss to the investor as one of loss having been remedied by subsequent compensation. I accept that the restitution was done swiftly after the illegal acts started to come to light.
3       Charge 4 is in relation to the unauthorized trading in Mdm Ho’s account without the consent of the securities company. Before me, the Prosecution stated that it does not take the position that Mdm Ho did not give consent for the Respondent’s trades. The Prosecution’s stand is that Mdm Ho did not know of the specific trades done by the Respondent. In 
Ng Geok Eng v PP
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 913
, the appellant was an investor who was dealing with his own money and who caused no loss to the account holders who were his wife and his friend who had consented to the use of their accounts by the appellant. The Respondent’s actions in the present case were more aggravating as he was working as a financial professional and had a duty of fidelity to the securities company which employed him. I repeat the point that there were losses in the account but they were remedied subsequently by the Respondent’s mother. There were 46 trades made by the Respondent amounting to slightly more than $1.2m worth of shares over a period of about ten weeks. After considering all the facts of this case and taking guidance from the three judge High Court in 
PP v Ng Sae Kiat
 
[2015] 5 SLR 167
, including the non-exhaustive list of factors set out at [38] of that judgment, I am of the opinion that Charge 4 should also result in a custodial sentence rather than a heavy fine.
4       Some of the mitigating factors put forward were neutral at best. While it is true that full restitution was made by the Respondent’s mother and that the victims suffered no loss eventually from the Respondent’s actions, that was not direct evidence of the Respondent’s remorse. The offences were discovered by the securities company after Mdm Pereira made a report. They did not come to light because the Respondent had owned up to his illegal activities.
5       I accept that the Respondent did not reoffend and that he went on to lead a normal life after leaving Singapore. There was some emphasis by Counsel for the Respondent on the gap of three years between his dismissal by the securities company and his arrest upon his return to Singapore. That delay was due to nobody’s fault. The Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) made a risk assessment at the material time and was of the view that the Respondent might not return to Singapore if he or his family were informed about the investigations. That judgment call made 3 years ago could not be said to be unjustified by simply looking at the Respondent’s behaviour and compliance with CAD’s directions three years later. The CAD did commence its investigations in the meantime during the Respondent’s absence from Singapore. Counsel for the Respondent explained that the Respondent did not return to Singapore during those three years because his father was then working in the Philippines and the family was there with him. However, looking at this issue from another angle, if these proceedings had commenced much earlier, the Respondent could have faced difficulties in securing a place in the university in New York and in settling down in the United States if they resulted in a criminal record for him. Nevertheless, some credit should be given for the Respondent’s clean record for the past five years and the sentences could also take into account the fact that he was under the impression until his arrest in May 2014 that he could put the past behind him after his dismissal from the securities company and the changes that the delayed conviction may cause in his life.
6       Looking at all the facts of this case, I think it was wrong to order the imprisonment terms for Charges 1 and 3 to run concurrently. The net loss in Mdm Ho’s account arising out of the Respondent’s illegal trades was the trigger event but all three proceeded charges involved distinct offences. The Respondent could have stopped the illegal trading, owned up and made restitution after the first offence. Instead, he chose to commit another offence to try to cover up the first. He then decided to commit the third offence to try to cover up the second. From a common sense point of view, the offences could not be regarded as one transaction for the purpose of sentencing as they did not involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest.
7       I therefore allow the Prosecution’s appeal and alter the sentences imposed by the DJ in the following manner:
(a)     Charge 1 – sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment is varied to 
4 months’ imprisonment
. I would have ordered 6 months’ imprisonment but decided to reduce the term by two months to give effect to what I stated in the last sentence of [5] above.
(b)     Charge 3 – sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment is varied to 
3 months’ imprisonment
.
(c)     Charge 4 – fine of $60,000 is varied to 
3 months’ imprisonment
.
8       In my view, on the facts here, including the two charges taken into consideration, all three imprisonment terms should run consecutively to reflect the magnitude of the Respondent’s offending. The aggregate sentence is therefore ten months’ imprisonment with effect from 11 July 2016. The fine of $60,000 which has been paid in respect of Charge 4 is to be refunded to the Respondent through his solicitors since the Respondent is still serving sentence.",2016-08-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment Reserved.
 Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       This appeal arises out of two convertible loan agreements (“CLAs”) which had been entered into between the first Appellant and the Respondent. The first of these was in 2007 (“the 2007 CLA”) while the second was in 2012 (“the 2012 CLA”). Under the terms of the CLAs, the Respondent was to lend certain amounts of money to the first Appellant which were then to be repaid by the issuance of shares in the first Appellant upon its intended listing on the New Zealand (“NZ”) stock exchange. However, the envisaged plan did not come to fruition. In May 2012, the Respondent declared an event of default under the 2012 CLA in that the first Appellant had misapplied the loan proceeds, on the basis of which the Respondent also contended that a cross-default under the 2007 CLA had been triggered. The Appellants, for their part, contended that there had been no misapplication of the loan proceeds under the 2012 CLA; and therefore that the Respondent had improperly declared an event of default under the 2012 CLA and, consequently, that no cross-default under the 2007 CLA had been triggered. The Appellants also brought a counterclaim for damages suffered by reason of the fact that the Respondent’s act of wrongly declaring the event of default had resulted in the first Appellant’s planned listing on the NZ stock exchange being aborted.
2       At the trial below, the judge (“the Judge”) found in favour of the Respondent and dismissed the counterclaim advanced by the Appellants. It is against this that the present appeal has been brought. Apart from the factual intricacies it engages, an interesting point of law is presented: what are the legal consequences that flow if an event of default is found to have been wrongly declared and damages are suffered as a result?
Facts
Parties to the dispute
3       The Respondent, who was the plaintiff in the suit below, is Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd, a venture capital fund incorporated in Singapore which invests in medium sized start-up companies with growth potential. It is managed and owned by Tembusu Partners, a professional fund manager. For convenience, we refer to both Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd and Tembusu Partners as “Tembusu”. Tembusu’s chairman, Andy Lim (“Andy”), and two other key employees, Mahim Chellappa (“Mahim”) and Lee Renhui (“Renhui”), played a key role in the events leading up to the dispute.
4       The first Appellant is ACTAtek, Inc, a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which provides identification management solutions (“ACTAtek”) and the second Appellant is its CEO, Wan Wah Tong Thomas (“Thomas”). They were the first and second defendants respectively in the suit below and are referred to collectively as “the Appellants”.
5       ACTAtek operates through various wholly-owned subsidiaries active in diverse parts of the world and, together, they form a group of companies known as the ACTAtek Group. Thomas established the ACTAtek Group with his business partner, Paul Hung (“Paul”). Apart from Paul and Thomas, there was another director of ACTAtek, Daniel Wong (“Daniel”), who also played a prominent role in the negotiations that are relevant to the dispute.
6       For context, it would also be helpful to identify the third to fifth defendants in the suit below although the claims brought against them were dismissed by the Judge and no appeal has been brought against that.
7       The third defendant was ACTAtek Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the ACTAtek, which was incorporated in Singapore. The fourth defendant was Hectrix, Inc (“Hectrix”), a Cayman Islands company which holds 80.68% of the shares in ACTAtek. The fifth defendant was Thomrose Holdings (BVI) Ltd (“Thomrose”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Thomas owns and controls Thomrose as his personal investment. Together, Thomrose and Paul own 100% of Hectrix.
Events leading to the dispute
The 2007 CLA
8       In 2007, Tembusu was introduced to ACTAtek and Thomas. The parties entered into negotiations for Tembusu to extend a loan of US$1.5m to fund ACTAtek’s research and development with a view to its initial public offering (“IPO”). This led to the signing of the 2007 CLA. Its main terms are as follows:
(a)     Tembusu had the option either (i) to demand repayment of the loan with interest at 10% per annum at any time before 31 March 2008 or (ii) to convert the loan into equity in ACTAtek at any time before its IPO (cl 5).
(b)     ACTAtek was prohibited from using the funds advanced for any purpose other than those stipulated in Schedule 3 of the agreement, unless Tembusu gave its consent in writing (cl 3).
(c)     Tembusu had the right to declare an event of default if any ACTAtek Group company defaulted on the repayment of any other indebtedness or if any obligation falling upon any ACTAtek Group company to repay any other indebtedness was accelerated by reason of an event of default being declared (cl 10.1.10).
(d)     If an event of default occurred, Tembusu had the option to declare the whole of the loan extended under the agreement immediately due and payable (cl 10.3).
9       In accordance with the 2007 CLA, Tembusu disbursed the loan of US$1.5m to ACTAtek but chose not to exercise its right to demand repayment on or before 31 March 2008. As a result, Tembusu was locked into its investment in ACTAtek unless the loan was converted into equity upon ACTAtek’s IPO or if an event of default occurred.
Discussions on further investment
10     Between 2009 and 2011, ACTAtek and Tembusu engaged in discussions over the possibility of a further investment being made by Tembusu but nothing came of this.
11     Sometime between March and April 2011, ACTAtek informed Tembusu that it was negotiating with Ingram Micro (“Ingram”), the world’s largest distributor of computer and technology products, for Ingram to be a promoter and distributor of the ACTAtek Group’s products. Tembusu was also informed that for ACTAtek to successfully leverage upon this opportunity, it would require further funding. Following this, in September 2011, negotiations resumed and Thomas asked Mahim to consider whether Tembusu would be willing to make a second investment in the sum of US$500,000. On 3 October 2011, Thomas emailed Mahim to inform him that of the sum of US$500,000 being sought, US$400,000 would be used for “inventory financing” and US$100,000 would be used for “sales/marketing related expenses”.
12     After further discussions, Tembusu sent a Summary of Indicative Key Terms & Conditions (“the Termsheet”) to ACTAtek on 8 November 2011. This was immediately rejected by Thomas on the basis that the proposed terms were too onerous.
13     Subsequently, on 10 November 2011, Thomas invited Andy, Mahim and Renhui to attend a meeting with representatives of Investment Research Group Limited (“IRG”), the listing sponsor for ACTAtek in New Zealand. The purpose of the meeting was for the IRG representatives to explain the IPO process to Tembusu’s directors. Little emerged in the evidence as to what transpired at the meeting.
14     A few days later, on 18 November 2011, Thomas emailed Andy to arrange a meeting to discuss a further proposed investment from Tembusu in the sum of between S$1m and S$1.5m.
15     On 25 November 2011, Mahim asked Thomas for a breakdown as to how ACTAtek intended to apply the proceeds of the proposed investment. Mahim also asked for a set of detailed financial projections so that the proposal could be put before Tembusu’s investment committee for approval. In response, Daniel sent a forecast on 14 December 2011 to Mahim and Renhui. The forecast contained a note that outlined the anticipated use of proceeds as follows:
 
 
Note:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Utilisation of proceed: SGD1.5mil
 
 
 
 
 
Sales & Marketing Expenses
 
 
SGD 500k

SGD 300k
 
 
IPO
 
 
SGD 200k
 
 
Working Capital
 
 
SGD 500k
 
 
 
 
 
SGD 1.5mil
 
16     After the forecast was sent, Tembusu conducted a due diligence exercise in the course of which it learnt of certain liabilities of ACTAtek to its shareholders and directors. These included unpaid salaries due from ACTAtek to its directors and shareholder loans which had been extended to ACTAtek. As part of the due diligence process, Renhui emailed Thomas, on 19 December 2011, to clarify certain aspects of ACTAtek’s forecast. On the same day, Daniel replied to Renhui’s email, with a copy to Thomas, to address the various queries raised by Renhui. Two of the questions posed, as well as the corresponding replies, are of particular significance in this case. First, the forecast indicated a “Long Term Loan” in the sum of US$716,888. Renhui asked what this was. Daniel replied that US$578,000 represented salaries that were overdue and outstanding to Thomas and Paul for more than a year whereas the remaining US$138,888 was a bank loan. In a subsequent email which was sent from Daniel to Renhui on 22 December 2011, it was clarified that the liability of USD$578,000 pertained only to salaries owing to Thomas and Paul from 2008 to 2010. In that same email, it was noted that there were also salaries due to Thomas and Paul in respect of their work in 2011 which amounted to US$138,769 and US$269,249 respectively. Second, Renhui asked for the details of all shareholder loans that were outstanding and for details on the planned capitalisation of all such loans. Daniel furnished the requested details of the outstanding loans and also stated that these would not be converted into equity, but would be “repaid by cash as most of them are outstanding salary accrual to direct/indirect shareholders”. The shareholder loans were broken down into three categories: (a) USD$768,479 owing to Thomas; (b) USD$464,249 owing to Paul; and (c) USD$292,252 owing to Hectrix. The amount of USD$768,479 which was reflected as owing to Thomas by way of “shareholder loans” comprised his accrued salaries from 2008 to 2011 as well as a short term loan from Thomas to the company. As for the “shareholder loans” owing to Paul, it would appear that the sum of $464,249 consisted entirely of his accrued salaries from 2008 to 2011. We pause to note here that from the correspondence between the parties, they were not always consistent in their usage of the term “shareholder loans”. At times, it would be a reference simply to the cash loans provided by the shareholders while at other times, it would be a reference to both the cash loans 
and
 accrued salaries due to the shareholders. For clarity, unless otherwise stated, a reference to “shareholder loans” in this judgment pertains only to the cash loans and 
not
 the accrued salaries.
17     A due diligence call was then conducted between the parties on 21 December 2011. There are differing accounts as to what precisely transpired during the call although what is undisputed is that the subject of converting the shareholder loans and accrued salaries into equity was discussed. However, no agreement was reached on this point.
18     The principal difficulty in this regard centred on the fact that Thomas insisted upon the issuance of penny warrants to him and Paul as part of the terms of conversion, which would grant them the option to acquire additional equity in the company upon its listing at a nominal price. Mahim, on the other hand, refused to agree to this because he was concerned this would dilute Tembusu’s shareholding after the IPO which was expected shortly. On 5 January 2012, Mahim emailed Thomas asking if he would be amenable to having the shareholder loans converted at certain valuations with the remaining Accounts Payable remaining as debt “with free cash flow used to pay them down”. It is not disputed that the Accounts Payable referred to the unpaid but accrued salaries. Thomas replied on the same day expressing his unhappiness at the fact that Mahim was insisting on a simple conversion without any other form of compensation (
ie
, through the issuance of penny warrants to him and Paul). Thomas then suggested deferring this issue “until IPO time”. This was accepted by Mahim and on this basis, the parties proceeded to finalise the 2012 CLA. We pause to make a couple of brief observations. It is evident that as at 5 January 2012, a day before the 2012 CLA was entered into, Tembusu’s position as reflected in the email from Mahim was that it would not find it objectionable for the Appellants to use “free cash flow” to pay off accrued and/or overdue salaries. What Mahim also made clear was that from Tembusu’s perspective, the shareholder loans, which in this context clearly did not include overdue salaries, were to be dealt with as part of the equity conversion that was anticipated at that time. This in turn was precisely how the Appellants saw it at this stage as seen from Daniel’s email to Renhui on 19 December 2011, just two weeks earlier, which we have referred to at [16] above. In that email, Daniel had specifically intimated that the salaries would be paid from cash. It is beside the point that no agreement was concluded as such at this stage and that the parties decided in effect to defer the issue of equity conversion; what is material is that both parties were operating on the basis that salaries could be paid from available cash.
The 2012 CLA
19     The 2012 CLA, dated 6 January 2012, provided that Tembusu would lend ACTAtek S$1.5m. The salient terms of this agreement are as follows:
(a)     The loan was convertible into shares in ACTAtek upon its IPO at a 50% discount to the issue price of ACTAtek’s shares or, if there was no IPO, at a 50% discount to the value of the shares assessed by two independent accountants (cl 5).
(b)     It was a condition precedent to the disbursement of the loan amount that ACTAtek deliver to Tembusu details of how it intended to use the loan proceeds and an execution plan for its expansion (cl 3.1(d)(ii)).
(c)     It was a condition precedent to the disbursement of the loan amount that the parties execute a supplemental agreement to vary the maturity date contained in the 2007 CLA to 31 December 2013 (“the Variation Agreement”) (cl 3.1(f)).
(d)     Tembusu would have the right to declare an event of default if ACTAtek was in material breach of any of its obligations under the agreement and, provided that the breach was capable of remedy, if ACTAtek failed to remedy that breach within 30 days (cl 8.1(e)).
(e)     As soon as an event of default occurred, ACTAtek would immediately come under an obligation to repay the S$1.5m loan amount together with interest on it at 15% per annum (cl 8.2).
Of significance is the fact that the 2012 CLA 
did not
 contain an express provision, equivalent to cl 3 of the 2007 CLA, which obliged ACTAtek to use the 2012 loan proceeds only for specified purposes (see [8(b)] above).
20     On 6 January 2012, Tembusu sent an execution copy of the 2012 CLA to Thomas for signature. In order to satisfy the condition precedent referred to at [19(b)] above, Thomas prepared a single page document bearing the title “Use of Proceeds” (“the UOP”) which stated four categories of use (“the Four Categories”). The UOP provided as follows:
 
 
Use of Proceeds
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sales & Marketing Expenses
 
 
SGD 300k
 
 
R&D expenditure
 
 
SGD 300k
 
 
IPO
 
 
SGD 200k
 
 
Working Capital
 
 
SGD 900k

21     It should be noted that the Four Categories were essentially derived from the forecast sent on 14 December 2011 (see [15] above), although some changes were made to the values indicated. However, the amendments resulted in a calculation error. When the four figures in the UOP are added up, they amount to S$1.7m instead of S$1.5m.
22     Thomas attached a physical copy of the UOP to the 2012 CLA, signed the CLA, and returned it to Tembusu. Tembusu then proceeded to disburse the loan amounts and nominated one Daniel Lee (“Lee”) to ACTAtek’s board of directors, as it was entitled to do under cl 6.2 of the 2012 CLA.
Events after the execution of the 2012 CLA
23     Subsequently, on 5 April 2012, the parties reached an agreement as to terms on which the outstanding shareholder loans and accrued salaries would be converted or repaid. The shareholder loans were to be converted into equity, while the accrued salaries were to be treated as term loans to be repaid over two years.
24     Shortly after this, in May 2012 Tembusu received ACTAtek’s income statement for the first quarter. The parties’ relationship deteriorated in the aftermath of this. From this income statement, it came to Tembusu’s attention that a sum of about US$260,000 had been paid to Hectrix, (which was the holding company of ACTAtek and was effectively owned by Thomas and Paul) between 11 January 2012 and 1 February 2012. We pause to note that this was just after the exchange of emails that we have referred to at [18] above and the execution of the 2012 CLA and well before the agreement that had been reached in April 2012. Tembusu registered its unhappiness over this payment and sought clarification from Thomas as to the nature of this payment. Daniel replied that this amount, which was owing to Hectrix had been inadvertently omitted from the earlier computation of the shareholders’ loans and accrued salaries and, therefore, ACTAtek had decided to repay a part of the outstanding due to Hectrix. Daniel suggested that the payment could be reversed and be converted into equity. While we have endeavoured to set out what was stated in the emails that were exchanged between the parties, it is not clear to us whether the computation referred to by Daniel is one that was put forward prior to the execution of the 2012 CLA, which appears to us to have included most if not all of Thomas’s accrued salaries, or some other computation that was put forward at the time of the agreement that was reached in April 2012.
25     Tembusu did not respond to this proposal. Instead, on 16 May 2012, Tembusu’s solicitors wrote to ACTAtek declaring an event of default under the 2012 CLA and demanding repayment of the principal amount of the loan together with an amount for interest calculated at 15%, which was charged pursuant to cl 8.2 of the 2012 CLA. It should be noted that the basis on which the event of default was declared was that there had been a material breach of the 2012 CLA in the way in which the funds had been applied. It was only later that Tembusu added a claim against the Appellants on the basis of the tort of deceit. We elaborate on this below.
26     Following these developments, on 24 May 2012, Lee commissioned a special audit which revealed that the 2012 CLA proceeds had been used to pay, among other things, S$74,128.80 worth of the Thomas’ credit card debts and a total of S$171,084, which had been drawn down by Thomas in various smaller sums. These amounts did not come directly from ACTAtek but were instead drawn from Hectrix 
after
 ACTAtek had made the loan repayment in this amount to Hectrix. Tembusu commenced suit on 2 August 2012.
27     ACTAtek contends that the amount which was repaid to Hectrix was in fact accrued salaries that were owed to Thomas for 2011 (“the 2011 Accrued Salaries”). This contention was only advanced after Tembusu had initiated proceedings. Tembusu on the other hand, claimed that this was nothing more than “explanations and excuses raised after the misuse was discovered”. According to Tembusu, Thomas was effectively using the funds of ACTAtek as an overdraft facility for his personal needs. This, however, was not borne out on the evidence. The Judge took the Appellants’ case at its highest, namely that the payment to Hectrix was in fact used to pay the 2011 Accrued Salaries. At the hearing before us, Tembusu proceeded on the same basis. We too therefore proceed on this basis.
The parties’ pleaded case
Tembusu’s case
28     At the trial, Tembusu sought repayment of the loan proceeds under 
both
 the 2007 and 2012 CLAs with interest.
29     There were two aspects to Tembusu’s claim and these may be summarised as follows:
(a)     With respect to the 2012 CLA, Tembusu’s claim rested on its contention that ACTAtek committed a material breach of the 2012 CLA by misusing the proceeds under the agreement and this constituted an event of default under the 2012 CLA. The validity of this claim depended entirely on Tembusu establishing that it was an express, alternatively an implied, term of the 2012 CLA that the proceeds of the loan could only be applied in accordance with the UOP 
and also that
 using the proceeds to repay accrued and overdue salaries would be a breach of such a term.
(b)     As alluded to above, Tembusu also brought a separate claim against the Appellants (including Thomas) for the tort of deceit. This was in some senses separate from the question of whether the UOP had contractual force. It was a standalone claim in which Tembusu contended that Thomas and ACTATek had induced it to enter into the 2012 CLA by a fraudulent misrepresentation. It is important to note that Tembusu was not seeking to rescind the 2012 CLA on this basis but to make Thomas and ACTATek liable in damages.
30     As for the 2007 CLA, Tembusu argued that the event of default under the 2012 CLA triggered a cross-default under the 2007 CLA.
The Appellants’ case
31     The Appellants contended that ACTAtek did not breach the 2012 CLA as the proceeds had been used for purposes contemplated under the agreement. Secondly, they submitted that, even if there had been a breach of the 2012 CLA, this was not 
a material breach
 such as would justify Tembusu declaring an event of default under the 2012 CLA; and on this basis, there would have been no cross-default under the 2007 CLA. On the view we have taken of the case, the second issue namely whether the breach, if any, was material does not arise and we say no more on this.
32     The Appellants also submitted that there had been no fraudulent misrepresentations that induced Tembusu to contract with ACTAtek.
33     The Appellants in turn counterclaimed losses they suffered as a result of ACTAtek being unable to list on the NZ stock exchange. The counterclaim was based on the following causes of action:
(a)     Tembusu had wrongfully repudiated the 2007 and 2012 CLAs which resulted in ACTAtek not being able to be listed on the NZ stock exchange.
(b)     Tembusu had breached an implied term of both the 2007 and 2012 CLAs requiring it to act in good faith, to not act recklessly or negligently, and to take reasonable care and skill when taking any steps so as to enable the ACTAtek to proceed to listing.
(c)     Tembusu breached a tortious duty of care owed to the Appellants in similar terms as stated at (b) above.
(d)     Tembusu and its officers were liable in the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means for conspiring to prevent ACTAtek from listing.
The Judge’s decision
34     With respect to Tembusu’s claim in tort, the Judge found that the Appellants 
were
 liable under the tort of deceit. This was on the basis of two statements which had been made by Thomas (“the Statements”):
(a)     The first statement (see above at [11]) was the email of 3 October 2011 which represented that ACTAtek required funds to invest in “inventory” and “sales/marketing” in order to take full advantage of the opportunity to work with Ingram (“the First Statement”).
(b)     The second statement (see above at [15]) was the statement in the forecast sent on 14 December 2011 which suggested that the 2012 CLA proceeds would be applied to the Four Categories of expenses (“the Second Statement”).
35     According to the Judge (at [45] of the Grounds of Decision (“the GD”)), the Statements conveyed a single fact: that the Appellants had an actual intention, genuinely held at the time the Statements were made, 
to use the 2012 CLA proceeds only in accordance with the specified purposes in the Statements
. The Judge found that this representation was falsely made because Thomas had always intended to use the loan proceeds to pay the outstanding salaries, a purpose which fell outside the ambit of the Four Categories (at [65]–[68] of the GD). Having further found that this representation had induced Tembusu to enter into the 2012 CLA, the Judge concluded that the tort of deceit had been established.
36     As for Tembusu’s claim for breach of contract, the Judge held that although there was no express term in the 2012 CLA which limited the use of the proceeds, there was an implied term to that effect (at [72]–[76] of the GD). By making payment to Hectrix to enable it to repay the 2011 Accrued Salaries, ACTAtek had used the proceeds outside the ambit of the Four Categories and had therefore breached this implied term (at [101] of the GD).
37     The Judge then found that the breach amounted to a material breach of the 2012 CLA (at [105] of the GD), which entitled Tembusu to declare an event of default under the 2012 CLA. The Judge consequently held that the acceleration of the ACTAtek’s indebtedness under the 2012 CLA, before its maturity, triggered a cross-default under cl 10.1.10 of the 2007 CLA.
38     The Judge dismissed the entirety of the counterclaim brought by the Appellants.
39     This led the Appellants to bring the present appeal against the whole of the Judge’s decision. No cross-appeal was brought by Tembusu.
The parties’ arguments
Appellants’ arguments
40     With respect to the main claim, the Appellants raise a multitude of arguments in its grounds of appeal in support of its contention that the Judge had erred in his decision. These are effectively directed at making good the following two contentions:
(a)     that the Judge erred in finding that the tort of deceit had been established; and
(b)     that the Judge erred in finding that there was an implied term restricting the use of proceeds in the 2012 CLA.
41     As for its counterclaim, the Appellants submit that the Judge had erred in dismissing the grounds outlined at [33] above. The Appellants maintain that Tembusu’s wrongful conduct resulted in ACTAtek’s failure to list on the NZ stock exchange and they therefore seek an award for the damages which flowed from this.
42     The Appellants also raise an additional ground in the appeal, for their counterclaim. They contend that Tembusu should be held liable for fraudulent misrepresentation in inducing ACTAtek to enter into the variation agreement. This argument, however, was not pleaded and had not been considered by the Judge below. We therefore decline to consider it.
Respondent’s arguments
43     Tembusu in response submits that the Judge was correct to find that there was an implied term in the 2012 CLA restricting the use of the loan proceeds and that this had been breached. Tembusu also seeks to uphold the Judge’s finding that Thomas had fraudulently induced Tembusu to enter into the 2012 CLA. In addition, Tembusu contends that the Judge should have found that the UOP was in fact an 
express
 term which restricted the use of proceeds to the Four Categories. This last point sought in essence to reverse the Judge’s finding in this issue; but as no cross-appeal was filed by Tembusu, we consider that seeking to reverse the Judge’s holding on this point was not a course that was open to Tembusu (see 
Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and another appeal
 
[2010] 4 SLR 331
 (“
Peter Lim
”) at [26] and [28]; and 
Chiam Heng Hsien (on his own behalf and as partner of Mitre Hotel Proprietors) v Chiam Heng Chow (executor of the estate of Chiam Toh Say, deceased) and others
 
[2015] 4 SLR 180
 (“
Chiam Heng Hsien
”) at [100]). We elaborate on this at [70]–[73] below.
44     Alternatively, Tembusu submits that even if it was not entitled to declare an event of default, the Appellants’ counterclaim would fail because a wrongful declaration of an event of default would not amount to a breach of the 2012 CLA. Further, it contends that the Appellants failed to establish any of the other grounds for their counterclaim.
Our decision
45     We first address the Judge’s determination of Tembusu’s claim which gives rise to two issues:
(a)     whether the tort of deceit had been made out as against the Appellants; and
(b)     whether there was an express or implied term restricting the use of proceeds in the 2012 CLA.
The tort of deceit
46     The elements for establishing the tort of deceit were accurately summarised by the Judge in the GD at [42] (see also 
Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another
 
[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435
 at [14]):
(a)     The Appellants must have made a representation of fact by words or conduct.
(b)     The Appellants must have made the representation with the intention that Tembusu should act upon it.
(c)     Tembusu must have acted upon the representation.
(d)     The Appellants must have made the representation: (i) knowing that it is false; (ii) without any belief in its truth; or (iii) recklessly, without regard to whether it is true or not.
(e)     Tembusu must have suffered damage by acting upon the misrepresentation.
47     In our judgment, the Judge was incorrect in finding that the elements of the tort had been fulfilled with respect to the two Statements. We consider them in turn.
The First Statement
48     An actionable misrepresentation rests upon a statement of past or present fact. An assertion as to the existence of a particular intention or state of mind would amount to a statement of fact. It follows that a 
misstatement
 of the existence of such a state of mind or intention would amount to a misrepresentation of fact (see 
Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd
 
[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307
 (“
Tan Chin Seng
”) at [12], citing with approval the observations of Bowen LJ in 
Edgington v Fitzmaurice
 (1885) 29 Ch D 459 (“
Edgington
”) at 483).
49     With respect to the First Statement, in our judgment, this could not amount to a representation of fact as to the Appellants’ intention in relation to the use of proceeds under the 2012 CLA. This is because the First Statement was made at a time when negotiations for the 2012 CLA had not yet even commenced. To fully appreciate the context in which the First Statement was made, it would be helpful to set out the relevant chronology of the events and the emails that were exchanged between the parties.
50     On 28 June 2011, Mahim emailed Daniel and Renhui, copied to Thomas stating: “I think we should consider doing a pre-IPO raise for Actatek, as that is likely the best way to position the company for a listing that will trade well for late next year or early 2013”. Nothing much transpired after this until 29 September 2011, when Thomas met Mahim and Renhui at an industry dinner where discussions took place between them. The following day, Renhui sent an internal email to Mahim in which he said:
Mahim,
Here’s what I gathered from my conversation with Thomas during the SVCA dinner yesterday:
…
2. Business with Ingram Micro is going well, with Thomas travelling to Thailand to meet the Thai head of Ingram Mircro to introduce their company. He expects that the different geographies will sign up with ACTAtek once they tie up the agreement with Ingram Micro USA. However, he needs capital in order to execute the expansion plan with Ingram, which brought us to the topic of his audit.
51     A few days later, on 3 October 2011, Thomas emailed Mahim to ask whether Tembusu would be interested to make a further investment so that ACTAtek could take steps to leverage upon Ingram’s network:
Further to our short conversation during the SVCA dinner, to assist me to come up with a forecast, is Tembusu ready to invest USD750k or other amount to ACTAtek?
… The fact that we need the cashflow for inventory, sales/marketing investment has been mentioned. 
All we need now is the fund to leverage upon Ingram Micro’s network. So our plan is based on cash available.
[emphasis added]
52     After further correspondence between the two, Thomas then sent the email which contained the First Statement:
Mahim,
As mentioned, the USD500k is mainly for inventory financing USD@400K, and USD100K for sales/marketing related expenses to drive the add-on sales from Ingram and other distributors.
53     On 8 November 2011, Tembusu sent a proposed Termsheet to the Appellants for the proposed investment, which was swiftly rejected by Thomas as being “akin to [a] distress loan” and stating that “ACTAtek [was] not that desperate”. On 10 November 2011, Thomas invited Tembusu’s directors to attend a meeting with IRG so that the anticipated listing process could be explained to them (see above at [13]). It should be noted that the listing process remained an issue in which Tembusu retained a vital interest given that in the circumstances that prevailed at that time, the expected listing represented Tembusu’s only realistic option for exiting from its investment in ACTAtek (see [9] above). It also does not appear to be the case that the meeting with IRG had anything directly to do with ACTAtek’s potential tie-up with Ingram, which was the subject matter of discussions between the Appellants and Tembusu at the time.
54     On 18 November 2011, 
fresh
 discussions commenced between the parties when Thomas wrote to Andy to ask whether Tembusu would be willing to agree to a “proposed investment of SGD 1 to 1.5 million” based upon certain terms. In the course of these fresh discussions, on 14 December 2011, the Second Statement was made to Tembusu. These discussions culminated in the signing of the 2012 CLA (see above at [15]–[18]).
55     It is evident that the context in which each of the First and Second Statements was made was markedly different. While the Second Statement was made during the negotiations which led to the signing of the 2012 CLA, the same cannot be said of the First Statement. During the discussions in the course of which the First Statement was made, the focus was on ACTAtek getting funds to leverage upon Ingram’s network for expansion and in conjunction with this to finance inventory build-up and related sales and marketing. In our judgment, those discussions came to an abrupt end when Thomas rejected Tembusu’s Termsheet on 8 November 2011.
56     This difference in context is further reflected in the fact that when new discussions commenced on 18 November 2011, there was a substantial increase in the amounts being sought. Where the initial discussions had revolved around a potential investment of US$500,000 or US$750,000 the subsequent discussions involved a range that was double these amounts. In fact, by the time the Second Statement was made, the loan amount being discussed was S$1.5m and the 
categories
 of expenses to which the funds were projected to be applied had also developed significantly. As noted above, during the negotiations for the First Statement, the anticipated purposes for the loan were “inventory financing” of around US$400,000 and “sales/marketing related expenses” of around US$100,000, both of which appeared to be related to the anticipated tie-up with Ingram. At the time the Second Statement was made, these had changed to consist of “Sales & Marketing Expenses”, “R&D expenditure”, “IPO” and “Working Capital” (
ie
, the Four Categories). The only common item was “Sales & Marketing” but this was stated to be for a 
lower
 indicated sum in the UOP than in the context of the First Statement. It is not evident that any of these categories related to Ingram.
57     In our judgment, at its highest, one might consider that the negotiations surrounding the First Statement provided some context for the subsequent discussions in the course of which, the Second Statement was made and which led to the signing of the 2012 CLA. However, we cannot accept that the First Statement represented a statement of intention on the part of the Appellants in relation to how the proceeds of the 2012 CLA were going to be utilised.
The Second Statement
58     Turning to the Second Statement, we proceed on the basis that this did amount to a representation of fact insofar as it was an assertion as to the Appellants’ state of mind at that point. In 
Edgington
, the directors of a company issued a prospectus inviting subscriptions for debentures stating that the funds raised against the debentures would be applied to complete alterations to the company’s buildings, to purchase horses and vans, and to develop the trade of the company. In fact, the real object of the loan was to enable the directors to pay off pressing liabilities. The plaintiff brought a claim against the directors for the tort of deceit. In finding that there was an actionable representation of fact, Bowen LJ made the following observations (at 483):
A mere suggestion of possible purposes to which a portion of the money might be applied would not have formed a basis for an action of deceit. There must be a misstatement of an existing fact: but the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man's mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact. Having applied as careful consideration to the evidence as I could, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the true objects of the Defendants in raising the money were not those stated in the circular. I will not go through the evidence, but looking only to the cross-examination of the Defendants, I am satisfied that the objects for which the loan was wanted were misstated by the Defendants, I will not say knowingly, but so recklessly as to be fraudulent in the eye of the law.
59      
Edgington
 aids Tembusu in as much as it explains why a statement as to one’s intention may amount to a statement of fact. But that is as far as it goes. In an action founded on the tort of deceit, it must be shown not only that such a statement of fact was made but that it was 
falsely
 made 
and the maker must have known this to be so or been indifferent to the truth
. The Judge found that Thomas had made the representation knowing it to be false on the basis that he had always intended to use the 2012 CLA proceeds to pay the accrued salaries of ACTAtek’s directors. We begin by observing that even if Thomas did have the intention to use the 2012 CLA proceeds to pay the overdue and accrued salaries, this does not answer the questions whether at the time the material alleged misrepresentation was made, he and ACTATek: (a) knew they were not entitled to do this; (b) knew that Tembusu did not know of this intention; and (c) misled Tembusu into thinking that the 2012 CLA proceeds would not be used for this purpose. Once these points are appreciated, it becomes clear in our judgment that that the Second Statement neither was untrue nor failed to reflect the true intent of the Appellants at the time it was made. It bears emphasis that the anterior question is whether Thomas knew or 
subjectively
 believed that the payment of such accrued salaries fell 
outside
 the Four Categories as stipulated in the Second Statement. As was noted in 
Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another
 
[2013] 3 SLR 801
 at [37], “it is 
the representor’s own (subjective) belief
 that is crucial” [emphasis in original].
60     In our judgment, Thomas 
in fact believed
 that the payment of the accrued salaries fell 
within
 the ambit of “working capital”. In the GD (at [65]), the Judge reasoned that because all the items of expenditure referred to in the Second Statement related to the future, Thomas must have known that “working capital” did not encompass the payment of accrued salaries. We are unable to see the basis on which the Judge arrived at this conclusion and on our consideration of the material that was adduced in the trial and before us, we do not agree with his conclusion.
61     In this regard, we begin with an email exchange which occurred in June 2010, some time before the events that are directly material to the issues in this case, which we consider to be significant. On 23 June 2010, Mahim had inquired why, in ACTAtek’s cash flow statement, a payment of $43,839 to the “Immediate Holding Company” had been reflected. Mahim asked specifically if this was a payment to Hectrix and why it was categorised under “working capital”. Daniel replied as follows:
Hi Mahim,
We transferred funds to Hectrix and then Hectrix will make payment on behalf of ACTAtek.
We categorized under working capital according to Auditor’s Practice.
62     Mahim then asked what the payment “on behalf of ACTAtek” was for. Daniel replied that it was “salary for ACTAtek staff”. Upon receiving this response, Mahim replied:
Hi Daniel,
Ok. Thanks. The way it is written, it looks like it is a repayment of the Holdco Loan. Are you stating that this is not the case? Given that the Company is looking to IPO in the next 1 to 2 years, any holdco/shareholder loans should not be repaid until the IPO, as institutional shareholders would not find that a good precedence.
63     Although it is not clear whether the “salary for ACTAtek staff” pertained to accrued or on-going salaries, Tembusu never sought to clarify this. The only concern that is alluded to in the email exchange is with the treatment of the repayment of 
shareholder loans
 as “working capital”. Once Daniel clarified with Mahim that this was not the case and that what had been described as the “repayment of holding company loan” in fact related to the paying of 
salaries
, Mahim no longer had any objections to this. Therefore, it appears to us that, since 2010, the understanding between the parties was that the repayment of shareholder loans could not be properly characterised as “working capital” but that this did not extend to the repayment of salaries.
64     It falls on Tembusu in these circumstances to show that this understanding had changed by the time of the Second Statement such that the repayment of accrued salaries also was excluded from the ambit of “working capital”. Tembusu contends that during the negotiations for the 2012 CLA discussions, it became clear to both parties that the loan proceeds should not be used to pay off 
either the shareholder loans or accrued salaries
. The evidence, however, does not bear this out. In fact, we are satisfied, on careful consideration of the evidence, that by the time these negotiations were concluded, the position was that both parties appeared to accept that the available cash could be used for the payment of accrued and overdue salaries but not for shareholder loans and we find it especially significant that this is precisely how they had understood the position in 2010 as set out in the immediately preceding discussion. Moreover, it seems that this was also within the ambit of “working capital” as far as these parties were concerned. We return here to the email sent on 19 December 2011 in response to certain questions posed by Renhui in the course of the due diligence exercise. Daniel informed Tembusu that overdue salaries were to be repaid in cash (see above at [16]). We pause to note that this was the communication closest in time to the making of the Second Statement on 14 December 2011. According to Mahim, a due diligence call took place subsequently on 21 December 2011, in the course of which he informed Thomas that he did not want the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to be used to pay off either the shareholder loans or the accrued salaries. Instead, he wanted these sums to be converted into equity after ACTAtek had been listed. As we have noted above, it was far from clear just what had transpired during that call. However, even assuming we were to accept Mahim’s account of the events, this alleged communication took place 
after
 the Second Statement was made and therefore cannot be relied upon to show that 
at the time
 the Second Statement was made, the Appellants:
(a)     intended to use a part of the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to pay overdue salaries; and
(b)     knew that this was outside the ambit of the four permitted categories of expenses.
65     Quite apart from Thomas’ state of mind at the time he made the Second Statement, we do not accept that the parties ever had a common understanding that the accrued salaries were 
not
 to be repaid using the 2012 CLA proceeds. Instead, as we have noted at [18] above, it appears to us that the parties had differentiated between shareholder loans on the one hand and the accrued salaries on the other. We return here to the email that was sent on 5 January 2012 from Mahim to Thomas, some two weeks after the disputed due diligence call and immediately before the 2012 CLA was executed, which supports this conclusion, as evident in this extract:
 
Shareholder Loans on Balance Sheet of $464,070 (under Accounts Payable) and $292,252 under Current Liabilities of Amount due to Holding will be converted to equity.
 We can go with the valuations you suggested before ($9mm as of end of 2008; $10mm as of end of 2009; $11mm as of end of 2010). So a total amount of $756,322 will be converted to equity.
 
The remaining amount of Accounts Payable will remain on the balance sheet, with free cash flow used to pay them down, as we discussed.”
 
[emphasis added]
It should be noted that the “Shareholder Loans” referred to in the email did not include the accrued salaries owing to Thomas and Paul. Rather, these accrued but overdue salaries fell within the ambit of the “remaining amount of Accounts Payable”. This was affirmed by Mahim himself in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. As for the “Current Liabilities of Amount due to Holding”, this was understood to be a loan which was owed to Hectrix. According to Thomas, this amount owing to Hectrix was in fact cash advances which had been made by him.
66     As noted at [18] above, it appears to have been common ground that no agreement was reached on the subject of the equity conversion because of a difference over whether the conversion would incorporate some form of compensation for the shareholders who had financed the group during this time. It was eventually left on the basis that while the shareholder loans would be converted to equity, the precise terms of the conversion would be re-visited closer to the time of the listing. But we reiterate that as far as the salaries were concerned, the position was somewhat different. This is evident from the extract from the email of 5 January 2012 that we have reproduced in the previous paragraph. As noted above, Mahim accepted that the reference to “remaining amount of Accounts Payable” which was to be paid using “free cash flow” included the accrued salaries. Hence he accepted that the Appellants were entitled to repay these sums. His issue was with the source of the funds from which such repayment could take place. He contended that “free cash flow” meant “spare cash which had been generated as a result of the Company’s operation – new retained profits” and was not meant to refer also to the cash injection from the 2012 CLA. While that might have been 
his
 interpretation of “free cash flow”, there is nothing in the contemporaneous evidence to show that this was the common position taken by both parties at that time. Furthermore, it is unclear to us why the Appellants would ever have needed Mahim’s or the Respondent’s agreement to use “new retained profits” to pay off overdue and accrued salaries. In our judgment, the better view on the evidence is that, if anything, the parties were agreed that 
any
 available cash could be used to repay the accrued overdue salaries. Hence, there is simply no basis for concluding that the Appellants did not believe they were entitled to use any available cash to pay overdue salaries; or that they set out to mislead Tembusu to think that they would not use the 2012 CLA proceeds for this basis. In fact it is clear that this was a live discussion and despite this, Tembusu never sought nor obtained any assurance from the Appellants that they would not do this. On the contrary, the parties appear to us to have proceeded on the basis that the payment of these salaries could fall within the ambit of “working capital” even assuming this was a term of the 2012 CLA. We are therefore unable to see how it can then be said that they were fraudulently misled to enter into the 2012 CLA on a mistaken premise.
67     We turn to consider an argument advanced by Tembusu that the subsequent conduct of the parties evinces their common understanding that the 2012 CLA loan proceeds would not be used to repay either the shareholder loans or the accrued salaries. This argument was based on the fact that in April 2012, after the execution of the 2012 CLA, the parties reached an agreement for the repayment terms of 
both
 the shareholder loans and the accrued salaries, and according to the Respondent, this included the 2011 Accrued Salaries (“the April 2012 Agreement”) (see [23] above). The argument proceeds on the basis that it would be inconsistent for the Appellants on the one hand to maintain that they were entitled to repay the accrued salaries with fresh cash and on the other hand to then agree subsequently for these to converted into a loan which would be payable within two years of the IPO. In our judgment, this is flawed for at least two reasons. First, as noted above, in January 2012, there had been a suggestion on the part of Mahim to leave the accrued salaries “on the balance sheet” with “free cash flow used to pay them down”. It was therefore entirely reasonable for the Appellants to have believed that they could use available cash to pay off at least 
some part
 of the outstanding salaries. It would not be inconsistent with this for them to have then agreed for the rest to be settled by the repayment terms agreed upon in the April 2012 Agreement. Second, even if we were to accept that ACTAtek had embarked upon a seemingly inconsistent course of conduct by agreeing to the repayment of the accrued salaries on the terms stated in the April 2012 Agreement if their position was that they had been entitled to pay these from the available cash, there remain other possible explanations for the subsequent conduct of a party that might seem at odds with what it contends is its entitlement under a contract. This is one of the reasons we have been and remain cautious in looking to subsequent conduct when construing the terms of an earlier agreement (see, 
eg
, 
Xia Zhengyan v Geng Changqing
 
[2015] 3 SLR 732
 at [73]–[74]; and 
Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna
 
[2016] 2 SLR 1083
 at [56]). The Appellants contend, first, that whatever might have been the position under the April 2012 Agreement, this did not extend to the 2011 Accrued Salaries. Whether that is so or not, it seems to us that the more fundamental point is that by April 2012, the parties were anticipating an imminent listing and this might well have weighed in the balance from the Appellants’ perspective. In other words, the parties might well have been willing to take a position that was not in accordance with their strict rights given that the end of the road seemed to be in sight. The April 2012 Agreement cannot, in our judgment, be relied upon to establish any common understanding between the parties at the time the 2012 CLA was entered into. This is especially so given, as we have already noted above, that if anything was agreed on this issue at the time of the 2012 CLA, it was that any available cash that ACTATek had could be used for the payment of salaries but not of other loans. The April 2012 Agreement is therefore neutral at best, if it extends so far as to suggest that there was an absence of an agreement even on the issue of salaries at the time of the 2012 CLA. It therefore cannot be the basis for contending that the Second Statement was falsely or dishonestly made.
68     In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the judge erred when he held that the tort of deceit had been made out against the Appellants. We summarise our key findings on this issue:
(a)     The First Statement was not causally connected to the 2012 CLA and therefore could not be relied on as a basis for contending that that agreement had been entered into in reliance upon a fraudulent misrepresentation. In the circumstances there is no need for us to consider other issues such as whether this was an actionable statement or fact and whether it was falsely made.
(b)     As to the Second Statement, we consider that the Statement was not made with the knowledge or belief that it was false. This is so for the following reasons:
(i)       The Appellants believed that the payment of accrued salaries was within the ambit of “working capital. This was a reasonably held belief having regard to the earlier interactions between the parties.
(ii)       In the discussions leading to the conclusion of the 2012 CLA, the parties agreed to defer the matter of converting the outstanding shareholder loans to equity until closer to the time of the anticipated IPO.
(iii)       This however did not apply to accrued salaries generally, or the 2011 Accrued Salaries specifically. The contemporaneous documents suggest that the accrued salaries could be paid from surplus cash and there was nothing to suggest that such surplus cash could not include the loan proceeds.
(iv)       While the April 2012 Agreement for the repayment of outstanding sums to the First Appellant’s shareholders did apply to shareholder loans as well as to accrued salaries, Tembusu’s reliance on this fact to suggest that the 2012 CLA prohibited the use of the loan proceeds for either of these purposes simply does not follow. At the time of the 2012 CLA, there was no agreement on conversion to equity for the shareholder loans. Nor is the fact that such an agreement was reached in April 2012 determinative of (a) whether the Appellants could use the loan proceeds to pay the accrued salaries; or (b) whether they in fact believed they could not do so at the time the Second Statement was made. On the contrary we are satisfied that they reasonably believed they could and this precludes any finding of a fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Judge’s finding on this issue must therefore be reversed.
Term restricting the use of proceeds in the 2012 CLA
69     We turn to consider whether there was an express or, alternatively, an implied term restricting the use of the 2012 CLA loan proceeds to the Four Categories.
Express Term
70     A preliminary question is whether Tembusu is able to canvass the argument that there was an express term which restricted the use of proceeds. As noted above at [36], the Judge had specifically considered this issue and concluded that no such express term existed in the 2012 CLA. Although Tembusu did not file a cross-appeal to contest this finding of the Judge, it argues that O 59 r 9A(5) of the Rules of Court allows it to raise this issue in the present appeal. Pursuant to O 59 r 9A(5), a Respondent may contend on appeal that “the decision of [the lower Court] should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that Court.” The question then arises whether Tembusu is indeed seeking to vary or affirm a “decision” of the Judge.
71     The ambit of O 59 r 9A(5) was considered in 
Peter Lim
 where we interpreted the word “decision” to refer a finding of law or fact. In 
Peter Lim
, a case which concerned defamation, the judge at first instance made three findings which resulted in the appellant’s claim being dismissed at trial: (a) the relevant extracts in question were defamatory of the appellant; (b) they were published on an occasion of qualified privilege; and (c) the appellant had failed to prove that the respondents were actuated by malice and therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeded. On appeal, the respondents sought to rely on O 59 r 9A(5) to argue that the judge should have found that the extracts were not defamatory to begin with – the respondents took the position that such reliance was justified because they were seeking to affirm the “decision” of the judge to dismiss the appellant’s claim. We rejected the respondents’ argument and held that each of the three findings referred to above constituted a distinct “decision” of the judge (
Peter Lim
 at [27]). The dismissal of the appellant’s claim was not a separate and independent decision; it was merely a consequence of the judge’s finding that there was no malice which meant that the defence of qualified privilege succeeded. Accordingly, it could not be said that that the respondents were seeking to vary or affirm any of the judge’s three “decisions”. Instead, the respondents were in effect trying to reverse decision (a) of the judge (
ie
, that the extracts were defamatory). This was held (
Peter Lim
 at [28]) to be impermissible under O 59 r 9A(5).
72     In short, the word “decision” in O 59 r 9A(5) refers not to the judge’s final determination of the claim as a whole but to each of the discrete findings which supports his overall determination. We reconsidered the operation of O 59 r 9A(5) in our subsequent decision in 
Chiam Heng Hsien
 and at [100] affirmed the observations we had earlier made in 
Peter Lim
.
73     On that basis, Tembusu is not entitled to pursue the argument that there had been an express term in the 2012 CLA restricting the use of proceeds. It is effectively seeking to reverse the Judge’s decision on this issue and should have filed a cross-appeal if it wished to do so.
74     In any event, in our judgment, there is no merit to the argument that there was such an express term in the 2012 CLA. Tembusu argues that from the UOP, a specific express term can be found, which was to the effect that the use of proceeds would be restricted to the Four Categories, and if ACTAtek wished to apply the proceeds to any other purpose, prior authorisation would have to be obtained from Tembusu. In our judgment, the fact that the UOP was annexed to the 2012 CLA does not have the effect of creating an express term with the meaning and effect that was urged upon us by the Respondent. This is so for several reasons.
75     First, there is nothing in the way of 
any
 written communications by which Tembusu had informed ACTAtek or its representatives that the use of proceeds was to be restricted to the Four Categories. This simple fact was neither refuted nor contradicted by Tembusu before us.
76     Second, the way in which the alleged express term was supposed to operate was shrouded with uncertainty. This militates against finding that the parties had intended that the UOP gave rise to an express obligation. For example, if ACTAtek was to spend more than the stipulated amount under the category of “working capital”, would that amount to a breach of such an express term even if it was compensated by a reduction of the amount indicated for some other purpose? Counsel for Tembusu, Mr Daniel Chia, argued that this would not be a breach of the express term because the values that were identified under each category were meant to be flexible and the UOP only obligated ACTAtek to spend the loan proceeds within the Four Categories. We could not see anything in the UOP that would sustain such a creative and flexible interpretation. Certainly none of this was ever discussed between the parties.
77     Given that Tembusu’s primary case was that the UOP gave rise to the express term, it would have meant, on the face of the UOP, that both the 
categories and the values
 stated would be subject to the obligatory limits stated therein. This, however, was not tenable, as was demonstrated when we queried Mr Chia as to whether it would be a breach if all of the loan proceeds were spent on “working capital” and none on the other three categories (
ie
, “sales &marketing expenses”, “R&D expenditure” and “IPO”). In such a scenario, ACTAtek would not have applied any of the proceeds outside of the Four Categories. Mr Chia initially thought the fact that all the proceeds were applied within one or some of the Four Categories would be critical. But we pointed out that on this basis, it would mean that there would have been no breach of the term he was contending for even if 
none of the proceeds
 were spent towards the listing of ACTAtek. Mr Chia accepted the difficulty in this construction and did not belabour the point.
78     It should also be noted that these were not purely theoretical concerns. As a matter of fact, part of the loan proceeds had been used to pay off a loan owed by ACTAtek to DBS, another of the group’s bankers. Tembusu knew this but did not regard it as a breach of the asserted express term despite the fact that such repayment did not fall within any of the Four Categories, (at least based on Tembusu’s interpretation of the UOP). Faced with this, Tembusu argued that there was no breach because prior approval had been sought and given for the repayment of the DBS loan. However, it could not point to any request made by ACTAtek for such permission; nor could it identify any corresponding approval which it had allegedly given. It was only able to direct us to an 
internal email
 in which Renhui had stated the following: “
[w]e expect the Company to use our new capital to repay the trade payables, and continue to repay the DBS Bridge loan monthly instalments
”. However, all this does is to demonstrate Tembusu’s awareness of certain facts and its assumption as to what the Appellants were likely to do. It was simply not evidence that such approval had been sought by or communicated to ACTAtek.
79     Our third reason for concluding that the UOP was not intended to create an express term is the seemingly inconsequential manner in which the parties treated it. As noted above at [21], the summation of the values in each of the Four Categories amounted to a figure greater than S$1.5m. When the UOP with this miscalculation was sent to Tembusu, it paid no regard to this and proceeded to disburse the loan proceeds anyway. One would have thought that if the UOP was meant to be a document that created strict obligations for the parties, greater care and scrutiny would have been applied to ensure it was a workable document in keeping with the parties’ intent.
80     Fourth, reference to the 2007 CLA reveals a further flaw in the Respondent’s case. Clause 3 of the 2007 CLA provides as follows:
The use of the Convertible Loan shall be in accordance with Schedule 3 only. Any other use(s) of the Convertible Loan shall require the prior written approval of the Lender.
The presence of this clause in the 2007 CLA and its corresponding absence in the 2012 CLA is significant. It demonstrates that when the parties intended to have an express restriction on the use of proceeds, they knew perfectly well how to reflect this in this agreement. Both parties were represented by lawyers when drafting both the 2007 and 2012 CLAs and they could easily have inserted a clause in similar terms to cl 3 of the 2007 CLA into the 2012 CLA had that been their intention. While this is not conclusive, the lack of any plausible explanation or for the difference is notable. When we queried Mr Chia on this, his only response was that the arrangement was understood between the parties in the way he was contending it should be but there was no evidence of any such understanding.
81     Finally, we consider Tembusu’s reliance on 
Sheng Siong Supermarkets Pte Ltd v Carilla Pte Ltd
 
[2011] 4 SLR 1094
 (“
Sheng Siong
”). In 
Sheng Siong
, the plaintiff entered into negotiations to establish a supermarket and a food court in a building owned by the defendant. The parties eventually signed a main term sheet (“the MTS”) which stated in cl 10 that “Tenant usage comprises supermarket, wet market, thematic F&B, offices and others”. The MTS was supposed to be incorporated into the standard tenancy agreement to form the final tenancy agreement. However, cl 10 of the MTS was omitted from the final version of the standard tenancy agreement. Nevertheless, Annex 1 of the standard tenancy agreement included a plan of the premises which depicted a supermarket. Andrew Ang J held that the plan of the premises in Annex 1 constituted an express provision which made the agreement conditional on permission being granted for the premises concerned to be used as a supermarket. Tembusu contends that the present case is on all fours with 
Sheng Siong
 and on this basis submits that the UOP should be interpreted as if it gives rise to an express obligation constraining the Appellants’ ability to apply the proceeds of the 2012 CLA.
82     In our judgment, Tembusu’s reliance on 
Sheng Siong
 is misplaced as there are marked distinctions between that case and this one. In 
Sheng Siong
, Ang J had noted (at [43]–[49]) that correspondence exchanged between the parties had expressly stated that if approval was not obtained from the relevant authorities for the plaintiff to establish its supermarket and food court operations on the premises in question, it would no longer rent the premises. Such communications are wholly absent in this case as noted at [75] above. Further, in 
Sheng Siong
 (at [61]), the only conceivable purpose of annexing the plans of the premises was to reflect “what they were envisioned to look like after the requisite A&A works had been done to convert them into premises capable of being to be used as a supermarket”. This supported Ang J’s conclusion that the attachment of the plan did reflect an express term of the contract. In the present case, as noted by the Judge (at [75] of the GD), the UOP served as the Appellants’ act of compliance with the condition precedent to Tembusu’s obligation to disburse the loan proceeds under clause 3.1(d)(ii) (see [19(b)] above). The attachment of the UOP to the agreement merely served to record the fact that in accordance with the condition precedent, the Appellants had intimated their intended application of the proceeds. But the Appellants’ 
intention
 to apply the proceeds in this way cannot, without more, become an 
obligation
 that constrains the Appellants’ ability to use it for some other purpose. We therefore do not consider that 
Sheng Siong
 aids the Respondent.
83     Hence, we agree with the Judge that the UOP did not amount to an express term restricting the use of the loan proceeds.
Implied Term
84     We turn to consider whether there was an implied term to similar effect in the 2012 CLA.
85     In 
Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal
 
[2013] 4 SLR 193
 (“
Sembcorp Marine
”), we held that for a term to be implied, a three-step process must be fulfilled (at [101]):
(a)     The first step is to ascertain whether there is a gap in the contract and if so, how it arose. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap (“the First Step”).
(b)     The court then considers whether it is it is 
necessary
 in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy (“the Second Step”).
(c)     Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract (“the Third Step”).
(1)   The First Step
86     As to the First Step, it bears emphasis that not all gaps in a contract are “true” gaps in the sense that they can be remedied by the implication of a term. It is only where the parties 
did not contemplate the issue at all, and so left a gap
, that it would be appropriate for the court to even consider implying a term into the parties’ contract (
Sembcorp Marine
 at [94]–[95]).
87     The Judge found that the gap had arisen because the parties “never contemplated the possibility that [ACTAtek] would not comply with the UOP” (the GD at [80]). This finding led the Judge to conclude that there was a gap which could be remedied by an implied term. In our judgment, this was an erroneous application of the First Step. For one thing, it assumes that the parties assumed that the UOP would not be deviated from and so never thought that they needed to make such provision. This reasoning seems to us to be faulty for at least three reasons. First, agreements are drafted from the premise of what the parties wish to secure rather than from the premise of subjectively assessing what the other party is or is not likely to act in a certain way. Second, this also seems to run contrary to the fact that the parties made no express provision restricting the use of the proceeds, a finding that the Judge also made. In this light, it seems unclear why the parties would have assumed that the Appellants would not deviate from a course that they were not expressly obliged to pursue in the first place. Finally, they had in fact already made such a provision in the 2007 CLA; this tends to militate against the premise of the Judge’s reasoning on this.
88     More fundamentally, in order to answer the question whether the parties had contemplated the particular issue or had left a gap because they missed the point altogether, the court must first consider what the alleged gap is. In the present case, the gap may be characterised as the absence of an express restriction on the use of proceeds. Therefore, the question to be asked is—did the parties overlook the issue of whether to place a restriction on the use of proceeds? It is only if this is answered in the affirmative that that there can be said to be a “true” gap which might then, in appropriate circumstances, be plugged by the implication of a term. On the present facts, it is undisputed between the parties that restrictions on the use of proceeds had indeed been 
in their contemplation
 although, as elaborated above (at [65]), the evidence shows that there was no common understanding or agreement as to the ambit of this restriction. The fact that they never reached an agreement was not because they overlooked the issue but rather because they did not come to an agreement for whatever reason. This is precisely the sort of situation where it would be inappropriate for the court to complete the task which the parties had commenced but could not conclude.
89     This is sufficient for us to reverse the Judge’s decision that a term could be implied; we nevertheless consider whether the Second Step was fulfilled.
(2)   The Second Step
90     In 
Sembcorp Marine
, we summarised how the business efficacy and officious bystander tests are meant to operate. There is no need to repeat that analysis here save to highlight a few salient points. First, the business efficacy and officious bystander tests are meant to be used complementarily and in conjunction with each other. Second, in a commercial arrangement, the basis on which the court will determine whether a term must be implied is the need to give the contract business efficacy. Third, and most significantly, the threshold for implying a term is a high one—the term will only be implied if it is 
necessary
 (
Sembcorp Marine
 at [98]–[99]).
91     In the recent decision of the UK Supreme Court in 
Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd and another
 
[2015] 3 WLR 1843
 (“
Marks and Spencer
”), Lord Neuberger observed (at [21]) that “necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment” and that the test is not one of “absolute necessity”. Rather, a term will be implied if “without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence”.
92     In the present case, the Judge found that it was necessary in the business sense to imply the term into the 2012 CLA on the basis that it would provide greater commercial justification to the conditions precedent (
ie
, cl 3 of the 2012 CLA). Specifically, he said at [81]:
81    … it makes no commercial or business sense for a loan agreement to require a borrower, as a condition precedent to the lender’s obligation to lend, to draw up a list detailing how it intends to use the money being lent but not to bind the borrower in any way to complying with it.
93     In our judgment, this analysis was erroneous. The correct question to be asked is whether 
the contract or agreement
 would lack commercial or practical coherence if a term was not implied and not whether a particular express 
term
 in the contract would be accorded greater commercial sense with the implication of the term.
94     The short point is that with the benefit of hindsight there will often be room to think one can improve a contract. That, however, is emphatically not the test for implication. There is simply no reason to think that the 2012 CLA would lose commercial or practical coherence if such a restriction on the use of proceeds were not included. At its core, the 2012 CLA effectively remained a loan agreement. The primary business consideration which undergirded the loan agreement, from Tembusu’s perspective, was the generation of returns on the loan. From the structure of the 2012 CLA, it is evident that even if ACTAtek had failed to list, Tembusu would nonetheless have been able to generate returns. Pursuant to cl 5 of the 2012 CLA, if ACTAtek failed to complete an IPO before 30 June 2013, Tembusu would have the option to convert the loan into fully-paid shares of ACTAtek at a 50% discount to the price of each share which was to be ascertained pursuant to an independent valuation. Additionally, cl 3.1(f) of the 2012 CLA, read with the Variation agreement, also had the effect of amending the maturity date contained in the 2007 CLA to 31 December 2013 (see above at [19(c)]). Therefore, under the 2012 CLA, regardless of whether the ACTAtek did successfully list, Tembusu would have been able to derive positive returns on its investments made in 2007 and 2012 and this would have remained so even if there were no restriction on the use of proceeds.
95     In this regard, the observations of Lord Neuberger in 
Marks and Spencer
 are apposite:
21    … a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term.
96     To say that a term should be implied in this case would require us to rewrite the 2012 CLA in terms which we might consider to be reasonable or better. But, we reiterate, that is not the appropriate approach to be taken to implying a term and, in our judgment, the high threshold of necessity was not met in the present case.
97     We therefore reverse the Judge’s finding that there was an implied term in the 2012 CLA restricting the use of proceeds on this ground also.
Breach of term restricting use of proceeds
98     It follows from this that ACTAtek did not breach the 2012 CLA by using the loan proceeds to pay off the 2011 Accrued Salaries. We would add, however, that even if there had been a term restricting the use of proceeds to the Four Categories, this term would probably not have been breached given our earlier observation that the payment of such salaries would likely have fallen within the ambit of “working capital” (see above at [61]).
99     Tembusu was therefore not entitled to call an event of default under the 2012 CLA or the 2007 CLA. We therefore set aside the judgment of the court below.
The Appellants’ counterclaim
100    This requires us to consider the counterclaim for damages advanced by the Appellants. As noted above (at [33]), the Appellants’ counterclaim rests on four legs. We first consider whether Tembusu committed a repudiatory breach of the 2012 CLA by wrongfully calling an event of default.
Repudiatory breach of the 2012 CLA
101    Tembusu argues that even if it had wrongly declared an event of default, this did not amount to a repudiatory breach of the 2012 CLA. Rather, the consequence of a wrongful calling of an event of default was simply that the notice asserting such event of default would be considered invalid. In this respect, Tembusu relies heavily on the decision of the House of Lords in 
Concord Trust v The Law Debenture Trust Corporation
 
[2005] 1 WLR 1591
 (“
Concord Trust
”) and the decision of the English Court of Appeal in 
Jafari-Fini v Skillglass Ltd and others
 [2007] EWCA Civ 261 (“
Jafari-Fini
”). It is therefore necessary for us to consider these cases carefully.
(1)    
Concord Trust
 
102    In 
Concord Trust
, certain bonds were issued by a finance company. The terms of the bond were set out in a trust deed between the finance company and the trustee. Under those terms, where requested by bondholders of at least 30% of the principal amount outstanding of the bonds, the trustee would be obliged (subject to it being indemnified to its satisfaction) to give notice to the finance company that the bonds are immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default. Subsequently, the bondholders’ nominated board member was removed and this led to a committee of bondholders, representing 40% of value, contending that an event of default had occurred and they directed the trustee to give notice of this to the finance company. The trustee was informed by the finance company that it disputed the event of default and that an invalid notice of acceleration would cause it substantial losses by the effect it would have on third parties with whom they had, or might have, dealings. This led the trustee to seek an indemnity of up to €1b from the bondholders. Dissatisfied with this, the bondholders commenced proceedings against the trustee seeking a declaration that the trustee was required to issue a notice of default to the finance company. The House of Lords had to consider whether the trustee was entitled to insist on an indemnity to cover its possible exposure to an action by the finance company for damages if the event of default was found to have been called incorrectly.
103    The House of Lords held that the trustee could not reasonably insist on an indemnity to cover the risk of possible liability to the finance company unless the risk was more than a merely fanciful one. Four possible causes of action were identified by the trustee in the event the default was found to have been called incorrectly: (a) breach of an express or implied term of the contract; (b) breach of a tortious duty of care; (c) conspiring with the bondholders to cause the finance company injury by unlawful means; and (d) interfering by unlawful means with the finance company’s business. The identified causes of action in 
Concord Trust
 are similar to those pursued by the Appellants in their counterclaim.
104    The House of Lords found that there was no express or implied term in the trust deed which would be breached if the trustee made an unjustified assertion of an event of default. Lord Scott of Foscote, in delivering the judgment of the court, made the following observations:
36     
Breach of contract.
 The act that would have to constitute the breach of contract is the giving of an invalid notice of acceleration, or, perhaps, having regard to the claims apparently made in arbitration, the unjustified assertion of the occurrence of an event of default. There is nowhere in the trust deed any express undertaking by the trustee not to do either of those things. So a suitable term would have to be read into the trust deed.
37    Various tests for the implication of terms into a contract have been formulated in various well known cases. In particular, a term will be implied if it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract: 
The Moorcock
 (1889) 14 PD 64, 68. The proposed implied term cannot satisfy this test. The trustee deed works perfectly well without the implied term. It is open to [the finance company] to challenge the existence of an alleged event of default or the validity of a notice of acceleration. If the challenge succeeds neither the alleged event nor the invalid notice will be of any contractual significance. … The implied term is not necessary to give business efficacy to the trust deed. Nor are any of the other tests that have from time to time been formulated for the implication of terms into a contract any more apt. In my opinion, it is not reasonably arguable that the unjustified assertion by the trustee of an event of default or the giving by the trustee of an invalid notice of acceleration exposes the trustee to the risk of being found liable in damages for breach of contract.
(2)    
Jafari-Fini
 
105     
Concord Trust
 was applied in the subsequent English Court of Appeal decision of 
Jafari-Fini
. There, the claimant alleged that the defendant had committed a repudiatory breach of the facility agreement by wrongfully calling an event of default. The claimant’s arguments were rejected by the Court of Appeal with heavy reliance placed on the authority of 
Concord Trust
 (per Lord Justice Moore-Bick):
 
(ii) The effect of an unauthorised notice of default
 
112    … It was Mr Jafari-Fini’s case that in those circumstances by serving the October notice Skillglass repudiated the Facility Agreement, thereby discharging PAL from all liability under it and him from any liability under his guarantee.
113    This submission raises the question whether on the true construction of the agreement the service of an unauthorized notice of default would constitute a breach of contract at all. Most commercial loan agreements under which the principal is repayable by instalments contain a provision of some kind permitting the lender to accelerate the debt in the event of a default by declaring the whole of the outstanding amount repayable on demand. However, they do not normally contain either an express or implied obligation on the lender to refrain from giving a notice of default that is premature or invalid for some other reason. If a notice of default is given before one of the stipulated events has occurred the notice is simply invalid and of no effect: see 
Concord Trust v The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc
 …
114    The judge held that there was nothing to distinguish the Facility Agreement from the terms of the bonds considered in the 
Concord Trust
 case and that therefore Skillglass did not in any event commit a beach of the agreement by giving the October notice and making the December demand. Mr Beazley submitted, however, that the judge was wrong so to hold because the expression “… the Lender shall not be permitted to …” in the proviso to cl 23.2 imposed a positive obligation on Skillglass not to give notice of default until the expiry of the Certain Funds Period unless there was a continuing Major Default.
115    I am unable to accept that submission. I recognize, of course, that each agreement must be construed in accordance with its own terms, but the principles identified by Jonathan Parker LJ in the 
Concord Trust
 case apply generally to instruments of this kind. They provide a degree of certainty and a clear point on departure for those embarking on transactions of this type. The parties are free to depart from that position, if they wish to do so, but if that is their intention they can be expected to make it clear. In my view neither the language of the proviso nor any wider commercial considerations support Mr Beazley’s argument. … The argument can only succeed, therefore, if the agreement imposes on Skillglass an implied obligation to refrain from giving notice of default when no event of default has occurred, a proposition which I am unable to accept in the light of the decision in the 
Concord Trust
 case.
106    The Appellants submit that there is a key distinction between the factual matrices that were presented in 
Concord Trust
 and 
Jafari-Fini
, and in the present case. In the former cases, the lenders did not have any continuing obligations under the contract—they had already provided the loan and therefore the wrongful calling of an event of default could not amount to a breach of the contract. The Appellants argue, however, that in the present case, Tembusu’s obligations under the 2012 CLA had not yet ceased. They rely on cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA which provides that in the event that ACTAtek completes an IPO or RTO before 30 June 2013, Tembusu “shall, immediately prior to the completion of the IPO or RTO, unconditionally convert the Loan into fully-paid shares … of [ACTAtek] at a fifty per cent. (50%) discount to the Issue Price”. According to the Appellants, by calling the event of default wrongfully and asking for the loan amounts to be repaid immediately, Tembusu had evinced an intention not to comply with this continuing obligation under the 2012 CLA. The Appellants therefore seek to rely on an 
anticipatory repudiatory breach
 of the 2012 CLA.
107    In our judgment, assuming, without deciding, that 
Concord Trust
 and 
Jafari-Fini
 were correctly decided, a point to which we shall return shortly, the fact that there was nothing left to be performed by the party that was purportedly acting wrongfully in those cases is a significant distinguishing factor. Unlike those cases, the lender’s (
ie
, Tembusu’s) obligation under the 2012 CLA did not cease with its disbursements of the loan proceeds. Pursuant to cl 5.1 of 2012 CLA, Tembusu was still under the 
express
 continuing obligation to convert the loan into equity upon the successful IPO. In this regard, the 2012 CLA was an executory contract and differs from 
Concord Trust
 and 
Jafari-Fini
 in which, by the time the event of default was purportedly declared, the contracts had already been wholly executed on the part of the lenders.
108    In Edwin Peel, “No liability for service of an invalid notice of ‘event of default’” (2006) 122(Apr) LQR 179 (“Edwin Peel”), the learned author notes (at p 182) that in 
Concord Trust
, the bondholders were not relying upon the event of default “to withhold performance of any of its obligations” and that the outcome would be different if in calling the event of default, there was 
non-performance
 in the form, for example, of the lender refusing payment of an instalment which is due or if security was enforced pursuant to what turned out to be an invalid notice (see Edwin Peel at pp 182–183 and 
Concord Trust
 at [41]–[42]). The significant question is therefore whether the wrongful calling of an event of default is accompanied by an element of non-performance.
109    Similarly, in Qiao Liu, “Inferring Future Breach: Towards a Unifying Test of Anticipatory Breach of Contract” (2007) 66 Cambridge LJ 574, the learned author explains that there was no anticipatory breach in 
Concord Trust
 (at pp 588–589) because the manifestation of an intention not to be bound by the contract in that case did not entail future non-performance of the contract.
110    We are satisfied that a key premise undergirding the decisions in 
Concord Trust
 and 
Jafari-Fini
 was that there was no element of non-performance or future non-performance of the contracts when the event of default was wrongfully declared and in that sense, it could not be said that the lender was repudiating the contract simply because there was no obligation under the contract to be repudiated. Because of that, to find a breach of contract, it seems to have been thought that it had to be established that there was either an express or implied term 
not
 to wrongfully call an event of default. We are not faced with the same constraints on our facts since the wrongful declaration of the event of default was accompanied by Tembusu’s manifestation of its refusal to comply with cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. In our judgment, this suffices to constitute an anticipatory breach of the 2012 CLA.
111    Having therefore found that Tembusu had breached the 2012 CLA, it is not necessary for us to consider the other heads of counterclaim relied upon by the Appellants.
112    We pause to make one observation picking up on the reservation we made at [107]. In both 
Concord Trust
 and 
Jafari-Fini
, the courts proceeded on the basis that it was not a breach for a lender to accelerate the repayment of a loan contrary to the agreed terms for repayment or to assert an event of default without basis. It has not been necessary for us to reach a conclusion on this because, as we have noted, it is possible to distinguish the present case from both those cases. We therefore leave open for decision on another occasion whether such conduct if wrongly done would amount to a breach of the implicit obligation to act in accordance with explicit obligations that have been undertaken in the contract.
The claimable losses
113    All that remains to be ascertained is the losses which flowed from Tembusu’s breach. Since full arguments have not been canvassed before us on this point, we remit the matter back to the trial Judge for an assessment of damages. For the avoidance of doubt, we should state that our judgment does not preclude points being taken as to the causation or quantification of the losses and damages flowing from Tembusu’s breach.
114    For example, we note that in relation to the major head of damage being claimed for by the Appellants, 
ie
, the loss of capitalisation of ACTAtek shares which would have accrued to them upon the successful IPO, Tembusu objects to this head of claim based on the listing structure of ACTAtek which was to proceed in the following steps:
(a)     First, a company with no assets and liabilities would be incorporated in NZ by IRG and named ACTAtek Limited (“ACTNZ”). This step was completed by the Appellants.
(b)     Second, ACTAtek would then sell all its subsidiaries (
ie
, the ACTAtek Group) to ACTNZ which was valued by Thomas at NZ$30,548,000.
(c)     Third, ACTNZ would pay for these subsidiaries by issuing 121,400,000 shares to the Appellants.
(d)     Fourth, ACTNZ (now with putative assets of NZ$30,548,000) would then be listed on the NZ stock exchange.
Tembusu contends that, based on the above, although the listing did not materialise, the Appellants still retain the benefit and value of ACTAtek’s business. Therefore, Tembusu maintains that the Appellants had in fact suffered no loss in relation to the failure to list or at least not the entire loss of the anticipated capitalisation.
115    Whether or not there is legitimacy in this is a matter for the assessment at which the parties will have to persuade the Judge on matters of causation and quantification so that he may assess precisely the losses which flowed from Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA.
Conclusion
116    In summary, we allow the appeal in CA 191/2014. With respect to the main claim, we overturn the Judge’s findings that the Appellants were liable in the tort of deceit and that the Appellants had breached an implied term of the 2012 CLA. As for the counterclaim, we find that the wrongful declaration of the event of default did amount to a breach of the 2012 CLA. The matter is remitted to the Judge for an assessment of damages.
117    The Appellants are to have their costs here and below which are to be taxed if not agreed. We also make the usual consequential order for the security to be released to the Appellants.",2016-08-17 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Newspaper publication imputing conduct unethical and unbecoming an advocate and solicitor
 
The plaintiff in this case claims damages against the defendants for a libel contained in a report headed `Woman claims T Blangah election was rigged` and published by the defendants in the issue of The
 Straits Times 
 newspaper of 22 January 1981.
The facts are these. The plaintiff is and was at all material times an advocate and solicitor practising under the style of Murugason & Co in Singapore. The defendants are the proprietors and publishers of The
 Straits Times 
, a newspaper with a wide circulation in Singapore and is one of two English language newspapers delivered in the morning in Singapore. In the 1980 General Election the Telok Blangah constituency was contested by Rohan bin Kamis of the People`s Action Party and by JB Jeraretnam of the Workers` Party. Rohan bin Kamis was elected. On 17 January 1981, an election petition (Election Petition No 1/81) was presented to the High Court on behalf of Mdm Chiew Kim Keat by Murugason & Co in which she stated that she was not satisfied with the election of Rohan bin Kamis on the grounds that there were certain irregularities at a polling centre and at the polling stations in her constituency Telok Blangah and prayed that it might be determined that Rohan bin Kamis was not duly elected or returned and that the election was void. On 22 January 1981, the defendants published in 
 The Straits Times 
 the following report:
 Woman claims T Blangah election was rigged 
 
A Telok Blangah voter has filed a petition in the High Court alleging that the election of Rohan Kamis last 23 December as PAP MP for that constituency was rigged.
 
 
 
This voter identifies herself as Mdm Chiew Kim Keat of Depot Road in the petition, which was filed by her lawyer, Mr R Murugason, on Saturday at noon. She paid in cash the $2,000 deposit as required by election law. She is asking the court to declare as void the election, in which Mr JB Jeyaretnam of the Workers` Party lost by 1,046 votes. She cites a number of grounds, one of which relates to an incident over the collection of ballot boxes at the Kampong Jagoh Primary School polling station.
In that incident, a bus despatched to collect the six ballot boxes from the school for a counting centre took off with only five of them on board, and only returned later for the remaining one.
 `Substituted` 
 
Mdm Chiew claims the bus came back only after 20 minutes and says she `has reason to believe` that during the time lapse, either the box left behind or one of the other five was substituted with another box containing ballot papers marked for Mr Rohan but not cast for him by voters. Alternatively, she claims in her petition, ballot papers marked for Mr Rohan were inserted into one or more boxes. She does not say who was responsible for the alleged rigging; nor does she name anyone as respondent to the petition.
 
 
 
Other grounds cited by her are: 
 
THAT presiding officers at some booths marked ballot papers for some voters even when those voters were capable of doing this themselves.
 
 
 
THAT a voter on the register was `refused permission` to vote, and
 
 
 
THAT, one voter was allowed to vote twice. Mdm Chiew was said to be not at home when two 
 Straits Times
 reporters and a photographer called at the Depot Road address listed in her petition last night at 10 o`clock. The people answering the door acknowledged that they were her relatives and declined to answer questions.
 
 
 
 
 
 Own accord 
 
 
 
 
 
When pressed, one of them a woman in her late 40s, told the 
 Straits Times
 reporters to `use their heads` to decide if Mdm Chiew had acted on her own accord.
 
 
 
The best person to answer questions was either Mr Jeyaretnam or Mr Murugason, she said, and added: 
 
`After all, she is only a washerwoman and they are lawyers.`
 
 
 
Mr Murugason, a WP candidate who lost in Jalan Kayu in the December general election, confirmed that he was acting for Mdm Chiew but declined to discuss the petition. Under election law, a person who has filed such a petition and paid the deposit to the Returning Officer is required to name the respondent upon whom the petition is to be served.
 
 
 
Once the respondent is served with the petition, the court will fix a date for hearing.
The words in the report which the plaintiff complained of as defamatory are in the paragraphs headed `Own accord`.
In para 4 of the amended statement of claim it is pleaded: 
 
4 By the said words the Defendant meant and was understood to mean that the Plaintiff had acted improperly and or unethically in the conduct of his practice and an Advocate and Solicitor of this court.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Particulars of what the words meant and were understood to mean 
 
 
 
(i) Mdm Chiew Kim Keat had not instructed the Plaintiff`s firm to present the petition. 
 
(ii) The Plaintiff had presented or caused to be presented the petition to the court without getting proper instructions to do so from the Petitioner and was acting for her as her Solicitor. 
 
(iii) Such conduct was improper unethical and unbecoming an Advocate and Solicitor of this Honourable Court. 
 
 
 
 Facts and matters on which the Plaintiff relies in respect of such meaning 
 
 
 
(1) The Plaintiff repeats para 1 of the Statement of Statement of Claim herein. 
 
(2) The Plaintiff is required in the practice of his profession as an Advocate and Solicitor to have a brief from any client before instituting any proceedings or acting in any way whatsoever on behalf of the client. 
 
(3) The Plaintiff was not a voter in the election in respect of which the Election Petition was presented.
  
 
 
The action of the plaintiff is based entirely upon the innuendo pleaded in para 4 of the amended statement of claim supported by particulars under O 78 R 3(1). This rule provides that the plaintiff must give particulars of the extrinsic facts relied on as importing the additional (or altered) meaning and the existence of such facts is essential to the cause of action. Para 4 complains that by innuendo, those words are defamatory. They are alleged to be understood to mean that the plaintiff had acted improperly and or unethically as a solicitor. It is not alleged that the words are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning.
The principles applicable here are to be found in (1) Gatley on

In 
 Hough 
 
 v 
 
 London Express Newspaper Ltd 
 [1940] 507, 513, 515 Slesser LJ said: 
 
The burden on the plaintiff is to give evidence of special circumstances which would lead reasonable persons to infer that the words were understood in a defamatory meaning provided such circumstances were known to those persons to whom the words were published: 
 Capital and Counties Bank
 
 v
 
 Henty
. The evidence required is evidence of special facts causing the words to have a meaning revealed to those who knew the special facts but not revealed by the words in the absence of such knowledge: 
 Tolley
 
 v
 
 JS Fry & Sons, Ltd
: but as Greer LJ points out in the same case in the Court of Appeal: `It is not proof of a special fact in this sense merely to call a number of people to say that they understood the words in a defamatory sense; they would have to prove some fact known to them which would be sufficient to entitle any reasonable man with such knowledge to interpret the words in a defamatory sense.
 
 
 
And Goddard LJ said: 
 
The question of law that arises in this case may thus be stated. Where words are not defamatory in their ordinary meaning, but by reason of special facts are capable of being understood in a secondary and defamatory sense by persons to whom the special facts are known, is it necessary to prove more than that there are people who know the special facts and so might understand the words in a defamatory sense or must there be evidence that some person did so understand them? In my opinion it is unnecessary, though I do not say inadmissible, to call persons to say that they did so understand the words, provided it is proved that they are people who might so understand them.
 
 
 
In 
 Grubb 
 
 v 
 
 Bristol United Press Ltd 
 
[1963] 1 QB 309
, 328 Holroyd Pearce LJ said: 
 
But the genuine innuendo which provides a separate cause of action is that which alleges an extension of the meaning of the words used and it must be supported by evidence of facts extrinsic to the words themselves...
 
 
 
Although it is not done in practice, I see nothing to prevent the plaintiff, if he chooses, from pleading what he contends to be the ordinary meaning of the words, either in a case where it is doubtful whether a defamatory inference is within the ordinary meaning or even where the words are plainly defamatory. He would merely be providing the defendant with the nature of his case on that point. But, since the practice is to regard a plea beginning `By the said words the defendant meant and was understood to mean` as connoting a plea of innuendo from extrinsic facts, the plaintiff, unless he added the words `in their natural and ordinary meaning` to show that he was not pleading an innuendo proper, would no doubt be ordered to give particulars under O 19 r 6(2). If, even at that stage, the plaintiff made it clear that he was alleging no extension of meaning but only the ordinary meaning, the order would not apply and the plea would not be struck out for lack of particulars.
The plaintiff in the present case, however, did not do that, but delivered particulars, and contends that he is entitled under those particulars to allege an extended meaning.
In 
 Lewis 
 
 v 
 
 Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 
[1964] AC 234
, 273, 279 Lord Hodson and Lord Devlin expressed views as to the pleading and nature of innuendoes.
Lord Hodson said: 
 
I argue with the observations of Upjohn LJ in 
 Grubb
 
 v
 
 Bristol United Press Ltd
 to the effect that O 19 r 6(2), makes no alteration in the law except in cases where a true innuendo is pleaded. A pleader is entitled to allege in his statement of claim what the words in their natural and ordinary meaning convey, provided he makes it clear that he is not relying upon a true innuendo which gives a separate cause of action and requires a separate verdict from the jury.
 
 
 
Lord Devlin said: 
 
My Lords, a system of pleading was built up on this basis which in 1949 was disconcerted by the introduction of a new rule - O 19 r 6(2). The object of the rule was to require that extrinsic facts must not only be proved but pleaded, thus restoring the position before 1852. The object was simple enough. It is the language of the rule that has caused the difficulties which have recently been brought to a head and have been the subject of three decisions, including the present one, by the Court of Appeal. The sub-rule reads: (2) In an action for libel or slander if the plaintiff alleges that the words or matter complained of were used in a defamatory sense other than their ordinary meaning, he shall give particular of the facts and matters on which he relies in support of such sense.`
 
 
 
The word `innuendo` is not used. But the effect of the language is that any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic fact is assumed to be part of the ordinary meaning of the words. Accordingly, an innuendo, however well concealed, that is capable of being detected in the language used is deemed to be part of the ordinary meaning.
This might be an academic matter if it were not for the principle that the ordinary meaning of words and the meaning enlarged by innuendo give rise to separate causes of action. This principle, which originated out of the old forms of pleading, seems to me in modern times to be of dubious value. But it is now firmly settled on the authority of 
 Sim 
 
 v Stretch 
, and the House was not asked to qualify it. How is this principle affected by the new rule? Are there now three causes of action? If there are only two, to which of them does the innuendo that is inherent in the words belong? In 
 Grubb 
 
 v 
 
 Bristol United Press Ltd 
 the Court of Appeal, disagreeing with some observations made by Diplock LJ in 
 Loughans 
 
 v 
 
 Odhams Press Ltd 
 decided in effect that there were only two causes of action and that the innuendo cause of action comprised only the innuendo that was supported by extrinsic facts.
My Lords, I think, on the whole, that this is the better solution, though it brings with it a consequence that I dislike, namely, that at two points there is a divergence between the popular and the legal meaning of words. Just as the popular and legal meanings of `malice` have drifted apart, so the popular and legal meanings of `innuendo` must now be separated. I shall in the rest of my speech describe as a legal innuendo the innuendo that is the subject-matter of a separate cause of action. I suppose that it does not matter what terminology is used so long as it is agreed. But I do not care for the description of the popular innuendo as a false innuendo; it is the law and not popular usage that gives a false and restricted meaning to the word. The other respect is that the natural and ordinary meaning of words for the purposes of a defamation is not their natural and ordinary meaning for other purposes of the law. There must be added to the implications which a court is prepared to make as a matter of construction all such insinuations and innuendoes as could reasonably be read into them by the ordinary man.
The consequence of all this is, I think, that there will have to be three paras in a statement of claim where previously two have served. In the first paragraph the defamatory words will be set out as hitherto. It may be that they will speak for themselves. If not, a second para will set out those innuendoes or indirect meanings which go beyond the literal meaning of the words but which the pleader claims to be inherent in them. Thirdly, if the pleader has the necessary material, he can plead a secondary meaning or legal innuendo supported by particulars under O 19 r 6(2). Hitherto it has been customary to put the whole innuendo into one paragraph but now this may easily result in the confusion of two causes of action and in consequent embarrassment. The essential distinction between the second and third paragraph will lie in the fact that particulars under the rule must be appended to the third. That is, so to speak, the hallmark of the legal innuendo. The pleader can, if he chooses emphasise the character of the second para by including in it some such words as were used in 
 Loughan`s 
case. That case was, in my opinion, rightly decided and rightly distinguished from 
 Grubb`s 
 case by Upjohn LJ in the latter case. Or the pleader can, as was suggested by Holroyd Pearce LJ in 
 Grubb`s 
 case, plead in the second para that the words in their natural and ordinary meaning were understood to mean one thing; and then he could plead in the third paragraph that by reason of the facts thereinafter particularised they were understood to mean another. The meanings alleged in the third para can be the same as those alleged in the second paragraph if the pleader is relying upon the legal innuendo only as an alternative; or they can be different. But the essential thing is that if a para is unaccompanied by particulars it cannot be a legal innuendo since for a legal innuendo particulars are mandatory and the innuendo cannot be proved without them.
The plaintiff must, unless the words complained of are defamatory in their natural or ordinary meaning, plead the meaning he alleges the words to have. In 
 Fullam 
 
 v 
 
 Newcastle Chronicle 
 [1977] 3 All ER 32, 35 Lord Denning MR said: 
 
The essence of libel is the publication of written words to a person or persons by whom they would be reasonably understood to be defamatory of the plaintiff. But those words may give rise to two separate and distinct causes of action: see 
 Grubb
 
 v
 
 Bristol United Press Ltd
 and 
 Lewis
 
 v
 
 Daily Telegraph Ltd
. They are these.
 
 
 
First, the cause of action based on a popular innuendo. If the plaintiff relies on the natural meanings of the words (pleading what is called a `popular` innuendo so as to show what, in his view, is the natural and ordinary meaning) he must, in his statement of claim, specify the person or persons to whom they were published, save in the case of a newspaper or periodical which is published to the world at large, when the persons are so numerous as to go without saying - or book, I would add.
Secondly, the cause of action based on a legal innuendo. If the plaintiff relies on some special-circumstances which convey (to some particular person or persons knowing these circumstances) a special defamatory meaning other than the natural and ordinary meaning of the words (pleading what is called a `legal innuendo, so as to show what is that special defamatory meaning), then he must in his statement of claim specify the particular person or persons to whom they were published and the special circumstances known to that person or persons, for the simple reason that these are the `material facts` on which he relies, and must rely, for this cause of action. It comes straight within the general rule of pleading contained in RSC O 18 r 7; and also within the particular rule in libel actions contained in RSC O 82 r 3. In this second cause of action there is no exception in the case of a newspaper, because the words would not be so understood by the world at large, but only by the particular person or persons who know the special circumstances.
And in 
 Grappelli 
 
 v 
 
 Derek Block Holdings (S) Ltd 
 Lord Denning MR again said: 
 
In the case of these secondary meanings even innuendos, the plaintiff ought to specify the persons who have the particular knowledge from which they drew a defamatory meaning.
 
 
 
In the present case the plaintiff has not specified the persons who have the particular knowledge from which they drew a defamatory meaning. Nor are any special circumstances or meanings alleged.
I now come to deal with para 4 of the amended statement of claim where the plaintiff has pleaded some meaning.
Under facts and matters relied upon:
 
 
(1) Cannot support an innuendo as it is a statement of fact that the plaintiff is a solicitor. 
 
(2) The plaintiff must have a brief. The words in the report do not imply that he did not have instructions. 
 
(3) The plaintiff was not a voter in the Telok Blangah constituency. If anybody knew that he was not a Telok Blangah constituent (no one has been called) why should they suppose that the plaintiff had any indirect or dishonourable motive for having the election at Telok Blangah declared void?
  
 
 
Under `Particulars of what the words meant and understood to mean`:
 
 
(i) Mdm Chiew Kim Keat had not instructed the plaintiff`s firm to present the petition. This is an example of what 
 Gatley 
 at para 1076 calls an `Imaginative innuendo`. That is, putting a strained or unjustified meaning on words. To argue without evidence that the words reported in the article would be understood by a reader having some special knowledge, or because of some extrinsic facts or circumstances, as meaning that the plaintiff had acted without Mdm Chiew`s instructions, is unsustainable. 
 
(ii) What does the plaintiff mean by saying `Without getting proper instructions` when in (i) he alleged that the words meant that he had no instructions at all. It is difficult to understand. The phrase `proper instructions` is vague. The words `and was acting for her as her solicitor` do not have any clear meaning. Do they mean that the plaintiff not only filed the Petition without `proper instructions` but is also purporting to act as her solicitor without `proper` instructions. 
 
(iii) The innuendo under (iii) would likely arise only if the meaning raised under (i) as an innuendo (and under (ii) if it is not too vague) is made out.
  
 
 
The general burden of proof is on the plaintiff, so that it is for him to show, if he relies on the natural and ordinary meaning, that the words convey a defamatory imputation, or, if it is disputed what defamatory imputation they convey, that they convey the most serious imputation on which he relies (
 Gatley 
 para 114). Where in their natural and ordinary meaning the words are not defamatory of the plaintiff he will have the onus of showing that there were extrinsic facts, known to one or more of those persons to whom the words were published, which would cause the words to convey the defamatory imputation on which he relies to a reasonable person with that knowledge. He need not prove that anyone did understand the words in that sense ( 
 Gatley 
 para 116).
As I have said, the cause of action as pleaded in the amended statement of claim is one which is based solely on a legal innuendo. In it the plaintiff relies on special circumstances which convey to some particular person or persons, knowing those circumstances, a special defamatory meaning other than the natural and ordinary meaning. However, on the final address of counsel for the plaintiff, it seems that the plaintiff is also claiming a natural and ordinary meaning. That is a separate cause of action. It is clear that the plaintiffs action as pleaded is based entirely upon a legal innuendo.
On 4 October 1983, solicitors for the defendants wrote to the solicitors for the plaintiff in these terms: 
 
In para 4 of the Statement of Claim, it is not alleged specifically that the words complained of, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean what is alleged in that paragraph.
 
 
 
As it is not pleaded that those meanings are attributable to the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning, it appears that your client is relying on a legal, or true, innuendo, in which event the provisions of O 78 R 3(1) apply, but have not been complied with. We, therefore, call upon you to file particulars of the facts and matters on which your client relies in support of the alleged innuendoes.
As the trial is fixed for 7 and 8 November next, it is important that these particulars should be filed without delay.
If, on the other hand, the defamation pleaded is alleged to arise out of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and para 4, with the particulars thereunder, was only intended to plead the meanings which the Plaintiff says such words bear, would you please let us know at once, and confirm that you will apply to amend the Statement of Claim at the trial to add the words `in their natural and ordinary meaning` in line of para 4 of the Statement of Claim, after the word `Defendant`.
The Statement of Claim as it stands is confusing and we shall have to apply to court unless we hear satisfactorily from you by return.
No reply was received by the defendants` solicitors and on 11 October 1983, an application for further directions` was filed seeking an order that: 
 
Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim may be amended or struck out as tending to prejudice or embarrass the fair trial of this action and/or for irregularity for non-compliance with the Rules of the Supreme Court, O 78 r 3(1) in that it is not alleged that the words complained of in para 3 of the Statement of Claim in their natural and ordinary meaning bear the meanings alleged in para 4 of the Statement of Claim and yet no particulars of the innuendoes alleged are given as required by the said O 78 r 3(1).
 
 
 
On 7 November 1983, the plaintiff amended his statement of claim.
By relying solely on a legal innuendo, the plaintiff admits that in their natural and ordinary meaning, the words are not defamatory. No special, technical or slang meanings and no extrinsic facts and circumstances are alleged to create an innuendo.
The only evidence has been that of the plaintiff himself who testified as to what innuendo he considered the report to contain. No evidence whatever has been called to prove that there are some special meanings, facts or circumstances in this case and that there are people acquainted with them and so might understand the report in the defamatory sense alleged, and that the report was published to them. Such evidence is an essential element in a case of legal innuendo.
As the plaintiff has failed to establish any legal innuendo his claim must fail.
The plaintiff`s claim is dismissed with costs.

1          The appellant claimed trial to a charge of fabricating false evidence for use in a High Court Suit, an offence under s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to seven years.
 
2          The judge convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced her to two years’ imprisonment. The appellant initially appealed against both her conviction and sentence. Subsequently, in a letter to the Court dated 21 February 2003, she dropped the appeal against conviction and elected to proceed with the appeal against sentence only.
3          After careful consideration of the circumstances of this case, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
The  facts
4          The appellant was at the relevant time working as the secretary of one Gopalan Mukunnan (‘Mukunnan’), then the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Malta to Singapore. Sometime in early 1992, the appellant and Mukunnan came to know of a Nigerian transaction which promised a profit of US$2.7m with an investment of only a few hundred thousand dollars. Mukunnan wanted to participate in the deal but had insufficient funds.
5          Sometime around June 1993, Mukunnan approached his old friend, one John Fernando (‘Fernando’) for a loan. Fernando, after discussing the loan with his wife, Sita Fernando (‘Sita’), agreed to lend Mukunnan $50,000 for him to carry out ‘site visits’ in Nigeria. Whilst in Nigeria, Mukunnan asked for a further loan of $354,000. Fernando reluctantly agreed to the further loan.
6          On 4 November 1993, Fernando and Sita went to Mukunnan’s office to obtain from the appellant a letter of surety (with the Malta Consulate as guarantor) for the loan of $354,000, as instructed by Mukunnan. The letter of surety was typed on the Malta Consulate letterhead and signed by the appellant “for Malta Consul Singapore”. After obtaining the letter of surety, Fernando remitted $354,000 to Nigeria. Mukunnan subsequently borrowed another $6,000 from Fernando.
7          The deal turned out to be a scam. In 1998, Fernando commenced an action in the High Court (
John Fernando v Gopalan Mukunnan,
 Suit No 2360/1998) (‘High Court Suit’) against Mukunnan to recover the total loan amount of $410,000. The crux of Mukunnan’s defence was that the payments were not loans to him, but Fernando’s investments in the business venture and he was hence not liable to repay Fernando a single cent.
8          The appellant then swore an affidavit before a Commissioner for Oaths stating in paragraph 22 of that affidavit that Fernando had signed a letter (‘impugned letter’) promising that he “would not use the letter of surety dated 4 November 1993 against the Consulate of Malta for any claims purposes whatsoever”. A copy of the impugned letter was annexed to the affidavit. The appellant also stated in the affidavit that she was alone with Fernando when the impugned letter was typed and that she saw Fernando sign it.
9          The affidavit was filed in court. The High Court Suit was eventually settled with a consent judgment being entered in favour of Fernando.
10       Fernando denied signing the impugned letter and he proceeded to lodge a police report, which led to the present charge against the appellant.
The trial below
11        At the trial below, the prosecution adduced expert evidence to show that the signature on the impugned letter was a forgery and, since the appellant claimed in her affidavit that she had 
seen
 Fernando sign the impugned letter, there was no possibility that the appellant did not know that the impugned letter was a forgery. The inevitable inference was that the appellant had either forged the signature herself, or had at least been aware that the signature was a forgery. The prosecution hence argued that both the physical and mental elements of the offence were made out.
12        In her defence, the appellant denied that the signature on the impugned letter was a forgery but did not bring in another expert to support her case. She stuck by her statement in the affidavit that she had seen Fernando sign the impugned letter.
13        After a three-day trial, the judge found the appellant guilty of the charge and sentenced her to two years’ imprisonment.
Issues arising on appeal
14        The appellant contended that the sentence here was manifestly excessive on two main grounds: (i) the judge had failed to consider certain mitigating factors; and (ii) the sentence was out of line with previous similar cases.
Whether the judge had failed to consider certain mitigating factors
15        The appellant alleged that the judge had failed to consider two mitigating factors in this case. First, the appellant pointed out that the admission of the impugned letter as evidence could not have defeated Fernando’s claim against Mukunnan in the High Court Suit. She therefore argued that the consequences flowing from the perjury were trivial and should be taken into account by the judge in sentencing.
16        I found this argument unmeritorious. The impugned letter stated that Fernando would not enforce the surety against the Malta Consulate.In other words, it purported to render the surety arrangement inoperative. This would weaken Fernando’s case that the payments were loans and not business investments. It would be easier to characterise the payments as loans if there was a surety since as a matter of commercial practice, a surety was required for a loan and not for an investment. Without a binding surety arrangement, Fernando’s case that the payments were loans would clearly be undermined.
17        Secondly, the appellant pointed out that admission of the impugned letter as evidence in the High Court Suit had not in fact caused any financial losses to Fernando since the claim was eventually settled with a consent judgment in favour of Fernando. The appellant also did not gain financially from fabricating false evidence. The judge refused to consider this a valid mitigating factor.
18        I have emphasised on previous occasions that the fact that an offender made no financial gain or caused no financial loss to another from his crime was a legitimate mitigating factor but of very little weight: see 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
 and 
PP v Gurmit Singh
 
[1999] 3 SLR 215
. Although those cases were not decided in the context of the offence of fabricating false evidence, I was of the opinion that they should be followed in this appeal. The purpose behind the enactment of s 193 of the Penal Code is to deter any attempt to pervert the course of 
justice
 and the fact that there have been no 
personal
 gains or losses arising from the perjury can only be of little weight as a mitigating factor.
19        In a sense, the true victim of the offence of perjury is not an individual, but the course of justice itself. Judicial proceedings require all evidence to be as truthful as possible: the proper administration of justice is thwarted by false evidence whether or not such evidence leads to unfair gains or losses to an individual. As Russell L.J. stated succinctly in 
Abdulhamid Jamal Shamji
 [1989] 11 Cr. App. R. (S.) 587 at 589-590:
The circumstances in which perjury can be committed are infinite. Sometimes … as a result of perjury a defendant is wrongly convicted in a criminal trial and suffers imprisonment … sometimes the perjurer lies to save his own skin … Sometimes in civil proceedings, as these were, the effect of perjury is to cause financial loss to others, or, conversely, to enable to perjurer to gain financially. Those aggravating features are not present here … 
it must [however] always be remembered in cases of this kind one victim of perjury. That victim is the course of justice and its proper administration. Justice inevitably suffers whatever the motive for the perjury and in what circumstances it is committed…
it is because of that inevitable feature of the offence that a conviction for perjury must always be visited, save in the most exceptional circumstances that do not prevail here, with an immediate custodial sentence [Emphasis is added].
 
 
20        Hence the fact that the appellant had not gained financially, or that Fernando had not lost financially from the fabricated evidence was of little weight as a mitigating factor. Although the judge below went further than he should have and rejected this aspect of the case as a mitigating factor altogether, that alone was insufficient to overturn the sentence. I hence found no merit in this ground of appeal.
Whether the sentence here was out of line with previous similar cases
21        The appellant relied principally on the decision of 
Koh Pee Huat v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 235
. The accused there (‘Koh’) made a false statement in an affidavit which was filed in a maintenance claim involving his former wife (‘Fang’). The false statement asserted that the handwriting on certain papers was Fang’s. Koh was convicted of a charge of fabricating false evidence and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. On appeal, I reduced the sentence to one month’s imprisonment.
22        I emphasised that a short sentence was justified there only because of the exceptional circumstances in that case. It is important to note that in 
Koh Pee Huat
, the purpose of making the false statement was to show that Koh and Fang were interested in buying a new property. As it turned out however, Koh and Fang were indeed interested in buying a new property. In other words, the statement there, although in itself false, was tendered for the purpose of proving a fact which was actually true. The false statement there could not therefore have led to any unjust consequences. Such exceptional circumstances were not present in this appeal: the impugned letter was tendered in the High Court Suit to prove that Fernando 
did not
 have a case for repayment. As the consent judgment there showed, however, Fernando 
had
 a case for repayment. Admission of the impugned letter as evidence could therefore unjustly defeat Fernando’s claim against Mukunnan.
23        The appellant also cited several cases where sentences of less than two years’ imprisonment were imposed for the offence of fabricating false evidence for use in judicial proceedings. I was not convinced that those cases showed that the sentence here was manifestly excessive. I have emphasised on many occasions that, while consistency in sentencing was a desirable goal, this was not an inflexible or overriding principle. The different degrees of culpability and the unique circumstances of each case played an equally, if not more, important role. Furthermore, the sentences in similar cases might have been either too high or too low: 
Lim Poh Tee v PP
 
[2001] 1 SLR 674
; 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
 and 
Yong Siew Soon v PP
 
[1992] 2 SLR 933
.
24        In the present appeal, the appellant had carefully set out to deceive the High Court with the fabricated evidence. Instead of expressing remorse, she went on to spin a web of deceit in the trial below, hence wasting precious court time. She clearly had no regard for the solemn nature of swearing an affidavit and for judicial proceedings in Singapore. The sentence meted out by the court below was proportionate to the gravity of her conduct. For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal.

(delivering the grounds of decision of the court):The appellant was convicted of raping a young woman (the complainant), and of abetment of the rape of the complainant by another man, who was referred to in the course of the proceedings as Ah Huat. Ah Huat was separately charged with raping the complainant and with abetment of the rape of the complainant by the appellant.
The appellant was convicted on both charges, and sentenced to seven years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on the charge of rape, and seven years` imprisonment on the abetment charge; the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Ah Huat absconded following his arrest and was never brought to trial. The accused appealed against his convictions and sentence. We dismissed the appeal, and these are our reasons for having done so.
On the evening of 9 June 1984, the complainant went out in a foursome with the appellant, Ah Huat and a second young lady called Jessica. The complainant and the appellant had known each other for about a year, and had been out on a number of occasions in the company of others. There had been, inter alia, an overnight excursion to Desaru, and the complainant had visited the appellant`s home over the Lunar New Year in 1984. They each possessed the other`s telephone number. Jessica was an acquaintance of the complainant`s, and Ah Huat was also known to the complainant, although she did not know him anything like as well as she knew the appellant.
At about 9pm on 9 June the group had dinner at a coffee shop in Changi, and eventually proceeded to the Music Room, a discotheque at the Hilton Hotel. They arrived there at about midnight and left when the establishment closed at about 2.45am on the morning of 10 June. All four had drunk beer and danced. The complainant estimated that she drank `about two glasses` of beer, which resulted in her feeling `a little tipsy`. She had had to go to the toilet several times. After leaving the discotheque, Jessica was dropped off at her home. Her companions then drove towards the city, stopping at the Sea View Hotel on the way to make use of the toilets. They next stopped in a car park close to the Transit Food Centre near High Street.
The prosecution`s case was that the offences with which the appellant and Ah Huat stood charged were committed by them at No 22, North Bridge Road (No 22), a shophouse situated close to the Transit Food Centre car park. The evidence of the complainant, in a nutshell, was that she was forced onto a bed, in a room on the second storey of No 22, and held down by Ah Huat while she was raped by the appellant; and that she was then raped by Ah Huat while the appellant held her down. It was common ground that the appellant drove the complainant home at about 5am, after the visit to No 22. She telephoned her sister at about 11am and complained that she had been raped by the appellant and another man, and at about noon she told her mother, sister and a friend, Angela, about it. She made a report at Toa Payoh police station at 3pm the same day, and at about 7.10pm she was seen by Dr Yeo Seow Heong. Dr Yeo found her to be non virgo intacta. His examination revealed a fresh tear of the hymenal ring. Swabs established the presence of seminal acid phosphates and spermatozoa. Dr Yeo concluded that his findings were consistent with the complainant having had recent sexual intercourse. However, apart from a few superficial scratch marks on both her shoulders, which may have been caused by finger nails, no injuries of any nature were found on, or in, any part of her person. The complainant`s dress was found to be undamaged, as was her underwear, but the dress was found to be stained with semen of Ah Huat`s group. The appellant`s trousers were stained with semen, but its group was not established and in any event the appellant had declined to provide a specimen. The mattress on the bed at No 22 was found to be stained with semen of a group other than that to which Ah Huat`s semen belonged.
The appellant was arrested at his home at about 12.30am on the morning of 12 June. He was told that he had been accused of rape by the complainant, who was present and identified him. At 2.25am on the same morning, he was charged with raping the complainant and a statement (the first statement) was recorded from the appellant pursuant to s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Ah Huat was arrested at about 11.30am on 12 June. On 16 June it was decided to charge the appellant with having abetted the rape of the complainant by Ah Huat. At about 1.30pm that afternoon a statement (the second statement) was recorded from the appellant under s 121(6) in relation to the abetment charge.
The admissibility of both the first and second statements was challenged at the trial. At the conclusion of the voire dire, and before the learned trial judge ruled on admissibility, counsel for the appellant conceded that the second statement was voluntary, and asked for it to go in. The learned judge held that the first statement was also voluntarily made, and therefore admissible. That determination was not challenged in the course of the appeal before us.
The first statement was in the following terms: 
 
On the said day and time, I was never at the said place. I was then at the Music Room, Hilton Hotel. I do not know where is 22, North Bridge Road. I did not use force to rape the said girl. It was at about 4am, that we were together alone in my car at the carpark of North Boat Quay. We were then kissing and hugging each other. She was a willing partner. I assisted to remove her panties. She also assisted me to pull my pants down. I then lie on top of her and used my penis to rub her vagina. The whole incident lasted only half an hour and she masturbated for me. My sperm ejaculated and spilled onto her abdomen. That is all I have to say at this stage except that we separated unhappily due to some quarrels.
 
 
 
In the second statement, the appellant said: 
 
I, Liew Kim Yong, deny that on 10 June 1984 at 3.05am, I ever instigated Pan Quing Fa (Ah Huat), my business associate, to rape (the complainant). As (the complainant) is my good friend, we are both willing (?) (not rape). I do not know whether Quing Fa had ever raped her. I was not at the abovementioned place at 3.05am. Please forgive me. As for the other charges, I was not told about them. Quing Fa and I are good business associates. I did not do such a thing. Thank you.
 
 
 
A statement recorded from the complainant`s mother was read, and she was not cross-examined on it. The deponent stated that she had found the complainant on her bed, crying, at 8am on the morning of 10 June. The complainant declined to say what was upsetting her. The trial judge also heard evidence from an older married sister who said that she received a telephone call from a sobbing complainant at about 11am on the morning of 10 June, saying that she had been raped by the appellant and by another man. The sister went to the home of her parents, with whom the complainant stayed, and found the complainant in tears, with her mother and her best friend Angela by her side, trying to console her. The complainant led all three of them to a nearby playground where she told them about the incident.
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case, counsel for the appellant did not submit that no case against the accused had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The learned trial judge called upon the appellant to enter on his defence. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He admitted that he went to No 22 with the complainant shortly after 3am on the morning of 10 June, and that they had had sexual intercourse there, the complainant having been wholly co-operative and willing. It followed that the appellant was disavowing the first statement as a total fabrication. The appellant went on to say in his evidence that after intercourse with the complainant, he walked out of the bedroom to go and wash in the bathroom, and was surprised to see Ah Huat on the landing. The arrangement had been that Ah Huat would wait in the office on the ground floor. In any event, the appellant proceeded to the bathroom, leaving Ah Huat on the landing. He returned to the bedroom four or five minutes later, and the burden of his evidence was that Ah Huat, taking advantage of his absence in the bathroom, had sneaked into the unlit bedroom, been mistaken by the complainant for the appellant, and had had intercourse with the complainant while she was under that misapprehension. Upon the complainant realizing that she had had intercourse with Ah Huat, and thinking that the appellant and Ah Huat had engineered the event, she had become very angry, and had been taken home, in a state of high dudgeon, by the appellant. It followed from the appellant`s own evidence that the second statement was false in at least one important respect, namely, the appellant`s claim that he was not at No 22 at the time when Ah Huat was alleged to have raped the complainant.
The appellant`s essential complaint in the appeal was that the learned trial judge accepted the complainant`s version of what took place without an adequate analysis of her evidence in what were said to be crucial areas. Both parties were well known to each other, and during the year or so that he had known her prior to 10 June 1984 the appellant had invariably behaved with propriety towards her. Was it credible, in the light of his earlier conduct, that he raped the complainant, a year into their friendship, and that he had had a hand in the raping of her by Ah Huat?
The complainant was not a habitual drinker, and would have been more susceptible to drink than most. Yet, it was argued, the learned trial judge had failed to consider the effect on the complainant of the beer she had drunk. He was obliged to do so, even though he had received no guidance in this respect from counsel for the appellant at the trial. The complainant had been vague as to what had been done to her; in telling her mother, sister and Angela about the incident, the complainant, who was not naive, had said that she did not know whether the appellant`s penis had entered her vagina until it was explained to her by them that, by reason of the pain she had experienced, this must have occurred. If she did not know what was happening to her as a result of drink, that, said counsel, went to consent, and the probability of rape began to recede. It is also well known, counsel went on, that alcohol impairs memory for recent events. Come the dawn, after uncharacteristic sexual conduct - the complainant having been a virgin - remorse, post-coital regret and anger sets in. In those circumstances, how much reliance could be placed on the complainant`s evidence?
Counsel referred to a number of weaknesses and inconsistencies in the complainant`s evidence. We will refer only to those which counsel considered to be the most significant. Firstly, the complainant had said in her police report that the complainant and Ah Huat had carried her up the stairs of No 22. Yet in her evidence she had stated that the appellant went upstairs first, followed by the complainant, with Ah Huat bringing up the rear. This was a grave discrepancy, which not only went to the complainant`s reliability, but also to consent. Secondly, the complainant had given evidence of a struggle. She had said that there had been pushing, pulling and pinning down in the commission of a double rape. But, apart from scratches on both shoulders (to which the complainant had not alluded when she was medically examined, and which the doctor had clearly regarded as insignificant), there were no injuries whatsoever; no bruising or reddening of the skin; no tenderness around the vulva or in the vagina; no damage to the complainant`s dress or underwear. Nothing. Was that, counsel asked, consistent with a struggle having taken place?
Thirdly, the complainant had said that she was menstruating at the time of the alleged offence. Yet no blood had been found on the bed, the pillows or the bedclothes. It was therefore right for the judge to have been sceptical of the complainant`s assertion that she would not (apart from any other reason) have consented to intercourse during a menstruation. Fourthly, there had been no `fresh complaint`. The complainant`s mother, who was not strict and with whom the complainant had a good relationship, had entered the complainant`s bedroom at about 8am, and had found the complainant in tears. Yet the complainant had told her mother nothing. This, it was said, went to the heart of the complainant`s reliability. Lastly, there had been no allegation on the complainant`s part, of a threat; there had been no weapon; she had not screamed; in short there was a total absence of the stock characteristics of a rape, let alone a double rape, and where independent evidence existed, it tended to undermine rather than support the complainant.
Counsel for the appellant conceded that corroboration is not essential in law. However, corroboration is a matter of prudence and practice, and the learned trial judge had been wrong to conclude that the complainant had complained as soon as she could, and that by her complaint she had corroborated herself She had arrived home at about 5.50am; she had said nothing to her mother at 8am; she had failed to telephone her sister until hours later, and the complaint was eventually cross-examined out of her by her mother, sister and Angela. Although s 159 of the Evidence Act seems to suggest that a witness may corroborate himself, that cannot have been what the legislature intended. The fact that the complainant was seen to be crying on the morning of 10 June was, at most, evidence of consistency and was not corroboration. In the result, the learned trial judge, as the finder of fact, had failed to direct himself to the necessity for, and the absence of, corroboration, and the conviction was accordingly unsafe.
It could be said, argued counsel, that at the end of the prosecution`s case the appellant ought not to have been called upon to enter upon his defence, since the essential ingredients of the offences had not been proved. Even if that were wrong, and the appellant was correctly called upon to make his defence, there were so many inconsistencies in the case against the appellant, it was so flawed for absence of corroboration and otherwise, that a reasonable doubt had arisen and the appellant should have been acquitted at the end of the day.
We deal first with the submission that the defence ought not to have been called, a point not taken in the petition of appeal. In our judgment, it is plain on the face of the record, and it was not submitted otherwise by counsel for the appellant at the trial, that when the prosecution concluded, a case had been made out which if unrebutted would have warranted his conviction. The test in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  (which counsel for the appellant submitted, in passing, was wrongly decided by the Privy Council but by which, he was obliged to concede, we are bound), was demonstrably passed. Once that hurdle had been got over by the prosecution, the learned judge was entitled to set the appellant`s version of events against that of the complainant`s. It is evident that he did so with considerable care, and that his conclusion was that the complainant was a truthful witness, and that the appellant had lied.
We leave the subject of drink with the observation that the appellant had also been drinking (16 beers had been ordered during the course of the outing). To turn an argument advanced on behalf of the appellant against him, it is perfectly possible that it was drink that led the appellant to behave in a manner which was wholly uncharacteristic of his conduct towards the complainant earlier in their friendship. As to the principal inconsistencies in the complainant`s evidence, it is clear that the learned trial judge was alive to them. He said: 
 
Jackie had in all honesty admitted that there were variations between her account of the incident in the bedroom at No 22 North Bridge Road both at the preliminary inquiry and whilst under cross-examination on the one hand, and whilst testifying in-chief on the other. Now what were these variations about? Not about when or where she had been raped. And most certainly not about who had raped her. The differences were merely about the sequence of events just before and during the time she was being ravished by the two men in the dark. Merely about details of who did what in the dark.
 
 
 
and again: 
 
Much was also made by the defence of the first information report exh p 23 made by (the complainant) where it was stated that `they carried me upstairs` and (the complainant) had not named the second person who had raped her. Jackie was quite adamant during her testimony that she was not carried up the stairs by the two men to the top landing of No 22 North Bridge Road. She said she did not use the word `carried` when making the report, though the recording officer, ex-Sgt Peter Giang (PW5) stated that she did. However, Sgt Giang confirmed that Jackie spoke in `simple English`. Jackie was educated in the Chinese stream until secondary three. Her main dialect of communication was Teochew and she had to make the report in English, a language she was not fluent in. In fact she had to be assisted in making the report by her friend Angela Tay. There was a probability that there was a miscommunication between Jackie and the recording officer.
 
 
 
Jackie did not know the actual name of Ah Huat. She had known him as `Ah Huat` and `Char-less`. She had met him only once previously. She had told the Sgt that she did not know the name of the Indonesian man. That was not a lie. There was no reason why she should have lied. She knew the accused`s name and so named him in the report as `Bernard Liew`.
It is a fact that no injuries were found upon the complainant other than the scratches on her shoulders. That is perhaps unusual, but the absence of other injuries clearly did not raise a reasonable doubt in the learned judge`s mind as to the complainant`s credibility. Although she was forced onto the bed, this was not a case involving the degree of violence that is often visited upon victims of rape. The learned judge found that the scratches on the shoulders were consistent with the complainant having been held down. It was not suggested to the doctor who examined the complainant that it was surprising for a rape victim who was previously virgo intacta not to have suffered bruising in the region of the vulva and in the vaginal passage. Had that been put, he might well have pointed out that menstrual blood in a victim who was having a period could have acted as a lubricant, and have prevented the bruising which would otherwise have occurred. That the complainant was menstruating is beyond doubt - the appellant said that he wiped her blood off the bed sheet and disposed of her sanitary pad.
We dismissed the criticism that the learned trial judge failed to take cognizance of the absence of a `fresh complaint`. He found that the complainant complained `as soon as she could`. It was understandable that she did not tell her mother about the incident when she was found, distressed, on her bed at 8am on the morning of the offence. The complainant said: 
 
I was afraid to tell my mother. I was afraid she might scold me and blame me. I was also afraid she might not be able to stand the shock.
 
 
 
She telephoned her sister later in the morning. 
 
I requested her to come over immediately. She asked me what the matter was. I told her I had something important to tell her. She kept pestering me and I then told her briefly that I was raped. She asked me `who`. I said one person was called Bernard, (the appellant).
 
 
 
As to the effect on her of the beer that she had drunk, the complainant volunteered that she was `a bit tipsy`. Nowhere in his evidence did the appellant even hint that the complainant was visibly affected by drink, nor was it suggested by him, or on his behalf, that drink may have led to actual consent, or to the failure by the complainant to communicate absence of consent.
The criticism that the learned judge had not taken into account the effect of drink was not justified. He did not ignore the fact that the complainant was slightly intoxicated. He said: 
 
How could any girl, who was being raped by two men, be expected to remember in detail and in the exact sequence the course of events? Even a girl who had had sexual intercourse willingly with a partner could not be expected to recall and narrate in detail every step in their love-making. In this case Jackie was frightened, confused and upset at what they were doing to her and was also a bit tipsy. How could she be expected to narrate accurately and in sequence the acts of rape? Where her hands and legs were at various stages of the rape, where the accused and Ah Huat were exactly supposed to have held her. I find that Jackie`s evidence was credible and capable of belief.
 
 
 
When the complainant telephoned her sister on the morning of 10 June, she stated unequivocally that she had been raped, that is to say that there had been penetration. It is true that later in the day, when recounting the incident to her mother, her sister and Angela, the complainant had said that there had been pain but that she did not know if there had been penetration. That apparently surprising statement is explained by the complainant`s evident reluctance to speak to her mother about the episode, illustrated by her refusal to communicate when she was seen crying by her mother at 8am.
It is clear from a plain reading of s 159 of the Evidence Act that evidence of the complaint to the sister on the telephone, and then the complaint to the mother, sister and Angela was admissible as corroboration of the complainant`s own evidence as to the offence. It is clear that the learned trial judge looked for corroboration and properly regarded that evidence as corroborative, that is to say as evidence which confirmed in material particulars, not only that the complainant had been raped, but also that the appellant had raped her - see 
 R v Beck 
[1982] 1 All ER 807.
The learned trial judge found that the complainant`s `distressed condition` when she was seen by her mother at 8am on 10 June, `lent support to her story of being raped`. It is well-established that there must be a guarded approach to ex post facto crying or distress as evidence of corroboration - see, for example, 
 R v Wilson 
(1979) 58 Cr App R 304 - because distress might result from other causes dissociated from the alleged offence; or the complainant `might be putting on an act or simulating distress` - the words of Lord Parker CJ in 
 R v Redpath 
(1962) 46 Cr App R 319. That the learned trial judge warned himself of the danger is manifest. In doing so, he adopted Lord Parker`s phraseology: 
 
Jackie`s mother had found her in a distressed state barely a few hours after the rape. The circumstances under which the mother found her did not suggest that Jackie was putting on an act and was simulating distress. Her mother had found her crying in the bedroom and, when questioned, had refused to tell the mother what had happened because she was too ashamed to do so. Jackie`s distressed condition lent support to her story of being raped.
 
 
 
It is right to observe, in any event, that the trial judge seems to have concluded, by the use of the words lent support to the story that the evidence of distress fell somewhat short of corroboration, in the accepted sense of confirmation, and amounted to little more than evidence of consistency.
Counsel for the appellant conceded at the outset of his argument that he had a considerable task ahead of him in the appeal against conviction, for the reason that the learned judge found the complainant to be a witness of truth and the appellant to be a liar. We were obliged to agree, and determined at the conclusion of argument that the task was one which counsel had been unable to accomplish. The appeal against conviction was accordingly dismissed.
We gave anxious consideration to what was said on the appellant`s behalf in the appeal against sentence. There had been no violent assault, no weapon, no threats; the complainant was a worldly young woman, the relationship between her and the appellant prior to the offence had been pleasant and easy-going; they had been drinking; and the appellant had driven her home after the offence and telephoned her the next day. Thus it is true to say that many of the aggravating features of a rape were absent. It was also urged upon us that the appellant is allergic to pain-killing drugs, and that the sentence of caning ought to be set aside on this ground as well, since the consequences would be very painful if that part of the sentence were carried out.
In the event, we dismissed the appeal against sentence as well. Rape involves an element of depravity, and the more so does a double rape. There was more than a hint of premeditation - a game of forfeits with which the complainant was unfamiliar, resulting in her, a nondrinker, consuming two glasses of beer; dropping Jessica first when the complainant had expressly asked to be taken home; going to the High Street car park close to No 22, to which the appellant had access. It is clear, too, that the complainant was severely shocked, distressed and humiliated. The learned trial judge evidently looked at the two offences, in effect, as one transaction, and imposed sentences which cannot under any circumstances be described as manifestly excessive. We were not disposed to interfere with the sentence of caning on the grounds of the appellant`s allergy to analgesics. That was not a matter which we were disposed to take into account, although it will no doubt have been borne in mind by those concerned with the execution of that part of the sentence, if drawn to their attention.

Background
 
 
1          The accused Lim Beng Cheok (“Lim”), also known as Philip Lim, faced a total of 56 charges under s 377 and 377A of the Penal Code and one charge under the Films Act (Cap 107).  The prosecution proceeded with ten charges i.e five charges of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 Penal Code and five charges of committing an act of gross indecency with a male person under s 377A of the Penal Code.  The offences under these ten charges are in respect of five boys aged 13 to 15 at the time of the offences and span over one year from December 2000 to February 2002.  I will refer to the five boys as Ong, Sim, Chua, Hong and Goh.
2          At the time of the offences, Lim was a mathematics tutor who gave tuition from his home at Ang Mo Kio. 
3          The circumstances as to how the five victims were introduced to Lim were similar.  The parents of the five victims received word that Lim was an effective mathematics tutor.  They were weak in their grasp of mathematics and their parents were concerned about this.  Lim was engaged to tutor the five victims.  He was trusted for his tuition methods.  Some of the victims, like other students, had at some point of time either resided with him at the flat or would stay over at his flat on occasions, usually just prior to the school examination.  Lim provided meals and lodging for them.  He was a stern and demanding tutor who would not hesitate to resort to corporal punishment to enforce discipline and exact obedience from his students.
4          The offences came to light because a psychologist in Ong’s school was informed by his form teacher that there had been a noticeable deterioration in Ong’s attitude towards his mother and schoolwork and Ong had run away from home.  It was in the third counselling session with Ong and after probing that the psychologist discovered that Lim had sexually abused Ong and other boys.
5          Lim pleaded guilty to the ten charges and was convicted accordingly.  He consented to the remaining 47 charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
Lim’s character and contributions
6          Mr Lee Teck Leng, Counsel for Lim, submitted that good character was a mitigating factor, citing two cases.  In 
Melvani v Public Prosecutor
 [1969-1971] SLR 464, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin (as he then was) said that “good character is always a circumstance which a court ought to consider in assessing sentence”.  In 
Siah Ooi Choe v Public Prosecutor
 
[1988] SLR 402
, L P Thean J (as he then was) had taken into account the background of the appellant’s character and his contribution to society and the country.
7          Mr Imran Hamid for the prosecution, relied on 
Chan Mei Yoong Letticia v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 2 SLR 465
 to submit that good character should not have any effect on sentencing in the case before me.
8          However, I noted that in 
Letticia’s
 case, the offence was one under the Immigration Act (Cap 133).  That may be why the impressive testimonial of the good character of the accused there failed to mitigate the benchmark sentence.
9          On the question of good character and contribution to society, Mr Lee presented an impressive array of testimonials i.e 87 from Lim’s former students and eight from his former students’ parents.  In addition, there was a testimonial from the Management Committee of Kwang Im Tng Buddhist Temple at Balestier Road.  Some of the persons who wrote the testimonials appeared to be aware of the nature of the charges which Lim was facing.  Moreover, some of those who had given testimonials were present in court on the day when submissions on sentencing were made.
10        I will cite from a few of the testimonials as that will give a better perspective of the beneficial effect Lim had had on many of his students:
Testimonial from Chan Wei Gan (Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Officer of 6 SIR)
“<
INTRODUCTIONS>
            It has taken me some time to pen down my feelings and thoughts surrounding the recent news that I have come to know.  I write this note with a heavy heart, and this is written as a testimony to a man whom I have the utmost respect and admiration for.  I can only hope this note of mine, and that of many others could bear witness how much Mr Philip Lim has been a blessing to many people who have the fortunate opportunity to encounter his kindness and grace.
<
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES>
            …
            Suffice it to say that I was a very immature and stubborn 15 year old when I first met Philip.  I was a student with poor grades, and was just promoted to Secondary 3 after repeating a year in Secondary 2.  I remember my mid-year exam results were ‘full of reds’ and it was clear that I was having difficulty in coping with my studies, in particular in both Elementary and Additional Mathematics.  The future for me then was gloomy and uncertain, and I was overcome with a sense of hopelessness and the lack of will power to strive.  It was then that a mutual friend recommended me to Philip.
            Philip was introduced to me as a gifted and ‘Super-power’ tutor.  I have come across stories of him giving free tuition to students who are poor both financially and academically, and performing magic by turning their Mathematics grades from ‘F’ to ‘A’.  I soon found out a great deal more about him - selfless, compassionate, kind-hearted - are some of the words that come to my mind instinctively to best describe him. …
            I owe a lot to Philip, and I guess I will always be indebted to him.  Philip had helped me cope, not just with my studies then but with life till this day, instilling in me what are the few of my cornerstone - principles in life.  In short, he has touched and changed my life. …
            When I was in Sec 3, I came to be acquainted with a group of lower secondary boys who in my opinion then, were “hopeless students”.  They were not only behaving as bullies amongst their peers, but were also seen as ‘incorrigibles’ by teachers and staff of the school.  They were also recruited by gangsters to participate in gang related activities outside school premises.  As two of the boys were in the same school brass band which I served as an active committee member, I brought this matter to the attention of Philip, since I was confident that Philip would be able to help these perceived outcasts.  I knew he would, as I was too, a recipient of his kindness and grace.  And he did.
            He took them under his wings and became their Guardian Angel.  He bravely confronted their gangster leader, and negotiated for their ‘release’ from the gang formation.  Although he refused to let me in on the proceedings then, I subsequently found out that he did what no other teacher would have done for their students.  He not only has to pay the gangster ‘compensation’ monies but also to beg for forgiveness on his students’ behalf.  Philip finally led these way-ward acquaintances of mine away from the mess, and help them to take the first step towards the right direction.  The life of these people was changed from that very moment, and all of them went on to graduate from polytechnics and university subsequently, and they now lead meaningful lives, gainfully employed and contributing to the society.
            …
            Another incident that I would [
sic
] to highlight is the time when I was doing my tertiary study in Manchester from 1988 to 1991.  My younger brother, Wei Ping was badly injured in a freak accident in camp whilst serving National Service Full-time.  He was hospitalised and had to undergo surgery for his severe injury.  My parents were quite depressed, and were at a loss at that time - especially so since their only other son was away in England pursuing his studies.  They guardedly kept the news from me, as they didn’t want it to affect my studies.
            During these trying times, Philip was their main pillar of strength.  Not only did he make the necessary administrative and medical arrangements for them, but also kept vigil at my brother’s bedside whenever he needed him.  He and his students took turns to look after my brothers and parents, and attended to their every need.  When my brother was finally discharged from the hospital after weeks of hospitalisation, he went as far as organising a homecoming party for him.  Such compassion and kindness are precisely the sort of gestures Philip readily offer his students, exuding genuine care and concerns for them.”
Testimonial from LTC Giam Hock Koon, Head Budgets & Force Plans Branch, Naval Plans Department - HQ RSN
“           … Where he himself was not able to help in a certain subject, like English, Literature or Geography, he would make arrangements for his ex-students with the aptitude in these subjects to help guide the weaker students.  In the run up to the exams, we studied together at his house, and he would take it upon himself to provide food and drinks as we prepared for our exams.  To Philip, no effort or expense was too great in preparing us for the exams.
            My respect for Mr Philip Lim (we call him “Sir”), however, is not because of his professional skills as a tutor, but because he is a selfless individual who would go to any length to help others, for example:
            - He has helped some in my cohort of students to get out of gangs.  He personally met with the gang elders to plead for the “release” of his students, not without some degree of personal risk to himself.  20 years on, these very students who he had “rescued” are doing well in their careers and family life, whereas had if [
sic
] not for Philip, the outcome would probably have been very different.
            - He helps out at temples and charitable organisations.  This was so 20 years ago, and it has been the case up to his recent detention.  This has rubbed off on many of his students who follow his example in doing similar work.
            - He would waiver [
sic
] fees for many of the students from less well off families, and on occasions, would lend a helping hand to help resolve the financial [
sic
] of students and friends who fall on hard times.
            - He had the ability to see the positive side to any individual.  To him there is no person for whom there is ‘no hope’, provided the individual was willing to make the effort to improve.
…
            It was therefore a tremendous shock for me to learn of his current situation.  To this day, I have extreme difficulties reconciling the character of the person that I know for such a long time, with the allegations that are currently leveled against him.  I urge that in passing judgement, full consideration be given to the many positive contributions Mr Philip Lim has made.”
Testimonial from Chow Yeng Har, a parent of Lim’s student (English translation)
“Honourable Judge
…
Under Philip Lim’s guidance over a period of time, my son began to show care and concern for the people around him.  He respects the elders.  He cares about others feeling.  Not only that, my son used to follow Mr. Lim to the temple to do voluntary work, and distribute “HongBao”.  He even brings along the students to the market to help a fruit store hawker to sell fruits.  (The hawker was sick during that peak period and does not have assistant).
…
As a parent, I was surprised that during some occasions like, his birthday, teachers’ day, prayers day, lunar festival, Chinese New Year etc., the students will come in groups and gather around him.  Some have been doing this for the past twenty years without fail.  I also amazed that the way the students and their parents respect him and addressed him as “Sir”.
In life, everyone makes mistakes either in work or behavior.  It is not easy to manage on psychological, socially, philosophy, reform and sexuality.  In view that he has contributed his duty towards the society, I pray that Your Honour would be understanding and grant light sentencing.
The students have been worrying for him for a period of time.  They have travelling tirelessly to and from the prison to visit him and to give him moral support.  They have tried their best to support their “Sir” (during his imprisonment, some even gave tuition to raise monies to engage a lawyer to represent him and some do house cleaning for him as his [
sic
] is single). …
…
As a parent, we were heartache over his misdeed.  It is unbearable to see that he has to endure the pain and suffering of imprisonment.
Once again I hope that Your Honour have mercy.  We promised to take good care of him, offer him counselling, help him and support him to live a new life so that he does not make mistake again.” 
Impact on the victims
11        The impact on the victims is set out in the Statement of Facts which includes the report of Dr Cai Yiming of the Child Guidance Clinic of the Institute of Health on each of the victims.  Dr Cai is Senior Consultant and the Head of the Clinic.
Ong
12        In the Statement of Facts, it is stated that Ong had confided to the school counsellor his concern about contracting sexually transmitted diseases.  He was also afraid that he might be labelled as “gay”.  He was confused and felt partly to blame as he felt good during the acts.  He was hesitant to go to the police.
13        During the examination by Dr Cai, Ong was co-operative and forthcoming.
14        As a result of the sexual abuse, Ong blamed his stepfather and mother (“his parents”) for sending him for tuition under Lim.  He hated his parents.  He also blamed Lim for giving him horrible times as he felt shameful that the events had surfaced.  However, he had no intrusive memory or flashback.  Dr Cai recommended continued counselling for one year as Ong had a lot of anger and hate against his parents.
Sim
15        Dr Cai described Sim as friendly and co-operative.
16        Sim had not dared to say “no” to Lim nor tell his own parents as he was afraid of the spiritual power of Lim whom he believed was a disciple of “Tua Peh Kong”.
17        Sim felt guilty.  He felt abused sexually and considered himself no longer a virgin.  Memories of Lim kept coming to his mind and he was worried that Lim might harm his family.  He had nightmares about Lim coming to kill his parents and him.  However, I noted that Dr Cai’s report did not allege that any specific threat had been made by Lim against Sim.
18        Dr Cai concluded that Sim had signs and symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  For this, counselling was recommended for at least the next one year.
Chua
19        Dr Cai said that Chua appeared shy and embarrassed about what had happened to him.  Nevertheless, he was co-operative and forthcoming.  Sometime in June or July 2000, Lim had asked him if he had ever watched pornography before and touched his private part.  This was in Lim’s room (in Lim’s flat).  Chua was a bit scared and Lim told him to calm down.  From then on, Lim helped him and they masturbated each other and performed mutual oral sex.
20        Chua said he did enjoy the acts and Lim did not use any threat or force on him.  However, he did not tell anyone as he was embarrassed.  He had no signs and symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Hong
21        Hong also appeared shy and embarrassed about what had happened.  Nevertheless, he was co-operative and forthcoming during his session with Dr Cai.
22        Hong was still grateful to Lim and had a high regard for him as a tutor and his teaching methods.
23        It was sometime in the middle of 2001 when Lim asked Hong to let another boy have a look at his penis.  He obliged out of deference to Lim and also to satisfy the curiosity of the other boy.  This went on with Lim helping Hong to masturbate and this progressed to mutual masturbation.  There was no oral sex between them.  Hong was not at ease at first but Lim gave a veiled threat of cutting him off emotionally and he gave in.  As a result, he had a bit of self-blame as he did not reject outright the advance of Lim.
24        After the police stepped in to investigate, Hong felt embarrassed and worried that others might know about his past activities.  He had some difficulty facing his parents, friends and teachers initially but he was all right now.  He had no signs and symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
25        Mr Lee also submitted that Hong’s brother also wrote a testimonial for Lim stating, “His kindness is something I will not be able to repay”.
Goh
26        During Dr Cai’s examination, Goh was in a relaxed and cheerful mood.  He was also forthcoming and co-operative.
27        In November 2001, Lim had hugged Goh and kissed his cheek lightly, progressing to touching his private part.  Later, Lim helped him to masturbate a few times.  Once or twice, he masturbated Lim, under Lim’s direction.
28        Goh was shocked at first and Lim told him not to tell anyone.  Goh was worried that should he disclose to his parents, his parents might stop his tuition and his results in Mathematics might drop.  He was quite happy with the tuition under the accused as his results in Mathematics improved significantly.  He still held Lim in high esteem as a tutor.
29        Goh did not have recurrent thoughts or intrusive memories of these events and had no signs and symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
30        Mr Lee also submitted that Goh had visited Lim in remand with the permission of his parents.
Reports on Lim
31        The prosecution relied on reports of Dr Kenneth Koh of the Institute of Mental Health, Woodbridge Hospital.  Dr Koh is the Registrar of Department of Forensic Psychiatry.  In his report dated 27 August 2002, Dr Koh said that Lim came from a family of ten siblings whom he hardly kept in contact with.  His tuition was to male students in secondary school as he claimed to have had bad experiences with female students who cried when he scolded them.
32        Lim was a homosexual and his first sexual encounter was while he was doing National Service.
33        I note from the report that Lim had admitted to sexual activity, similar to those for which he was being charged, with previous students.  However, Lim could not remember exactly when and with how many.  During the hearing before me, Mr Lee was instructed that the previous occasions happened two or three times a long time ago and comprised masturbation.
34        During examination by Dr Koh, Lim was calm although worried about the sentence he would receive.  Lim was coherent and did not display any psychotic symptoms or anything which would suggest a major mood disorder.
35        Dr Koh was of the opinion that Lim has paedophilia (sexually attracted to males).
36        In his second report dated 27 November 2002, Dr Koh was of the view that there was a high rate of recidivism, relying on statistics from the British Journal of Criminology.  He was of the opinion that Lim posed a danger to young boys.
37        The defence obtained an opinion from Dr Tian Choong Sing of The Psychotherapy Clinic for Adults and Children (Ang & Kong).  Prior to entering into private practice, Dr Tian was working at the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health and was its Senior Registrar.  Dr Tian said that Lim was spontaneous and co-operative.  There was no psychotic features.  In his conclusion, he said:
Conclusion
In conclusion, Mr. L appears to be a rather simple, naïve and lonely man who is socially isolated and has little interactions with the outside world other than with his students.
The development of his sexual orientation was affected by his upbringing and the early sexual victimization by his neighbour.
I am of the opinion that he was not able to find more appropriate channels of outlet for his sexual need because of his limited social circle and poor social skills.  As such, he began to rationalize the choice of his students for his homosexual acts, thinking that they were in a way ‘helping’ his students to relieve their sexual tension and urges.  He also rationalized that it must be alright as he had their consent to participate in those acts and had not resorted to any force or trickery.
In considering these factors, I do not agree with Dr. Kenneth Koh’s opinion that Mr. Lim poses a danger to young boys.  He had not sought out his victims in a premeditated manner.  There were no trickery, violence or the use of threats.
Mr. Lim is remorseful of his actions.  He is concerned about the impact of his actions in the lives of his students and is worried that they would be punished for their involvement.  He is now aware of the severity of the offence and is ashamed to meet up with his ex-students and their parents who have been supporting him.  I am of the opinion that given proper therapy, the risk of recidivism can be significantly reduced.
…
38        In his response dated 3 March 2003, Dr Koh was of the view that the many testimonials describing Lim to be resourceful in acquiring aid for his students and organising his boys to do charity work appeared to contradict Dr Tian’s description of Lim as being naïve.
39        As for Dr Tian’s view that the acts were not premeditated, Dr Koh said that the liaisons were not chance encounters between strangers.  Lim had time to develop trust and to assert his authority over the victims.  There was thus no need for trickery, violence or threats.  The mentor-tutee relationship demanded a certain amount of obedience on the part of the students.  Dr Koh maintained that there was a high rate of recidivism and said that the fact that Lim faced 56 charges was evidence of a repeated pattern of behaviour.  He also pointed out that Lim appeared to be aware of his sexual problem but did not seek treatment.  Dr Koh was prepared to agree that Lim was a good tutor and character builder and Lim may have been of good character in many respects.  However, one aspect of Lim was grossly aberrant.
Sentencing guides and submissions
40        On the facts before me, the most helpful case on sentencing under s 377 of the Penal Code was that of 
Adam bin Darsin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 2 SLR 412
.  There, the accused was also charged under s 377 for committing fellatio on his victims.  He pleaded guilty to eight charges in respect of eight victims, with 15 other similar charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  L P Thean JA (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, considered three forms of unnatural carnal intercourse under s 377 and was of the view that:
(a)        where an accused committed anal intercourse on a victim, this activity was the most serious as it involved some degree of coercion and violence,
(b)        where an accused performed fellatio on the victim (as in 
Adam’s
 case), this activity was the least serious.
Thean JA implied that where the accused coerced or cajoled a victim to perform fellatio on him, this would be of intermediate gravity.
41        There, Thean JA said in para 23:
23         In our judgment, an appropriate sentence for an offence of unnatural carnal intercourse such as that committed by the appellant in this case would be in the region of five years, subject to any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may be present.  In this case, the appellant had no previous conviction of similar offences and no harm or injury had been inflicted on the victims.  Nor are there any significant mitigating or aggravating factors.
42        I hasten to stress that all three forms of unnatural carnal intercourse are offences not to be taken lightly and the point about performing fellatio on a victim being the least serious is only relative to the other two forms of unnatural carnal intercourse.
43        Of the 56 charges faced by Lim:
(a)        11 were charges under s 377 Penal Code,
(b)        the remaining 45 charges were under s 377A.
44        Of the 11 charges under s 377:
(a)        eight were instances where Lim performed fellatio on the victim, and
(b)        the remaining three were instances where Lim told the victim to perform fellatio on him.
45        Of the 45 charges under s 377A:
(a)        42 were in respect of Lim using his hand to masturbate the penis of one of the victims,
(b)        one was in respect of Lim’s instigating a victim to masturbate Lim’s penis,
(c)        two were in respect of Lim’s telling a victim to masturbate another victim.
46        The ten charges which Lim pleaded guilty to was a mixture of the above acts, but excluding the one stated in para 45(b) above.
47        Mr Lee sought to distinguish the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
 and relied on 
Public Prosecutor v Raymond Pok
 
[2003] SGHC 18
, a decision by Justice Tay Yong Kwang where Tay J sentenced the accused to two years’ imprisonment for each charge under s 377 Penal Code involving fellatio by the victim on the accused there.  Mr Lee sought to persuade me that I should use that sentence as a guide because in 
Pok’s
 case, the acts were consensual as in the case before me whereas in 
Adam’s
 case they were not consensual.
48        Having said that, Mr Lee conceded that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment would not be appropriate in view of the relationship of trust.  He suggested three years’ imprisonment instead and, if three years was too low, he then suggested it should not exceed four years’ per charge under s 377.
49        For the offences under s 377A, Mr Lee submitted that I should be guided by a sentence of nine months which was the sentence eventually imposed in 
Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor
 
[1997] 3 SLR 278
 for an outrage of modesty under s 354 Penal Code.  Mr Lee submitted that the offences under s 377A were akin to offences under s 354 and the prosecution had proceeded under s 377A instead because consent under that provision was not a defence whereas under s 354, it was.
50        As regards the question of consecutive sentences, Mr Lee referred to what Thean JA had said in the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
:
24         Lastly, in this case, having regard to the nature of the offences committed by the appellant, we were of the opinion that the total term of imprisonment of 40 years imposed by the court below, was a crushing sentence and not in proportion to the overall gravity of the criminal conduct of the appellant.  On this point we echo the following observation of Yong Pung How CJ in 
Maideen Pillai v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
 at p 196:
[T]he sentencing court will bear in mind at all times the second limb of the totality principle, that is, the need to avoid an aggregate sentence so harsh as to be ‘crushing’ in its effect on the offender.  Where consecutive sentences are imposed on an offender, the overall punishment should be in proportion to the overall gravity of his criminal conduct, taking into account the circumstances in which he offended and also the pattern of his previous behaviour.
25         In the circumstances, we reduced the term of imprisonment of five years for each of the offences and ordered four of them to run consecutively and the remaining four to run concurrently with the four consecutive terms of five years, thus making in aggregate a total term of 20 years.
51        Mr Lee concluded his submission by saying that the total years of imprisonment should be significantly less than 20 years and submitted that a total sentence of ten to twelve years would serve the ends of justice and would be a sufficient deterrent.  Anything more would be crushing and not in proportion to the overall gravity of the conduct of Lim.
52        On the other hand, Mr Hamid submitted that Lim had abused his position of trust and authority and the trust placed on him by the students’ parents.  In some cases, he was their surrogate parent.  For example, Lim had told Ong’s mother that Ong had to be tutored daily from Monday to Sunday and because of the time taken to travel to and fro, Ong eventually stayed at Lim’s flat with Ong’s mother visiting Ong twice a week.  Likewise Hong also eventually stayed at Lim’s flat.
53        Mr Hamid also submitted that Lim’s use of corporal punishment and veiled threats to kick the victims out of the tuition group enhanced his influence over them.
54        Mr Hamid submitted that the fact that the victims feared, trusted and respected Lim obviated the need for Lim to resort to violence, overt threats and trickery.  Lim had subtly manipulated the victims to do what he wanted them to do and what Lim had done was to corrupt his victims morally.  Lim was merely giving excuses when he had alleged that he was trying to “educate” the victims and make them “more open minded”.  This was Lim’s way of getting his victims to engage in his perversions.
55        Mr Hamid submitted that Lim knew his own perverse inclination but did not seek treatment.  He submitted that Lim was a danger to young boys and the numerous charges were evidence of a repeated pattern of behaviour.  He also pointed out that even Dr Tian’s report recognised the risk of recidivism and that is why Dr Tian had said that if there was proper therapy, the risk of recidivism can be significantly reduced.
56        Mr Hamid relied on, inter alia, 
Donald Walters
 [1994] 15 Cr App R(S) 690 in which Judge J, in the Court of Appeal, said:
Mr Jenkins has carefully drawn our attention to the significance of this man’s age and his positive good character, the effect of any prison sentence on him, the damage to his family, the loss of his own reputation within his community and, indeed, the financial consequences of the conviction.  Our attention has been drawn to the delay and strain, and to the fact that the last incident of which the appellant was convicted occurred as long ago as 1984.
We have considered those matters, as the learned judge did.  They have to be taken into account, but at the end of the day this remains a case in which a man of very mature years in a position of trust systematically abused that trust in a most disgraceful, persistent and damaging way, targeting vunerable [
sic
] girls who, for various reasons, he believed would be unlikely to report his conduct.
The sentence to be passed had to reflect public abhorrence of behaviour of this kind.  Without the benefit of a plea of guilty, a sentence of four years’ imprisonment was appropriate.
57        I was of the view that although the facts in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
 were different from those before me, certain statements by Chief Justice Yong Pung How were also apposite.
58        At paras 21, 25(1) and 34, Yong CJ said:
21         In considering the appropriate tariffs for sentences, the gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed had to be taken into account.
Gravity of the offence
(1)        
Harm to the victims.
  The harm to the victims includes both the physical and the emotional harm. … The long-term emotional harm and psychological scars to the victims cannot be underestimated, though there has been caution in 
R v Willis
 (1974) 60 Cr App R 146 that the court should not readily assume that the victims will later develop homosexuality in life because they have been sexually abused when young.  Much will also depend on the support the victims receive from their families.
(2)        
Social danger
.  Paedophilic offences are by their nature unpleasant and most distressing and the society has to express its marked disapproval for such harm to the young and vulnerable victims.  The presumption is that the safety of the child must be paramount and chronic paedophiles who have a propensity to re-offend, because they are either totally unable or unwilling to control themselves, have to be put away for long periods.
…
25         We considered the relevant circumstances of the offence in placing a particular offence according to its relative gravity.
Circumstances in which the offences are committed:
(1)        
Abuse of trust and authority
.  Where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence.  All those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual urges.
…
34         In our judgment the learned judge’s observation that ‘though pleading guilty must be given effect to in determining sentence, it must depend on the facts of each and every case’ is perfectly proper and correct.  For example, in a rape case, where the trauma of the victim having to recount the rape in evidence is saved, a plea of guilty might be considered as justifying an appropriate discount to the sentence that might have been passed after a trial.  But there is always the public interest to be considered.
59        In relation to the specific charges, Mr Hamid said that in the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
, the Court of Appeal had suggested that a court should start off with five years’ imprisonment for acts of fellatio on the victim.  As the offences included acts where Lim received fellatio, Mr Hamid submitted that the sentence for such offences should go beyond five years.  However, Mr Lee pointed out that in the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
, the accused faced 23 charges under s 377 as opposed to the 11 which Lim was facing.
60        On s 377A, Mr Hamid used the case of 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 as a guide and submitted that a sentence of one year’s imprisonment was appropriate.
61        Mr Hamid submitted that the case before me was more aggravating than in the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
 as Lim was in a position of trust and authority.  Calling for a deterrent sentence, Mr Hamid submitted that the aggregate term of imprisonment ought to exceed the 20 years imposed in the case of 
Adam bin Darsin
.
My Decision
62        Lim is an extraordinary person.  Unfortunately, he is extraordinary both in the positive and in the perverse sense.
63        I accepted that the tremendous beneficial influence Lim had had on the lives of many of his students was a strong mitigating factor.
64        On the other hand, Lim was in a position of authority and a relationship of trust.  Lim was trusted by both the parents of the victims and by the victims themselves.  The reason why no physical force was used was because he systematically exploited his position of authority and trust The fact that, generally, his students looked to him as their mentor was, in my view, not a mitigating but an aggravating factor.
65        I also found Lim’s explanation that he was helping the victims to be open-minded when he engaged in the offences, unacceptable.   He had taken advantage of them to satisfy his depraved nature.  The sentence to be passed should reflect public abhorrence of behaviour of this kind in the circumstances of the case.
66        As regards the risk of recidivism, I had considered the reports of Dr Kenneth Koh and Dr Tian Choong Sing.
67        I also noted that Lim had no prior conviction and Mr Lee had informed me that Lim was undergoing treatment.  Furthermore, as Lim had been able to instil discipline in his students, I was of the view that there was a fair chance that he would be able to do likewise for himself so as to refrain from ever abusing male children again, especially since he had become aware of the severity of the punishment for such offences.
68        In the circumstances, I sentenced the accused Lim Beng Cheok as follows:
(a)        On the 43
rd
 charge under s 377A, one year’s imprisonment
(b)        On the 2
nd
 charge under s 377A, one year’s imprisonment
(c)        On the 9

 charge under s 377, six years’ imprisonment
(d)        On the 15

(e)        On the 21

(f)         On the 27

(g)        On the 29
th
 charge under s 377, six years’ imprisonment
(h)        On the 31
st

(i)         On the 39
th
 charge under s 377A, one year’s imprisonment
(j)         On the 34
th
 charge under s 377A, one year’s imprisonment
69        The sentences for the 9
th
 , 27
th
 and 31
st
 charges were to run consecutively from the date of remand i.e 2 August 2002.  The sentences for the remaining seven charges were to run concurrently with the consecutive sentences.  The aggregate term of imprisonment was 18 years.
70        I would add that in the circumstances of the case, the totality of the charges on which Lim was convicted as well as the remaining charges being taken into consideration, I did not think any useful purpose would be served in ordering different sentences for offences of fellatio upon the victim and offences for instructing the victim to perform fellatio on him.",2003-03-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
Kadir bin Awang (the accused) was charged with having imported into Singapore, at about 5.45am on or about 9 October 1986, in a train alongside the Ayer Rajah Expressway, 33 packets of a substance containing not less than 50.61g of diamorphine, without authorization, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
It was the prosecution`s case that the accused had gone to Malaysia with Jamala bte Hashim (Jamala) on 1 October 1986, that the drugs had been purchased by the accused in Penang and that the accused and Jamala had returned to Singapore by train from Johore Bahru early on the morning of 9 October. As the train reached a stretch of the railway line at Lower Delta Road, adjacent to the Ayer Rajah Expressway, the accused had thrown a package containing the drugs out of the train window. The package was retrieved by Yusoff bin Mohd Noor (Yusoff), who had been waiting on or near an overhead bridge. Yusoff took the package to a flat known as Blk 14, #02-288, Telok Blangah Crescent (the flat), where he was joined later by the accused and Jamala.
The prosecution led evidence that on the afternoon of 9 October 1986, senior narcotics officer Jamaludin bin Salleh (SNO Jamaludin) and four officers attached to the enforcement division, Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) set out to raid the flat. At about 5.30pm, SNO Jamaludin and three of his men knocked on the door of the flat; a fourth officer, ANO Lim Tze Chien was stationed on the ground floor, at the rear of Blk 14, in order to keep the window of the flat under observation.
There was no response to repeated knocking on the door. One of the officers peered under it and saw that the flat was occupied. The officers continued knocking, but without result. SNO Jamaludin and one of his officers went to the Radin Mas police post, situated close by, to secure a crowbar, leaving ANOs Riduan bin Mohamed Noor and Lim Tian Siew at the door of the flat.
ANO Riduan climbed onto a stool which he found in the corridor, and broke a plywood panel above the door of the flat. He looked in and saw Kadir bin Awang squatting on the floor, at the end of a bed. ANO Riduan ordered the accused to open the door, which he duly did. ANOs Riduan and Lim Tian Siew entered the one-room, L-shaped flat and saw that it held two other occupants, Jamala and Yusoff. The accused and Yusoff were searched, and nothing in the way of drugs or weapons was found on them.
SNO Jamaludin and NO Ho Thiam Huat, the officer who accompanied him to the police post, returned to the flat shortly afterwards. SNO Jamaludin ordered ANOs Riduan and Ho to conduct a search. ANO Riduan found a quantity of vegetable matter and a rolled-up $1 note on the floor, near a bed. The vegetable matter was later ascertained to be cannabis, and the dollar note was found to be stained with diamorphine
One of the pieces of furniture in the flat was a white cupboard, with a pair of drawers at its foot. ANO Riduan found a set of keys in the cupboard. He asked who owned them, and the accused acknowledged that the keys were his. ANO Riduan then asked to whom the cupboard belonged, and the accused said that it belonged to him. ANO Riduan opened one of the drawers at the foot of the cupboard with a key and found in it a plastic bag and a cigarette carton. The bag contained 20 sachets, and the carton 13 smaller sachets, of a granular substance which, upon later analysis, was found to contain a total of 50.61g of diamorphine.
After the discovery of the drugs and the money in the drawer, the accused, who had been seen squatting, handcuffed to Yusoff, told SNO Jamaludin that he had something to say. The SNO ordered the handcuff to be unsecured and, as he and the accused walked towards the kitchen area of the flat, the accused made a statement (the oral statement) to SNO Jamaludin.
As this evidence emerged, counsel for the accused rose and said that he had no notice of the oral statement and that SNO Jamaludin had made no reference to it in his evidence before the preliminary inquiry. If the accused had made a statement, and if it allegedly amounted to a confession, said counsel, he was objecting to it on the grounds that it was not voluntarily made. The learned DPP responded that the oral statement did not amount to a confession `in regard to this case`. We nevertheless ruled that we would deal with the admissibility of the oral statement in a voir dire in which we would also rule on the admissibility of a statement (`the written statement`) allegedly made later by the accused pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Ed).
During the search of the flat, Jamala`s passport was recovered. It showed that she had entered Malaysia via Johore Bahru on 1 October 1986, and that she had returned to Singapore on 9 October.
At about 6.15pm, the accused, Jamala and Yusoff were escorted to CNB. They arrived there at about 6.30pm and remained in the general office until about 8.40pm when they were both taken to the Singapore General Hospital for medical examinations. The accused was brought back to CNB from his medical examination at about 10.15pm, and at about 10.35pm he was charged, jointly with Jamala in furtherance of the common intention of them both, with having imported 33 packets of diamorphine at about 5.45am that morning at Keppel Road Railway Station without authorization, and in contravention of s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, read with s 34 of the Penal Code.
Little more than six weeks later, namely, on 1 December 1986, Jamala was produced in court. The charge against her was withdrawn, and she, was discharged, her discharge amounting to an acquittal. Shortly after her acquittal she was served with a subpoena to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution at the preliminary inquiry, which was held on 8 July 1987. She duly did so.
She also gave evidence against the accused at the trial before us. Her evidence was crucial to the case for the prosecution.
Jamala said, in her examination-in-chief, that she first met the accused in June 1986, and that her relationship with him became close. She was on drugs and obtained her supply from the accused. On 1 October 1986, she went to Penang with the accused on holiday at his invitation. They lived in a hotel, she thought, for about three days, and on one of those days the accused told her that he was going downstairs, to see a friend. Thereupon, Jamala went to the window of her room, which was adjacent to the accused`s room on the fourth floor of the hotel, from which she could see the hotel carpark below, and beyond it, the street on which the hotel was located.
She saw the accused in the carpark. He took out `a stack of money`, two inches thick, and handed it to his friend, who had driven up in a car, in exchange for a plastic bag. The accused then came up to her room, gave her a `straw` and told her that they would be going to Kuala Lumpur, which they duly did.
In Kuala Lumpur, the accused and Jamala shared the same hotel room. They stayed for about two days, went to Malacca for half a day and then proceeded to Johore Bahru where they checked into a hotel and stayed for about three days in the same room.
On the second of those three days, the accused opened the plastic bag which she had seen him receive in the carpark in Penang. He took from it a parcel wrapped in newspaper, which contained packets of what looked like the drugs she was in the habit of consuming, and which the accused called `smack`. They both consumed some `smack`, after which the accused told Jamala that they would be returning to Singapore the following day. The accused instructed Jamala to repack the drugs. In the course of doing so she counted 33 packets. The accused and Jamala quarrelled because she was afraid and was reluctant to return to Singapore with him. The quarrel continued for some time, during the course of which the accused struck Jamala across the back with a coat-hanger.
In the event, at about 5am the next morning, 9 October 1986, the accused and Jamala proceeded to the railway station in Johore Bahru, Jamala carrying the packages containing the drugs in her suitcase, at the accused`s insistence. Upon the arrival of the Singapore train at about 5.30am, they boarded it after a customs` check, Jamala sitting three rows behind the accused, each occupying a window seat on the right-hand side of an empty carriage.
Following the train`s departure from Johore Bahru, the accused went to Jamala`s seat and asked for the package. She got it out of her suitcase and gave it to him. He then asked her for a plastic bag and she gave him one into which she had packed her shoes. The accused returned to the seat he had been occupying previously, and Jamala saw him place the package in the plastic bag. As the train alongside the Ayer Rajah Expressway approached an overhead bridge at Lower Delta Road, the accused rose, leant out of the window, signalled to someone outside by pointing with his hand and threw the plastic bag, with the package in it, out of the window just as the train passed the overhead bridge. Jamala saw a person standing `near the overhead bridge` to whom the accused had addressed his signal. She saw that it was Yusoff. She also saw Yusoff respond to the accused`s signal by pointing to the spot at which the accused had pointed just before the package was thrown.
The train proceeded to the railway station at Tanjong Pagar. The accused and Jamala alighted and proceeded to the flat by taxi. Yusoff was already there. The accused asked Yusoff whether he had retrieved the package, to which Yusoff replied in the affirmative. At noon the accused gave Jamala the key to the flat and the key to the cupboard, saying that he was going out. Jamala went to sleep and was awakened by the CNB officers knocking at the door. They took possession of Jamala`s passport, but not that of the accused, which they left on the bed. She had seen the accused`s passport on their journey to Penang. It bore the accused`s photograph, but a name which was not his.
Before the conclusion of Jamala`s evidence-in-chief, counsel for the defence applied for an adjournment in order to take instructions on the grounds that Jamala had given a mass of evidence, in particular concerning events which occurred in Malaysia, which had not featured in the story she told at the preliminary inquiry. Counsel`s application was wholly justified and we readily granted an adjournment of a day`s duration.
When the trial resumed, Jamala continued her evidence. She told us that after her discharge on 1 December 1986, the accused`s father offered her $10,000 `not to go to court`; that at or about the same time, she was assaulted by three young Chinese who called out her name, asked her if she knew the accused, and beat her up; and, that a week before the trial commenced, she was accosted at Telok Blangah Market by the accused`s younger brother, Jamil, and told that if she gave evidence `and anything happened` to the accused, she would suffer the same fate.
 The voire dire
Counsel objected to the admissibility of the alleged oral and written statements on grounds which boiled down to the following: 
 
 
(i) that the accused made no oral statement; 
 
(ii) alternatively, if he did make an oral statement, it was not made voluntarily in that the accused was assaulted by SNO Jamaludin and ANO Lim Tze Chien, shortly after the SNO entered the flat upon his return from Radin Mas; 
 
(iii) the accused made no written statement, SNO Jamaludin having been the author of a written statement signed by the accused; 
 
(iv) alternatively, if the accused did make a written statement:
 
(a) ) it was not recorded in compliance with the provisions of s 122(6); and 
 
(b) ) immediately prior to the recording of the written statement, inducements and promises were offered to the accused while he was seated at SNO Jamaludin`s table; and 
 
(v) that even if there was no threat, promise or inducement leading to the recording of the written statement, the accused`s state of mind, as a result of the consumption of drugs, was such that we should exercise our discretion against the admission of the statement.
  
 
 
As to the alleged assaults, the accused`s evidence was that when SNO Jamaludin entered the flat at about 5pm on 9 October, he was angry. That, we find, is perfectly possible. The occupants of the flat had refused the CNB officers entry for some time and SNO Jamaludin had been obliged to go and obtain a crowbar at Radin Mas police post. When he returned he found that two of his officers had already been let in. It is therefore conceivable that he was not in a particularly agreeable frame of mind. However, we did not believe that virtually his first action upon entering the flat was to strike the accused two or three blows in the stomach. As for the slaps and push alleged to have been delivered by ANO Lim Tze Chien, we found that he was the officer who was posted to the rear of the building, on the ground floor and that when SNO Jamaludin entered the flat, ANO Lim was still at that post and could not have assaulted the accused.
We are bound to state that although ANO Lim Tze Chien was present in court, as were SNO Jamaludin`s other officers, neither ANO Lim Tze Chien (who was identified by the accused as the officer who slapped and pushed him) nor those other officers were called as witnesses in the voir dire to rebut the accused`s allegations. This was an imprudent decision on the part of the learned DPP, and in so saying we have in mind the judgments of the Federal Court in 
 Tan Too Kia v PP 
 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 187
  and that of Choor Singh J in 
 PP v lbrahim bin Mastari 
 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 188
  reported in the same volume at p 188. However, these cases do not say that the failure to call a witness in rebuttal at a voire dire is fatal to the admission of a statement. In our view, such an omission simply imposes upon the court a duty to scrutinize the evidence as to voluntariness with very special care. This we did. We also bore in mind the evidence of Jamala, who gave her evidence before the voir dire. She said that she did not see SNO Jamaludin assault the accused upon entering the flat, and we believed her.
After the accused, Jamala and Yusoff were escorted to CNB from the flat, they remained in the general office for some two hours before being taken to the Singapore General Hospital for their respective medical examinations. There was no criticism of the treatment the accused received during this period, and he conceded that he was not threatened in any way, nor was he the recipient of any promise or inducement.
Dr John Richard Isaac, who carried out examinations of the accused both before and after the written voir dire, but gave evidence earlier. He did not bring his clinical notes to court, but Dr Isaac said that he found no sign of injury on the accused, and that the accused did not complain of any assault. Although Dr Isaac conceded that he would only have observed bruises if the accused was struck heavy blows, we were satisfied from our observation of the accused and our assessment of him when he gave evidence in the voir dire, that he would have said so to Dr Isaac in the plainest of terms had he been assaulted earlier in the day.
In the result, our unreserved conclusion was that the accused`s account of the alleged assaults in the flat at the hands of SNO Jamaludin and ANO Lim Tze Chien was untrue. We found that the accused was not assaulted and therefore had no reason to fear further assault.
It was asserted by the accused that in the twenty minutes or so between the time he was brought back from his medical examination and the time he began making his written statement, he was seated at SNO Jamaludin`s desk and that he received certain inducements and promises, as well as being taunted by having a sachet of diamorphine dangled in front of him. SNO Jamaludin`s evidence was that at that time he was engaged in sorting out and marking the exhibits in the case and that he offered no blandishments of any kind to the accused. We believed the SNO`s version of what took place and rejected the accused`s account of what transpired during the period in question.
In so far as it was alleged that the written statement was not recorded in compliance with s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), a careful assessment of the evidence drove us to the conclusion that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the requirements of the section were complied with. We were satisfied that both the charge and the warning were interpreted and explained to the accused, and we were particularly impressed with the evidence of the interpreter, Abdul Razak, in these respects. The accused`s evidence was that SNO Jamaludin was the author of the statement; that none of it fell from the lips of the accused; that he had signed the paper (P14) bearing the handwritten charge, the warning, and the acknowledgements four times in one fell swoop, at the behest of SNO Jamaludin because he was fed up and wished to be taken down to the lock-up. We regarded this account as outlandish, and we disbelieved it, preferring the evidence of SNO Jamaludin and Abdul Razak.
As for the submission that we should exercise our discretion and keep the written statement out on the grounds that the accused was not in a fit state to make it due to the effects of drug consumption, Dr Isaac said that the accused had seemed well and alert. He did not observe withdrawal symptoms, and when asked if he had any complaints, the accused had answered in the negative. If the accused had exhibited withdrawal symptoms, said Dr Isaac, he would have seen them and recorded the fact in his report.
The accused`s objections to the admissibility of the oral and written statements failed. We concluded that the accused had made both the oral and written statements, and that he had made them voluntarily. We ruled that both statements be admitted into evidence.
 The resumed trial
SNO Jamaludin gave evidence that the oral statement, made to him by the accused in the flat just after 6 pm on 9 October 1986, was in the following terms: 
 
`Lia` (Jamala) has got nothing to do with the case. I was the one who brought the thing in from Penang. Let her go because she just accompanied me.
 
 
 
The written statement, which was recorded some four and a half hours later went as follows: 
 
On 1 October 1986, I left for Penang with Jamala. After two days there, I bought 20 sachets of heroin and 13 mini-sachets of heroin for Malaysian dollars $5,400. I returned to Singapore by train this morning at about 5.45am. I went home with Jamala and kept the heroin in my cupboard drawer. Later in the evening, CNB officers raided my home and arrested me together with the drugs. All the drugs were meant for my consumption. I plead for leniency.
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the admission of the statements in evidence, counsel for the accused requested that Dr Isaac be recalled, since counsel wished to address the issue of the probative value of the statements. Dr Isaac was duly produced for cross-examination by counsel. This time he brought copies of his clinical notes with him. At the time he examined the accused, Dr Isaac had been qualified for four years, and had been attached at various times to Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and National University Hospital. He had performed duties as a medical officer with general medical, as opposed to specialist, training.
Dr Isaac thought that the prestatement examination of the accused would have taken him about ten minutes. There was no request on the part of CNB for the accused to be examined for the effect of drugs, although the form which had accompanied the accused stated that he had been involved in a trafficking offence. Dr Isaac said that in the case of a habitual heavy user, he would expect withdrawal symptoms to begin to appear between five and ten hours after consumption, and that the symptoms would be at their worst between 24 and 48 hours after consumption. Dr Isaac detected no withdrawal symptoms, but he conceded that he might have looked more carefully if he had noticed that the accused was an abuser. He did not look for these symptoms as a matter of routine, but such symptoms are very overt. He would have observed them if they were present, and he would have noted them down.
Dr Isaac said that withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, hostility, disorientation, sweatiness, abdominal pains, muscle aches, vomiting and nausea. He was honest enough to say that he could not state what symptoms would be exhibited at the onset of withdrawal, that is to say during the period between five and ten hours after consumption, because of his lack of experience of this type of problem, and because symptoms during onset are more subtle. Although the accused appeared alert and his general condition was good, Dr Isaac conceded that a patient who has taken drugs can appear perfectly lucid. The accused`s nasal passages had appeared to be `a bit wet`. Dr Isaac agreed that a running nose is one of the symptoms of withdrawal.
In answer to a question from the court, Dr Isaac expressed the view that having regard to his observation of the accused during the prestatement examination, a statement made by the accused immediately thereafter would have been reliable, in the sense that it was not likely to have been affected by the consumption of drugs.
Some six or seven days into the trial, we were told by the learned DPP that Yusoff (who, on the case for the prosecution, had recovered the package containing the drugs and taken it back to the flat) would not be called as a prosecution witness because he had declined to give evidence. This came as no surprise since Yusoff had not been a witness at the preliminary inquiry. The DPP informed us that Yusoff, although not in court, would be offered as a witness to the defence. We directed that Yusoff be traced and brought to court, so that he might be interviewed by counsel for the defence.
Two days later, we were told that Yusoff had been seen by SNO Jamaludin the previous day, and that he had `promised` to turn up in court but had failed to do so. No attempt had been made to serve him with a subpoena. The DPP was directed to effect service of a subpoena on Yusoff to the intent that he be produced in court on 30 January so that counsel for the defence might interview him.
At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel submitted that the accused should not be called upon to make his defence. He submitted that, on the prosecution`s own case, it was Jamala who had imported the drugs into Singapore, not the accused; her evidence was incredible and was radically different from the evidence she had given at the preliminary inquiry; the prosecution had neither called nor made available the witness Yusoff, a vital link in the prosecution case; and the prosecution had in any event failed to prove that the drugs found in the flat were the drugs that Jamala had imported.
We rejected counsel`s submission. There was evidence, which was not inherently incredible, and which if accurate, established that Jamala had carried the drugs onto the train at Johore Bahru as the accused`s agent and/or under duress applied by him; that once the train was in Singapore the drugs were taken by the accused from Jamala, and thrown out of the train at Lower Delta; and that those drugs were retrieved by Yusoff and taken to the flat, where they were seized by the CNB officers. We were of the view that the 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  test was satisfied, and called upon the accused to make his defence to the charge.
The accused, who is 42, gave evidence on his own behalf. He told us that he began taking drugs in 1977, and was arrested for the first time in 1978. He was confined at DRC for three periods, the last of which ended in May or June 1985, at which time he was placed on the `day release scheme`. This scheme enabled him to work outside the Centre but required him to return at night.
He absconded soon after he was placed on the scheme, after which he had no fixed address. He did not return to the flat in which his wife and two unmarried children lived; nor did he return to his mother`s apartment, opposite the flat, because his mother had told him that CNB officers were looking for him. Between the time he absconded in June/July 1985 and the date of his arrest, 9 October 1986, he took casual jobs as a labourer, slept rough, earned between $200 and $300 a week, and spent the greater part of it on heroin, ganja, a drug called `Heromin 5` (which he used to reduce withdrawal symptoms), and beer.
On 8 October 1986, the accused had received $300 as wages for working as a stevedore for four or five days on board a Japanese vessel, which was moored at the Quarantine Anchorage. He had been employed by a Chinese contractor, whose name he could not remember. He did not know the name of the vessel. He had eaten and slept on board, having been taken to the vessel by bumboat from Clifford Pier. His work on board ended on 8 October.
The accused remembered waking up at about 7am on the morning of 9 October 1986. He found himself at the Esplanade. He had consumed `smack` and ganja the previous night, after returning ashore from his job on the ship, and had also drunk beer, becoming very `high`. He described himself, in English, as having been in a state of `havoc`. He could not recall how he had got to the Esplanade, but having awaken at 7am he washed his face at a public toilet, and had a cup of coffee at a stall in the Satay Club. He then took a bus to a construction site at Palmer Road, with a view to finding work.
There was no work available. He went to a canteen at the worksite, and fell in with a group of Thai, Malaysian and Bangladeshi labourers who were gambling at cards. The accused told us that he is a lucky gambler, and with the $100 or so that was left after his binge the previous night, he bought a couple of sticks of ganja, and won over $1,000, gambling between 9am and 2pm. He decided to go to his mother`s apartment at Telok Blangah Crescent in order to give her some money.
When he got there, the door to his mother`s apartment was ajar, and he could see relatives from Segamat inside. He turned on his heels, walked a few steps across the corridor to the flat and knocked on the door. It was opened by Yusoff, who let him in.
Upon entering the flat, he saw Jamala. This was only the second time that he had laid eyes on her, the first having been in or about June/July 1986. The accused sat on the floor with Yusoff and Jamala, and they took heroin together, using a rolled up $1 note to `chase the dragon`. Later, there was knocking at the door. The accused let in two CNB officers after the panel above the door had been broken. Later SNO Jamaludin had entered, armed with a crowbar. He approached the accused, who was squatting, hauled him up by his right arm and struck him two or three blows in the stomach, saying, `Why did you not open the door earlier?` At the same time, SNO Lim Tze Chien slapped him across the back a couple of times and pushed him.
The CNB officers searched the flat. They seized the diamorphine from the drawer, and the rolled up $1 note and some ganja off the floor. Before ANO Riduan searched the cupboard, he did not ask who owned the keys he found, or whose cupboard it was. The accused made no oral statement to SNO Jamaludin and he was not asked for his passport. He did not have an identity card, let alone a passport.
Jamala, Yusoff and the accused were escorted out of the flat, in that order. In the corridor, the accused shouted for his mother three or four times, and when she appeared he tossed his wallet containing his morning`s winnings to her, since after all he had come to visit her in the first place in order to give her money. The wallet landed on the floor. As the accused`s mother was about to pick it up, SNO Jamaludin pushed her aside, and retrieved it with his left hand. When the accused`s mother tried to take it from him, he took it from his left hand into his right hand, and held it out of her reach, pushing her away. SNO Jamaludin, his escorts and their prisoners then went on their way to CNB.
As for his relationship with Yusoff, the accused said that they had first met as inmates of DRC in 1981. There had been two casual meetings in 1983. In March 1986, the accused had gone to visit his mother and saw Yusoff, dressed in a sarong, outside the flat. They had exchanged greetings, and ended up consuming `smack` in the flat, Yusoff having let the accused in.
In a nutshell, the accused had not gone to Penang with Jamala on 1 October 1986 and therefore had not returned with her on 9 October. Jamala`s evidence was a total fabrication. The drugs in the flat did not belong to him; nor did the other items, such as a camera and video tapes, that were found in the same drawer as the diamorphine.
The accused called no witnesses. Counsel for the defence was eventually able to interview Yusoff, and decided not to use him.
The accused`s defence was, essentially, alibi. Despite this, no notice was given on his behalf in accordance with the provisions of s 155 of the Penal Code. However, the DPP took no issue over the absence of the prescribed notice, and we allowed the accused to give evidence in support of his alibi. At the end of the defence case we allowed the DPP to call two witnesses by way of rebuttal of the alibi evidence. Cpt Chua Eng Kiat (PW13) told us that he knew of no instance in his eight years as OC Enforcement, at the Port Master`s Department, of a vessel having worked cargo for up to four or five days in any of the port`s three Immigration and Quarantine Anchorages. A vessel may be worked in these anchorages only if specific permission is granted, and permission is generally granted for a few hours, and then only in exceptional circumstances. The Immigration and Quarantine Anchorages are separated from working anchorages by buoys.
Abdul Rahim bin Mohamed Don (PW14), an assistant public health inspector, said that he has been responsible for public health in the Satay Club area in Empress Place since November 1987. At any rate, during the period since he assumed this responsibility, stalls have opened at 3pm and have stayed open until midnight. No stalls have opened for business as early as 7am.
Following the conclusion of the closing submissions, we considered the evidence. There were certain features of the prosecution case, which we noted, and of which we took careful account. They were: 
 
 
(i) despite the fact that Jamala`s passport was recovered from the flat, and that at or about the same time the accused told SNO Jamaludin that he had brought the drugs into Singapore from Malaysia that morning, the accused was not asked for the passport he had used, no passport was recovered, and there was no evidence that the accused had disposed of a passport following his return to Singapore. Jamala said that she saw the accused`s passport lying on a bed in the flat after she and the accused had returned, but no member of the raiding party saw it; SNO Jamaludin made no inquiries as to whether a passport had ever been issued to the accused or, if one was issued, whether it had ever been confiscated on any one of the three occasions when the accused was sent to the DRC; 
 
(ii) SNO Jamaludin returned to the flat after escorting the accused, Jamala and Yusoff to CNB. He did so to supervise the taking of photographs and, according to him, to search for the accused`s passport. He had said nothing about a search for the passport at the preliminary inquiry, and ANO Lim Thian Siew, who accompanied him on this visit to the flat, said that there was no search; 
 
(iii) Jamala could not remember the name of any one of the four hotels she and the accused had checked into in Malaysia, despite the fact that they had stayed in Penang for (as it emerged) at least four days, and in Johore for three; 
 
(iv) although they had gone to Penang for a holiday, Jamala spent the best part of her time there in her hotel room, or that of the accused; 
 
(v) Jamala said that the accused chose to take possession of, and pay for, the drugs in the carpark of the hotel in Penang in broad daylight, in public view, without even bothering to get into the car in which the accused`s friend had driven up; 
 
(vi) Jamala was for some reason drawn to the hotel window on the fourth floor at which she remained for some 25 minutes, and from which she was able to observe the two-inch thick stack of notes which the accused passed to his friend in exchange for the bag containing the drugs; 
 
(vii) despite the fact of having visited johore Bahru between 40 and 50 occasions in the 15 or so months before October 1986, Jamala was not only unable to name the hotel in that town in which she and the accused stayed, but was also unable to state its location; 
 
(viii) Jamala was unable to give any explanation, or at any rate any explanation that convinced us, for her numerous previous visits to Johore Bahru, bearing in mind that she neither worked nor lived there; 
 
(ix) since Jamala could not have expected the accused to throw the package out of the train window, and bearing in mind the speed at which the train was travelling, the darkness of the hour and the nature of the lighting on the overhead bridge, Jamala was able to observe with great clarity not only the accused`s actions, but Yusoff standing in the vicinity of the overhead bridge and responding to the accused`s gestures; 
 
(x) although Jamala had been afraid of returning to Singapore with the accused when she realized that he had purchased drugs in Penang, and sought to distance herself from him on the train, she readily returned to the flat with him, making no effort to go back to her parents` home close by; and 
 
(xi) no suitcase was found in the flat; and no evidence was led as to who, if anyone, paid rent for the flat after its registered occupant died in 1984; 
 
(xii) although, on the prosecution case, Yusoff was prima facie an abettor of the offence with which the accused was charged, SNO Jamaludin chose not to charge him and sent him to DRC on the day following his arrest; 
 
(xiii) a DPP decided to withdraw the charge against Jamala. He gave no reason to SNO Jamaludin for his decision to do so, and following her acquittal she gave evidence for the prosecution at the preliminary inquiry and at the trial; 
 
(xiv) Jamala`s allegations that the accused`s father attempted to bribe her; that she was assaulted by the young Chinese men; and that she was threatened by the accused`s younger brother were never investigated; and 
 
(xv) SNO Jamaludin did not carry out any investigations in Malaysia with a view to ascertaining whether the accused had been in that country between 1 October and 9 October 1986.
  
 
 
In assessing the accused`s credibility, we put out of our minds that he is an acknowledged drug abuser, and has been for a decade or more. There were a number of crucial parts of his evidence which we disbelieved, and rejected. We did not believe that, after absconding from the day release scheme in June/July 1985, the accused did not visit the flat until March 1986, and that he did so on that occasion because he was invited in by Yusoff. Yusoff, according to the accused, was a man he first met at the DRC in 1981. He had seen him on two further occasions in or about 1983. It was incredible that this casual acquaintance should have suddenly turned up at the flat, opposite the apartment of the accused`s parents, wearing a sarong and to all the world the occupant of the flat. We also rejected the accused`s evidence that, from the time he absconded he slept rough, wherever he could, washing himself at public toilets, and hardly ever changing his clothes, when the flat opposite his parents` had fallen vacant in 1984, its registered occupant having died. Immediately after the accused`s arrest, SNO Jamaludin had handed the keys of the flat to the accused`s stepfather, with certain other items found in the flat, and the latter had accepted them.
We found as a fact that the accused had access to and made use of the flat, and we accepted the evidence of ANO Riduan that the accused acknowledged to him that he was the owner of the cupboard, and the keys to the drawers. In his effort to dissociate himself from ownership of this piece of furniture and its contents, the accused denied that the money recovered by SNO Jamaludin was found in the drawer, and asserted that the money was taken from the wallet he threw to his mother in the corridor as he was led away. However, neither the accused`s mother, nor any other witness, was called to support the accused`s evidence of the alleged incident in the corridor. We also took into account the evidence of Jamala, which we believed, that some time after she and the accused returned to the flat on 9 October, the accused left the flat for a period, leaving the keys to the flat and to the cupboard with her.
We disbelieved the accused`s account of the alleged assaults in the flat, and having regard to the medical evidence, we did not accept that the accused`s faculties were impaired by the consumption of drugs, to the extent that his oral and written statements could be said to have been of little or no probative value. Dr Isaac acknowledged that he was not an expert in the field of drug abuse, but he was confident that had the accused exhibited any of the symptoms of withdrawal, he would have observed and made a note of them. Although slightly wet nasal passages could be a symptom of the onset of withdrawal, the accused had complained of flu at the post-statement examination, and the doctor had apparently prescribed Panadol. Dr Isaac`s opinion was that the accused was not exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. The accused was alert and lucid, and we accepted the doctor`s evidence that a statement made by the accused at about the time the examinations were carried out would have been reliable to the extent that it would not have been affected by earlier consumption by the accused of drugs.
Counsel for the accused criticized the failure of the prosecution to call Yusoff. He submitted that this left a serious gap in the prosecution case. It was not enough that Yusoff was offered as a witness to the defence, and an adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that Yusoff was not called as a witness for the prosecution, the defence being under no obligation to call him as their witness. Counsel relied on 
 Abdullah Zawawi v PP 
 
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 16
 . In our view, that case is distinguishable, the prosecution there having failed to call the only witness capable of explaining certain crucial facts. Salleh Abas LP, delivering the judgment of the Federal Court, said: 
 
The practice of making available a witness or witnesses from whom statements have been taken is to prevent the defence from commenting upon the honesty of the prosecution and thus invoking the often quoted presumption of adverse inference unders 114 (g) of the Evidence Act. But where the prosecution evidence falls short of proving a prima facie case at the end of its case, the right not to call such witnesses and to make him/them available to the defence will be of no avail. If the doubt consists of the gap arising out of the matters adumbrated earlier, the prosecution must close this gap. It is not for the defence to call the offered witness/ witnesses to supplement the prosecution case.
 
 
 
The case before us is different. The essential elements of the offence were capable of being, and were, established without the need to call Yusoff. Jamala`s evidence was that she packed the 33 sachets, which were not all the same size, and which the accused had purchased in Penang. She carried them onto the train in a plastic bag at his request, and after the train had entered Singapore, the accused threw the package out of the train to the waiting Yusoff. Jamala heard Yusoff confirm in the flat that he had retrieved the package, and later that afternoon 33 sachets, 20 large and 13 smaller, contained in a plastic bag, were recovered from the flat, to which the accused had access, in a drawer to which he held the key. The contents of the sachets contained not less than 50.61g of diamorphine. That evidence was not inherently incredible and, if accepted as accurate, established the essential elements of the offence at the end of the prosecution case. Yusoff`s evidence was not crucial, and the decision not to call him, and to offer him to the defence, did not amount to a failure on the part of the prosecution to discharge the onus of proof which lay upon it.
We disbelieved the accused`s alibi. It was unsupported by any independent evidence, and the accused was wholly unconvincing in his account of it. Furthermore, the alibi had to be balanced against Jamala`s evidence. Her cross-examination, and the questioning of her by us, occupied the better part of three days. Jamala was 21 years old at the time of her arrest. She is about 23 now. In our assessment, she is intelligent and shrewd. We regarded her as an accomplice and we considered her evidence with much circumspection. We took into account that a great deal of crucial evidence she gave at the trial did not form part of her evidence at the preliminary inquiry.
We also drew the inference that the charge against Jamala had been dropped so that she would be free to give evidence against the accused, in all likelihood because the CNB had failed to recover the passport used by the accused which, together with his oral and written statements, would have been enough to form the basis of a prosecution.
In the course of giving evidence, Jamala sought to sanitize her character and distance herself from the offence. She fudged her evidence about the hotels at which she stayed in Malaysia between 1 October and 9 October and became amnesiac about the reasons for her numerous visits to that country in the 15 months or so prior to October 1986. We nevertheless found that when Jamala went to Malaysia on 1 October 1986, she was accompanied by the accused, who travelled on a false passport. Putting it at its lowest, we found that Jamala was aware of the purchase by the accused of the drugs in Penang, and witnessed the transaction at much closer quarters than she was prepared to admit. We concluded that she carried the package containing the drugs onto the train at Johore Bahru by arrangement with the accused, in furtherance of the common intention of them both to import the drugs into Singapore. We believed that she witnessed the package being thrown out of the train by the accused, to the waiting Yusoff, that Yusoff retrieved it and took it to the flat, and that its contents were seized by the CNB officers when they carried out the raid.
We have indicated areas in the prosecution case which gave us pause, lest it be said that we failed to take account of them, but having regard to the evidence as whole, in particular Jamala`s evidence in so far as it bore on the importation of the drugs, the accused`s voluntary oral and written statements, and our assessment of the accused`s credibility, we were satisfied of the accused`s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. We convict him as charged.

This is an appeal against sentence. The appellant was convicted by the learned district judge on a charge under s 406 of the Penal Code for criminal breach of trust (CBT). He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years which was ordered to take effect from the expiry of the present eight-year term of imprisonment which he is now serving on his earlier conviction in October 1986 of 36 forgery charges.
Counsel for the appellant raised two main grounds of appeal: 
 
 
(i) the sentence of two years` imprisonment is manifestly excessive; and 
 
(ii) the learned district judge did not exercise his discretion judiciously when he ordered that the present sentence of two years should only begin to run after the expiry of his current eight-year term.
  
 
 
Under the first ground, it was argued by counsel for the appellant that the learned district judge erred in taking into consideration the background facts set out in the statement of facts. Counsel contended that those facts related to the charges concerning the forward contracts and those charges had been withdrawn by the prosecution. Counsel also complained that the district judge was wrong to assume that the reduction of the present charge (from one under s 409 to that of a simple CBT under s 406) was due in part to the fact that he had made full restitution and settlement of all outstanding matters with Pan-El and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Counsel further argued that the district judge was not justified in imposing a deterrent sentence.
The present charge is that the appellant dishonestly disposed of $260,000 of the Orchard Hotel Pte Ltd (OHPL) in violation of s 157(1) of the Companies Act to enable one Teo Hock Seng to settle his outstanding debts with the Associated Asian Securities Pte Ltd (AAS), a stockbroking company in which the appellant was a director and a major shareholder. At the time of the offence the appellant was the chairman of OHPL and Teo Hock Seng was the general manager of the hotel. Previously the appellant was a remisier at AAS.
The statement of facts, which was admitted by the appellant, clearly described how the appellant acquired a controlling interest in the Pan-El and Growth Industrial Holdings Ltd (GIH) groups of companies. The statement also went on to elaborate how the appellant used the funds of Pan-El and GIH to finance the clients of AAS. This was done by way of forward contracts. But there was nothing in the statement to link the present charge with either the 36 forgery charges upon which the appellant has been convicted and sentenced or the forward contracts arrangements indulged in by the appellant. What the statement disclosed was that there was a great deal of controversy between the appellant and Teo as to whether Teo in fact owed AAS the sums claimed. But on the charge as framed, it was clearly based on the assumption that the sum $260,000 was used to pay the debts owed by Teo to AAS.
From the first two paragraphs of the grounds of decision of the learned district judge it is clear that he had allowed the other events surrounding the Pan-El and GIH affairs, particularly the arrangements regarding the forward contracts, to affect his decision as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. As I said, there was nothing in the statement that can reasonably be read to suggest that this charge had anything to do with the forgery charges or the forward contracts arrangements (in respect of which matters the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the prosecution). It seems to me that the district judge was influenced by matters unrelated to the present charge when he passed sentence.
Equally clear from the grounds of decision of the learned district judge was that in imposing a sentence of two years` imprisonment, he was imposing a deterrent sentence. His reasons were these: 
 
You held a position of trust and in that position you were able to and you did misuse the funds of the company. Public interest demands that a case like this be dealt with strictly in the hope that would-be offenders will be deterred.
 
 
 
Obviously in every case where a person is charged under s 406, there is an abuse of a position of trust. What makes this case special is that, like the 36 forgery charges, it was uncovered during the investigations into the Pan-El debacle. The charges relating to the deals on forward contracts had been withdrawn. I do not think anything adverse to the appellant can or should be drawn from that fact. It is also clear to me that there was no link between this charge and the 36 forgery charges. Even assuming that there was such a link, the appellant is already now serving a deterrent sentence totalling eight years for the forgery offences (see judgment of FA Chua J in 
 Peter Tham Wing Fai v PP 
 
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 424
  at p 434 who affirmed the deterrent sentence imposed by the senior district judge). I am inclined to agree with counsel for the appellant that to impose another deterrent sentence now on this charge would tantamount to making the appellant suffer double deterrent sentences arising out of basically the same matrix of facts relating to the appellant`s stockbroking business.
In 
 Tan Koon Swan v PP 
 
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
  the Court of Appeal laid down the principles that govern an appellate court in considering an appeal on sentence. It held that an appellate court should interfere if it is satisfied that (i) the sentencing judge has made the wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence; (ii) there has been an error on the part of the trial judge in appreciating the materials placed before him; (iii) the sentence was wrong in principle; or (iv) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
In my view the learned district judge was wrong in taking into account materials which, though placed before him, had nothing to do with the charge. It seems to me that he had decided to impose a deterrent sentence because of factors extraneous to the charge.
There were good mitigating factors in this case, ie full restitution was made to OHPL; appellant had pleaded guilty to the charge; prosecution`s costs had been paid; and a full and final settlement of all outstanding matters with Pan-El and its subsidiaries and affiliates had also been effected. Further, I note that the prosecution did not press for a deterrent sentence but left it to the court. In this regard I was reminded of the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in Brunei in 
 Khoo Ban Hock v PP 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 22
  that the discount for a plea of guilt should be substantial. Considering all these, I am of the view that a sentence of two years` imprisonment in the circumstances of the present case is manifestly excessive though I am also of the opinion that a fine would be quite inadequate. A custodial sentence is called for. I would accordingly reduce the prison term from two years` to one year.
Turning to the second ground of appeal, ie that the present term of imprisonment should run from the date of conviction rather than from the expiry of the eight-year imprisonment term which the appellant is now serving, s 234 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that: 
 
When a person who ... is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced to imprisonment the latter sentence of imprisonment shall commence either immediately or at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced as the court awarding the sentence directs.
 
 
 
This section clearly gives a discretion to the court. Of course, this discretion should be exercised judiciously.
In determining this question, counsel for the appellant urged me to place myself in the shoes of the senior district judge and consider whether, if this charge were dealt together with the earlier 36 charges on forgery, would the senior district judge have imposed this sentence to run consecutive to the eight-year term. Having regard to all the circumstances as a whole, I am satisfied that there is more than an even chance that the senior district judge might, considering the reasons which he gave when sentencing the appellant to the eight-year term, very well have ordered that this sentence should run consecutive to the eight-year term. The case 
 Elsie Florence Carey Albert Ames 
 (1988) 26 Cr App R 133 is clearly distinguishable. There the subsequent charge was similar to the earlier charge which is not so in our present case. In any event, looking at the facts of this case as well as those relating to the 36 forgery charges, I do not think it was wrong of the learned district judge to order that the present term should only take effect after the expiry of the eight-year term. Accordingly, I would not disturb the exercise of the district judge`s discretion.
In the result this appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence is reduced to one-year imprisonment. As ordered by the learned district judge, it shall take effect after the appellant has served his present term.
 Order accordingly.",1989-04-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant was charged with 24 counts of the offence of corruption under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the Act). At the end of a trial which lasted 26 days, the appellant was convicted. He was sentenced to varying periods of imprisonment (from two months to 12 months), with three sentences of 12 months each ordered to run consecutively and the others concurrently with the said three sentences. In other words, he was sentenced to serve a total of three years` imprisonment.
The charges fall into four groups. The first group, consisting of 16 charges, involved one Ling Tian Song of Asiaweld Shipbuilding (Pte) Ltd (Asiaweld Shipbuilding). The second group consisting of five charges involved one Firoz Khan of Aisha (Pte) Ltd. The third group consisting of two charges involved one Cheo Boon Teong. The last charge involved one Haji Moosa. At the material times the appellant was an assistant manager at the Banque Nationale de Paris, Singapore (BNP).
This appeal is against both conviction and sentence on all the 24 charges. Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides that a conviction shall not be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to be wrong in law or is against the weight of the evidence and in the case of a sentence shall not be disturbed unless it is manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
Mr Sherrard, counsel for the appellant, has argued the appeal on the basis of the four groupings identified above. But there is one charge in the first and second groups which requires some special consideration because it involved the receipt by the appellant of a commission on account of the sale of a life policy. One general criticism of Mr Sherrard`s in relation to the decision of the learned district judge on all the charges is that the district judge has failed to carefully weigh the evidence presented to the court. He complained that the grounds of decision are too brief and wholly inadequate and do not address the issues raised by the defence, let alone adequately. He said it is not known which of the evidence of the witnesses the district judge accepted or rejected in whole or in part or why. He argued that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, who had been discredited, was accepted without any good reasons being offered. Even the documentary evidence was far from satisfactory or consistent. Accordingly, he contended that the convictions are against the weight of the evidence. I do not wish at this stage to make any comments on these general remarks of counsel except to say that the fact that the grounds of decision are not as elaborate as the appellant`s counsel would like them to be (22 pages in double spacing in all) does not necessarily mean that the district judge did not carefully consider the evidence presented at the trial. Even Mr Sherrard conceded that a district judge need not and is not expected to deal with every issue or matter raised at the trial. But he argued that the grounds of decision must be able to withstand fair scrutiny and not be deficient as to matters of significance in relation to the issues of fact and/or law arising.
The second general criticism of Mr Sherrard`s is that the district judge has failed to consider the evidence of each charge separately and has allowed cross-infection to take place. He relied on two paragraphs on p 19 of the grounds of decision (p 738 of the record) to say that. But I think the two paragraphs must be viewed in the context. All that the district judge really tried to say there was to disagree with counsel on the value of the documentary evidence. Further, the way in which the district judge went about dealing with all the charges was in line with the manner in which counsel for the appellant made his submission in the court below, ie on the basis of the four groups. The district judge dealt with each group separately. In my opinion there was no question of cross-infection.
The third general point raised by counsel is that this case involved accomplice evidence, and that ordinarily an accomplice is presumed to be unworthy of credit. This point is expressly covered by s 116, illus (b) of the Evidence Act which provides that `the court may presume - (b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution`. Further, s 24 of the Act provides that notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment by him of any gratification to an agent. The application of both these two provisions is for the court to decide on the facts of each case.
Case law has clearly established that on a question of fact the circumstances under which an appellate court may disturb a finding of fact is limited. The Privy Council in the case 
 Caldeira v Gray 
 
 
 [1936] MLJ 137 
 said at p 541: 
 
... their Lordships recognize that they cannot, merely because the question is one of fact, and because it has been decided in one way by the learned district judge, abdicate their duty to review his decision and to reverse it, if they deem it to be wrong. Nonetheless, the functions of a court of appeal, when dealing with a question of fact and a question of fact, moreover, in which, as here, questions of credibility are involved, are limited in their character and scope.
 
 
 
In the later case of 
 Watt v Thomas 
 [1941] AC 484 Lord Thankerton declared the principles thus at pp 487-488: 
 
I do not find it necessary to review the many decisions of this House ... the principle ... may be stated thus:
 
 
 
 
1 Where a question of fact has been tried by a judge without a jury, and there is no question of misdirection of himself by the judge, an appellate court, which is disposed to come to a different conclusion on the printed evidence, should not do so unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the district judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the district judge`s conclusion. 
 
2 The appellate court may take the view that, without having seen or heard the witnesses, it is not in a position to come to any satisfactory conclusion on the printed evidence. 
 
3 The appellate court, either because the reasons given by the district judge are not satisfactory, or because it unmistakeably so appears from the evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matter will then become at large for the appellate court. It is obvious that the value and importance of having seen and heard the witnesses will vary according to the class of case, and, it may be, the individual case in question.
  
 
 
 
 First group of charges
 
Under this group there are 16 charges. Fifteen of them involved sums of money allegedly given by Ling Tian Song, managing director of Asiaweld Shipbuilding (Ling), to the appellant between 23 May 1980 and 5 October 1982, as a reward for his granting overdraft facilities to Asiaweld Shipbuilding in excess of the authorized limit under its account with BNP. The sums given were all by cash cheques, of which on 12 occasions were for the sum of $2,000 and one occasion each for the sums of $2,800, $1,500 and $1,000.
The evidence led by the prosecution consisted mainly of the oral evidence of Ling and certain documentary evidence including the 15 cash cheques and the cheque stubs. Ling said that he gave the moneys to the appellant because of the help which the latter had given his company in relation to the overdraft facilities granted by BNP.
The main points raised by counsel for the appellant against his conviction on the 15 charges are broadly the following: 
 
 
(i) The overdraft which the appellant allowed Ling to draw was in each instance within the discretionary limit granted to the appellant under the general direction given by BNP to its commercial officers. The appellant had not granted overdraft which was beyond his general authority. 
 
(ii) Ling was not able to explain satisfactorily why most often the sum given was for $2,000 and why on three occasions the sums were different. 
 
(iii) Ling`s evidence was that he made monthly payments to the appellant. If so why was it that within a short period in July 1981, and also in June 1982, three sums of $2,000 were given and why on the same day on 12 June 1982 two identical sums of $2,000 were paid. 
 
(iv) The district judge failed to attach significance to the fact that two of the cheques were in fact paid into the account of a limited company, Grand Classics (Pte) Ltd. 
 
(v) The documentary evidence by way of the payment vouchers and the cheque stubs, when viewed together with the cash book and the oral evidence of Yeo Eng Hoon (PW 14), who provided management services to Asiaweld Shipbuilding, was clearly of doubtful veracity. 
 
(vi) Not all the payment vouchers/cheque stubs referred to the appellant. In some instances, there were inconsistencies between the payment vouchers and cheque stubs as to what those payments were for. 
 
(vii) One payment voucher (exh P82) which was for a sum of $2,000 indicated that the sum was paid to `Choo Ling Engineering Works`. 
 
(viii) Ling said that he did not think it was wrong to give money to the appellant; if so, why did he make so many attempts in the cheque stubs and payment vouchers to hide that fact. 
 
(ix) Ling said that through the introduction of the appellant he came to know one Ramesh from whom he got a loan of $200,000 (at 3% interest) in order to reduce Asiaweld Shipbuilding`s overdraft at BNP and, as part of the arrangement to repay Ramesh, he gave ten post-dated cheques each of $26,000 to Ramesh. The evidence showed that only three cheques had been debited against Asiaweld Shipbuilding`s account. Counsel asked what happened to the other seven cheques? Counsel submitted that Ling`s evidence on this loan of $200,000 from Ramesh could not be true and his entire evidence must be viewed with suspicion.
  
 
 
As I have indicated, it is not necessary that a district judge should in his judgment or grounds of decision deal with all the detailed issues that were raised. The district judge has set out the facts on which he relied to hold the appellant guilty of the charges. Ling (PW3), quite clearly said in evidence that he gave, on diverse dates, 15 cash cheques of varying amounts (12 cheques for $2,000, one each for $1,000, $1,500 and $2,800) to the appellant at the latter`s office at BNP. Ling said that the appellant never asked for payment but that he, on his own, gave the sums in question to the appellant as an expression of his appreciation for the assistance which the appellant rendered him with regard to the overdraft facilities extended to Asiaweld Shipbuilding. There was no doubt that Ling was not up to find fault with the appellant. From the evidence of Ling it was clear that the appellant was very helpful to Asiaweld Shipbuilding. Exhibit P 169 showed that excess overdraft was granted by the appellant to Asiaweld Shipbuilding without authorization being obtained in accordance with the procedure laid down by BNP. What the appellant had done, in my view, fell outside the scope of the instructions contained in Information Note No 1149/81 (exh D18).
I do not accept the submission that just because the points raised above are not expressly dealt with in the grounds of decision, it must follow that the decision of the district judge is bad. This court is entitled to and, indeed, must review the evidence to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain the charge and whether on the evidence the criticisms are valid. The fact that the overdraft extended to Asiaweld fell within the global limit of the discretionary power granted by the bank to the appellant as a commercial officer was not the point. The real question was: was Ling allowed to draw from his account even when the account had gone beyond the authorized overdraft limit? On that there was no doubt. The fact that the appellant could have put up the necessary papers to increase the limit was besides the point as he did not do so. Indeed one can be guilty of taking a bribe even if it is not proved that he has shown favour: see 
 R v Carr 
 
[1957] 1 WLR 165
 and s 9 of the Act.
As regards the amounts paid as gratification, Ling said it was based on a percentage of the overdraft drawn and that the percentage did vary. In answer to cross-examination he expressly said that he did not give the same percentage every month. Of course in July 1981, Ling made three payments - the same for June 1982. But one would see that no payment was made in June 1981 and August 1981. Ling also said that one of the payments made in July 1981 was for the appellant`s holiday. This was borne out by the following cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: On 23 May, $2,000; 4 July you gave him $2,000; on 7 July another $2,000. I suggest to you that the first payment in July was probably for June? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The fourth payment of $2,000 was on 21 July but you didn`t pay anything in August? 
 
A: No. One of the cheques given to the accused was for his holiday.
  
 
 
Similarly no payment was made in April 1982 and May 1982. It should therefore not be hard to see why three payments were made in June 1982. I must, however, observe that Ling was not cross-examined on the three cheques given in June 1982. Ling was also not cross-examined on his evidence that two cheques for the sum of $2,000 were given on 12 June 1982. He was not asked to explain. It is too late for the appellant to complain. In any case, I do not see anything incredible about Ling giving two cheques that day.
The fact that two cheques eventually found their way into the account of a limited company, Grand Classics (Pte) Ltd is again neither here nor there. As should be obvious, cash cheques can be credited into any account. I do not find it of any significance that they were paid into the account of Grand Classics. As Ling said he gave the cash cheques to the appellant, it would have been an easy matter for the appellant to have the cheques exchanged with another for cash. None of the cheques had the appellant`s signature on the reverse side of the cheque indicating that he cashed it.
As regards the documentary evidence on the 15 payments, it was true that the documents did not reflect the payments to the appellant in a consistent manner. But that was only to be expected, bearing in mind the nature of such transactions and the fact that they stretched over a long period. If anything at all, it merely showed that Ling had not been very consistent in trying to reflect these payments in his records. Considerable emphasis was placed on the fact that one payment voucher (exh P82) indicated that the sum was paid to `Choo Ling Engineering Works`. A partner of Choo Ling Engineering Works (PW9) said that he was never paid anything more than $300 at a time. He said payments to him were always in dribs and drabs. Ling never said that a sum of $2,000 was paid to Choo Ling Engineering Works. The cheque was of course not given to Choo Ling Engineering Works. What Ling, in effect, said was that that statement in the payment voucher was just a cover up.
Ling said he did not think that it was wrong for him to give money to the appellant. Counsel suggested that the way in which Ling tried not to disclose the name of the appellant on the cheque stubs and the payment vouchers indicated otherwise. Ling explained, `I don`t want it to be shown in the account he had taken too much money.` He admitted that it was embarrassing. In my view there is nothing here which really discredited Ling: his explanation seems reasonable enough. In any event I do not think this point is so material as to affect his evidence generally as the district judge had found him to be a witness of truth.
Then there was the evidence relating to the loan of $200,000 from one Ramesh to Ling in respect of which Ling gave ten post-dated cheques of $26,000 each. The interest to be charged was 3%. In my view it is so obvious that it must be 3% pm and not 3% per year. No moneylender in his right mind would lend money at 3% pa. Two hundred thousand at 3% pm, over ten months, on a non-reducing basis, works out to $260,000. The evidence was that only three out of the ten cheques issued by Ling had been banked in. Counsel asked why weren`t the other seven cheques banked in. The answer to this question is again quite extraneous to the 15 charges. In any event I would observe that the time for banking in the fourth cheque almost coincided with the commencement of the investigation by CPIB into this matter which eventually led to the present prosecution.
Having reviewed the record of appeal, I am of the opinion that there was ample evidence both oral and documentary for the district judge to have found the appellant guilty of each of the 15 charges. No reasonable doubt has been raised. The district judge has heard Ling and believed what he said. This was not a case where Ling went on his own to report the appellant`s misdeeds to CPIB. The appellant could not give any reason why Ling would want to incriminate the appellant if the allegations were not true. They got on well and Ling was grateful. But faced with the CPIB investigation into his books, Ling had to come out with the truth. Counsel said that the district judge placed too much emphasis on the meeting at Merlin Plaza. I do not think so. It seems to me that the district judge dealt with that matter in some detail because of the submission of counsel for the appellant at the court below. That incident went to show the state of mind of the appellant as soon as the CPIB commenced their investigation. In his CPIB statements, the appellant initially denied that he went to meet Ling at Merlin Plaza on 2 January 1983. Counsel for the appellant sought to play down the significance of that denial on the ground that it arose out of a confused state of mind. If the meeting at Merlin Plaza was as innocuous as the appellant and Ramesh (who testified for the defence) made it out to be, why should the appellant even deny that he was there? In any event, the district judge after hearing the evidence rejected the appellant`s version of what was the object of the meeting at Merlin Plaza and what transpired thereat. He found that the appellant was `the instigator of the meeting for the sole purpose of persuading and deceiving the two Lings (Ling and his son) to change their statements to the CPIB`. The district judge appeared to have borne this particular incident in mind in determining whether the appellant was guilty of the 15 charges. In my view, he was justified in so doing. It was clearly r elevant to the 15 charges: see illus (e) to s 8 of the Evidence Act. It was conduct consistent with that of a guilty mind and the district judge was entitled to draw such inference therefrom as he deemed fit. One final point: Counsel asked if it was likely that a bank officer would accept a bribe by way of a cash cheque drawn on his own bank? Considering the nature of a cash cheque and how it is cashed, I do not see anything so improbable about that.
On the evidence, the district judge found that Ling was a witness of truth. There is no reasonable ground for me to disturb that finding. Accordingly, the convictions of the appellant on the 15 charges are neither against the weight of the evidence nor wrong in law and should be upheld. Lest the same criticism be made that I have not dealt with all the detailed points raised by counsel, let me say that I have considered them but have not been persuaded by those points.
I now turn to deal with the charge involving the taking out of a life policy of a million dollars by Ling. It was not in dispute that the appellant was, in fact, an authorized agent of the AIA. There was no evidence that Ling knew of this fact. Ling denied such knowledge. The appellant said in his defence that he informed the previous chief manager of BNP that he was such an agent of AIA. However, in his earlier statement to the CPIB, he said that he did not so inform his superior officer. Not that it is material to the charge, it seems clear to me that the appellant was moonlighting.
On this charge, the district judge said, inter alia, this: 
 
Ling also told the court that the accused asked him to take out a life policy ... The reason being that Ling had used so much money in his account and should anything untoward happen to him, the bank would be protected ... For this policy the accused obtained a commission of $13,278. It is clear from the evidence ... the accused was playing on the ignorance of Ling and this was a subtle way of soliciting for a gratification. On paper it was an insurance sale but in effect a gratification of $13,278.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the district judge had not applied the correct test in considering the charge. He submitted that the prosecution had to show that the appellant had corruptly obtained the sale of the policy to Ling as an inducement to the appellant in permitting Ling to draw on the account in excess of the authorized overdraft limit. He said it was wholly untenable for the district judge to just say `It is clear from the evidence ... the accused was playing on the ignorance of Ling and this was a subtle way of soliciting for a gratification. On paper it was an insurance sale but in effect a gratification of $13,278.`
Whether a payment was corruptly obtained and accepted is a question of fact to be determined by the court in the light of all the circumstances of each case: 
 Mohamed Ali bin Mohamed Iqbal v PP 
 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 58
 .
Ling said in evidence that he took out the policy because the appellant asked him to `so that should anything happen to (him), the bank would have a guarantee`. The appellant had also told Ling that he `had used so much money of the bank`. This was what Ling said in cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: This was for your protection and the accused discussed it with you? 
 
A: He said since I owed the bank so much money, it was better for me to take out a life policy. 
 
Q: That was how the life policy came about? 
 
A: I took out the policy because the bank wanted more security in view of my outstanding debt.
  
 
 
On this evidence of Ling, it was clear that pressure was brought to bear on Ling to take out the policy. While it was not in dispute that a life policy was in fact issued by AIA in favour of Ling, a fact which the district judge was aware as the district judge had observed `on paper it was an insurance sale,` that did not necessarily mean that the receipt of the commission by the appellant from the sale could not be corrupt. The charge itself was on the premise that a genuine policy was issued by AIA to Ling. The relevant part of the charge reads: 
 
You, on or about 16 February 1982 ... did corruptly obtain for yourself a gratification in the form of the sale of a life policy to one Ling ... for which you subsequently earned a commission of $13,278 from AIA as an inducement to do an act in relation to your principal`s affairs, to wit, granting overdraft facilities to Asiaweld Shipbuilding Pte Ltd in excess of the authorized limit ...
 
 
 
Having regard to what Ling said as the reason why he took out this policy and also to the state of account of Asiaweld Shipbuilding on 16 February 1982, I am satisfied that the conviction is correct and that the appellant did corruptly obtain a gratification of $13,278.
The submission of Mr Cashin in the court below was primarily based on the evidence of the appellant that Ling took out the policy on his own free will for the benefit of his wife and family so that if Ling should die the property of his wife to be mortgaged to the bank would not be seized by the bank. The district judge obviously did not accept this version of what transpired between the appellant and Ling. I do not think there is anything in the evidence which suggests that the district judge was wrong to reject that. Mr Cashin further made the point that if BNP had required the policy as additional security it would have asked Ling to assign the policy to BNP as was normally the case. But we know as a fact that the bank did not require the additional security of a life policy from Ling. Mr Kettler said so and he also said, `life insurance is very costly and I believe very few people would in fact agree to such a condition`. He said life policy would only be required for private lending, eg loan to purchase a home. Be that as it may, the important point that counts is, what did the appellant tell Ling to induce him to take out the policy. The fact that the policy was not assigned to BNP is quite immaterial.
 Second group of charges
There are five charges under this group, four of which relate to the receipt of four sums of money from Firoz Khan. The fifth relates to the taking out of a life policy by Firoz Khan in respect of which the appellant earned a commission of $12,168. Firoz Khan was a director of Aisha Pte Co, which company had an account with BNP with overdraft facilities.
The first payment was alleged to be made on 13 March 1980. Firoz Khan said that on that day he issued a cheque for $10,000, went to the bank to cash it and gave $9,000 to the appellant in the latter`s office. When asked to explain how it was that the reverse side of the cheque did not bear his signature, as he claimed he had gone to cash it, he offered two explanations, none of which appeared sensible. Eventually, he said that `it is possible that I may have someone with me at that time whom I might have given the cheque to cash when I was with the accused.` He was vague indeed and was just speculating. It is therefore essential that his evidence should be scrutinized carefully.
Another significant aspect relating to the first payment is this. The relevant cheque stub has the following entry `cash - loan to Mr Stephen Tan`. Stephen Tan was a colleague of Firoz Khan. On the evidence of Farouk Khan (PW37) the court was told that Stephen Tan disappeared after owing Aisha a large sum of money. He said Aisha had been lending money to Stephen Tan over a period of time. However, under cross-examination, Firoz Khan said that he had only one or two dealings with Stephen Tan and he denied Aisha ever lent money to Stephen Tan. This was a clear contradiction on a material point between two prosecution witnesses which was not addressed to and reconciled by the district judge. Further, when asked how it was that he made such an entry when the money was, according to him, given to the appellant, Firoz Khan explained that he could hardly have written the appellant`s name on it. He said he had to be subtle. Yet in the cheque voucher (exh P119) issued on the occasion of the second payment of $5,000 made on 6 October 1980, he expressly wrote the words `Paid to Jayaram`. When confronted with such inconsistencies he said it was irresponsibility on his part to have written the words `Paid to Jayaram` in exh P119. I would observe that the cheque stub for the second payment of $5,000 also had this entry `Jayaram - commission .
The evidence of Firoz Khan as to the place where he made the second payment of $5,000 to the appellant was also unsatisfactory. In examination-in-chief, he said this was paid to the appellant at the Hyatt Hotel on a Saturday afternoon. When confronted that 6 October 1980 was a Monday, he clarified: 
 
I made four payments. Once at the Hyatt, the others at his office. But I cannot say which cheque was cashed for which payment. I remember the $9,000 was sure paid in his office.
 
 
 
There was a lapse of about ten months before the third payment was made on 25 August 1981. Firoz Khan said a month after the second payment, he encountered obstacles in operating the account. When pressed for specifics, he said, `a number of times large amount ... would be returned.` He explained: 
 
I don`t know how many times I said this. The money that was given to the accused was not given immediately after the favour was granted. Four payments were made over a period of time for consideration of assistance in granting extra credit line beyond what was granted by the bank, going through the statement does not help us one bit.
 
 
 
But on Firoz Khan`s evidence a letter (1 September 1981) was written by the appellant warning Aisha not to issue cheques without sufficient funds (exh P122). That was barely a week after the alleged third payment was made. Such acts on the part of the appellant in dishonouring two cheques and writing the warning letter did not appear to be consistent with the conduct of a person who barely a week ago had received $5,000 as reward.
According to Firoz Khan, he was upset enough to report to Mr Souloumiac (PW1), an operations manager, and Mr Kettler (PW2) the second man in BNP. The appellant knew PW1 quite well. It would have been an easy matter to set up a trap. Yet that was not done. He said, `It is not in my nature.` `Further, he said he asked PW2, `Do you sanction the fact that I have to continue to pay?` and PW2 replied, `For now`, or words to that effect. However, PW2 said that Firoz Khan told him that `Jayaram was asking for money to get better facilities and that he was not prepared to do so.` Firoz Khan did not tell PW2 that he had paid bribes to the appellant. Firoz Khan only asked PW2 for a change of officer. If Firoz Khan did in fact tell PW2 that he had been paying bribes to the appellant, then the subsequent conduct of PW2 was totally inexplicable. According to PW1, the complaint of Firoz Khan to PW1 was that Firoz Khan wanted an increase in the facility but Firoz Khan could not get it `because Jayaram was asking for money and he (Firoz Khan) did not want to give.` Both PW1 and PW2 did not appear to believe Firoz Khan`s complaint that the appellant was asking for money as they took no action on the complaint.
I am afraid these are points which go to the very credibility of Firoz Khan and should have been examined more carefully. They were not touched on by the district judge. Take the alleged first payment of $9,000 - the evidence of Firoz Khan was in direct conflict with what was stated on the cheque stub: `loan to Stephen Tan.` Farouk Khan (PW37), the brother of Firoz Khan, told the court that Stephen Tan had been taking loans from Aisha. Firoz Khan tried to explain why the cheque stub entry was written in that way. He said he had to be subtle. Yet, he was not very subtle when it came to the second payment. If it were just a matter of not being consistent in the maintenance of record it would not have been of such great significance. But here there was evidence (at least from Farouk Khan) that Stephen Tan had been taking loans from Aisha. What made the judge think that the $9,000 could not be a loan to Stephen Tan, bearing in mind that Firoz Khan was even confused as to how the cheque was cashed as mentioned above. The district judge did not explain how he reconciled these. The answers are certainly not apparent from the evidence. In the circumstances, the conviction on the four charges should not be allowed to stand.
As regards the charge involving the life policy taken out by Firoz Khan, it was true that in his evidence-in-chief he said that he never believed in life policy. Firoz Khan said that the appellant had suggested to him that his request for facilities would be granted if he took out a policy for a million dollars making Aisha Pte Ltd the beneficiary.
However, I note that Firoz Khan had frequently been to Mount Elizabeth Hospital as he was then suffering from a kidney ailment. It was while Firoz Khan was in hospital that the appellant spoke to him about life policy. The following questions and answers in cross-examination are pertinent: 
 
 
Q: I suggest to you, you went into hospital and had this talk with the accused, and he pointed out to you if you were to die, your company would be left with the debt and the security would be exhausted in paying this debt? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I suggest to you that what he said struck you (as) good sense? 
 
A: I suppose that is fair. 
 
Q: It was only then you took out this policy? 
 
A: Following that I took the policy. 
 
Q: At what stage your OD came down? 
 
A: Early `83. 
 
Q: Then there was no necessity to keep the policy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that why you did not continue your policy? 
 
A: I allowed it to lapse.
  
 
 
In re-examination, Firoz Khan said that he took the policy because the appellant asked him to.
The district judge found that the appellant`s motive in broaching the subject of a life policy was prompted solely by the appellant`s own interest and the interest of the bank; it was not prompted in the interest of Firoz Khan and his family. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the district judge did not apply the correct test in determining the guilt of the appellant on the charge.
Being a part-time AIA agent, of course, it would benefit the appellant if he could sell the policy to Firoz Khan. The appellant`s motive in wanting to make some money out of the sale of the policy could not be in doubt. However, that was not really the point. As indicated above, when dealing with the charge involving Ling, there must be more than just the sale of a policy by the appellant to an account holder to constitute the offence of corrupt gratification. The point or the test must surely be whether the appellant did apply undue pressure on Firoz Khan and whether that was the reason why Firoz Khan took out the policy. It was not denied that it was the appellant who raised the subject of a life policy when Firoz Khan was in hospital for an ailment. When compared with Ling, it seems to me that Firoz Khan was very much a man of the world. Whereas the district judge noted that Ling was `a rather simple-minded man and was easily misled`, he did not say the same of Firoz Khan. Firoz Khan is from a business family. His father is a well-known businessman. Firoz Khan had no misconception of a life policy. He answered in cross-examination that the reasoning which the appellant gave him for taking out a life policy did make good sense and thus he took out the policy. The district judge did not seem to have adequately considered this important aspect of the evidence.
It must also be borne in mind that Mr Kettler (PW2) said that he had no objection to his staff selling insurance to customers provided it was not carried out during working hours and there was no conflict of interest. No suggestion was made that there was a conflict situation here. As the district judge did not appear to focus his mind on the right issues and/or sufficiently consider the evidence in determining the guilt or otherwise of the appellant, and as it has been shown in relation to the other four charges that the evidence of Firoz Khan was less than reliable, the conviction on this charge must also be quashed.
 Third group of charges
Under this group there are two charges, both involving one Cheo Boon Teong (Cheo) who said that he gave to the appellant $5,000 on 21 December 1981 and $6,500 on 4 December 1981. At the relevant time, Cheo was a director of Haifung Shipping and was also the shipping adviser of Lotus Agencies. Then Haifung Shipping had an account with BNP with overdraft facilities. Lotus also had an account with BNP but without overdraft facilities.
Sometime in August 1981 the overdraft facilities granted to Haifung was increased from $1m to $1.5m. Cheo was grateful to the appellant for the assistance he had given in obtaining the increased overdraft and also for the indulgences the appellant granted to Haifung. He issued a cash cheque for $5,000 and asked a staff, one Leo Teng Kit (Leo) to cash it. Leo gave the $5,000 to Cheo. Subsequently, Cheo placed the $5,000 into a red packet and that packet was put in a white envelope. Cheo then asked Leo to deliver the envelope to the appellant at his office. Leo did not see what was placed into the envelope which he delivered to the appellant. The cheque issued was from the account of Lotus Agencies. The relevant cheque stub had this entry `Cash (Haifung Shipping Pte Ltd); cash advance on accounts`. Cheo explained that he had used Lotus Agencies account to pay the bribe because the account of Haifung had by then exceeded the overdraft limit.
As regards the second payment involving $6,500, Cheo said that he issued a cash cheque for $6,500, had someone cash it and gave the sum in cash to the appellant in the latter`s house after the latter and his family returned from a holiday to New Zealand in November 1981. This sum was given in appreciation of the assistance rendered by the appellant in granting a temporary overdraft to Lotus without security as and when Lotus was short of money. The monthly statement of accounts clearly showed the instances when temporary overdraft was granted by BNP. The relevant cheque stub showed that the original entry was blanked over and in its place was written the following: `Cash - special bonus for cleaning hatches and lashing of deck cargoes.`
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the conviction on these two charges cannot stand on a number of grounds. The main ones appear to be these. First, in relation to the first charge, the district judge was wrong to say that there was corroboration of Cheo`s evidence by Leo, the messenger sent by Cheo to cash the cheque and subsequently was sent by Cheo to deliver a white envelope to the appellant. Cheo`s evidence was that he placed the cash of $5,000 in a red packet which in turn was placed in a white envelope. It is true that Leo did not see the cash of $5,000 being placed in the red packet which in turn was put in the white envelope. But Leo`s evidence corroborated Cheo`s evidence on the fact that he was sent by Cheo to cash the cheque; that Leo handed the cash to Cheo and that Cheo sent him to deliver a white envelope to the appellant at BNP. The court was also told by Leo that when Cheo handed the white envelope to Leo, Cheo told Leo that the white envelope contained a red packet which in turn contained the $5,000. I think there can be no doubt that Leo`s evidence corroborated Cheo`s evidence on some material particulars. In any event, a court could convict on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice: s 135 of the Evidence Act.
Second, in relation to the second charge, Cheo said that he wanted to hide the fact that the payment was made to the appellant and thus told Connie Lam, his clerk, to record in the books that the payment was a special bonus made to the staff though he also told her that the money was meant for the appellant. Yet in the record book (exh P154) Connie Lam expressly stated that the payment was `actually paid to Mr Jayaram`. Her explanation for these words were `I wrote the words ... because it was a cash cheque and nobody signed for the receipt payment voucher.` Counsel submitted that she was inconsistent: if she was prepared to state in the record book that payment was actually for the appellant, why then did she have to blank out the original entry in the cheque stub and make a different entry in its place. I do not think her explanation is in any way unbelievable. We must bear in mind her duty as the accounts clerk. It has not been suggested that she had anything against the appellant.
Thirdly, Cheo said that other than these two payments he did not make any other payments to Jayaram. Yet in the record book there were two entries which seemed to indicate that one more payment and a gift were given to the appellant. One entry on folio 104 of exh P154 read as follows: `Cash Haifung Shipping Pte Ltd - advance.` Just above the word `advance` were the words `for Jayaram` written in small letters in pencil. Connie Lam said that those two words were written by her. Another entry on folio 188 of exh P154 had the following statement: `Haifung Shipping Pte Ltd - purchase of gift for Mr Jayaram` and the amount shown against that item was $5,000. When confronted with these two entries Cheo`s answer was: `I don`t remember.` Counsel sought to rely on these two additional entries in the record book to show that the record book was cooked-up. This was denied by Cheo. Cheo did say early in the course of cross-examination that he did give hampers to the appellant. Connie Lam, in cross-examination, denied that she did any rewriting of the record book. I do not see how the existence of the two additional entries and the fact that Cheo could not remember them show that the two entries which are the subject of the charges must therefore be false. The district judge believed Cheo and must have found the two entries to be true notwithstanding the existence of the two additional entries in relation to which Cheo could not remember.
In my judgment, having reviewed the evidence, it has not been shown that the conviction on the two charges are against the weight of the evidence. Neither do I find that the district judge has misdirected himself or has misconstrued any material fact. I would uphold the two convictions.
 Charge involving Haji Moosa
Haji Moosa (Moosa) was an account holder with BNP. This charge concerned a loan of $10,000 allegedly given on 12 June 1980 by Moosa to the appellant because of the help which the appellant rendered to Moosa. The loan was by way of a cash cheque for $10,000 post-dated 30 August 1980. Moosa said in evidence that sometime before 12 June 1980 the appellant told Moosa that his father was sick. On 12 June 1980, the appellant rang Moosa to ask for a loan of $15,000. This request for a loan of $15,000 was noted by Moosa in his diary. As he could not afford to lend the appellant $15,000, he agreed to $10,000. He agreed to give this loan because the appellant had helped him on a number of occasions to negotiate letters of credit and had also assisted him in obtaining better rates for foreign exchange. Moosa post-dated the cheque 30 August 1980 as requested by the appellant. In the journal and the ledger, Moosa had instructed his bookkeeper (Nachiappan - PW19) to record this payment as purchase of coconut oil. Moosa said that he recorded the transaction in this manner because the appellant asked him not to put the appellant`s name in his record books. However, in his cheque stub Moosa claimed he had made the entry `cash and Jayaram loan.`
Moosa left for India on 6 July 1980 and only returned to Singapore on 12 November 1980. During his absence his business here was in the charge of his nephew, Mohd Thaha (PW18). On 21 August 1980 while in India, Moosa telexed Thaha (exh P127A) asking him, inter alia, to `inform Jayaram BNP to hold my cheque until 30 September` without specifying which cheque. The reply of Thaha was on the same day and was exh D12 where it was stated `Jayaram agreed to hold cheque.` I would observe that the district judge seemed to have overlooked that exh D12 was actually the reply to exh P127A. Then on 23 September 1980, Moosa telexed his nephew (exh P127C) to ask him to `pay Jayaram dollars five thousand and also tell (Jayaram) balance payable next month.` Moosa must have made this request knowing that he had earlier asked the appellant to hold on to the cheque until 30 September 1980 to which the latter had agreed. The reply to this of Thaha was at exh P127D where he informed Moosa that the appellant had given the cheque to another party and exchanged cash and that that party would be drawing the money that week and it was not good to stop the payment then. However, as the subsequent bank statement showed, the cheque which was allegedly issued on 12 June 1980 was in fact cashed on 1 September 1980.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the conviction cannot be sustained on, inter alia, these grounds: 
 
 
(i) The district judge erred in saying that the evidence of PW18 (Thaha) substantially established the case against the appellant on the charge. 
 
(ii) The district judge did not even bother to address the question whether it was likely that a person who wanted a loan because his father was ill would ask for a post-dated cheque of more than two months? 
 
(iii) Moosa said he wrote on the cheque stub `cash and Jayaram loan` but his bookkeeper Nachiappan said that the cheque stub only had the words `cash` on it and thus he had to ask Moosa what that cheque was all about so as to make the necessary entries in the journal and ledger. On being cross-examined regarding this discrepancy, Moosa admitted `possibly one of them was wrong.` The district judge did not allude to this discrepancy. Further, this crucial cheque stub had been missing. 
 
(iv) Nachiappan initially said that he made the entries regarding this cheque in the journal and ledger sometime within the first ten days of October 1980 after receiving the September 1980 statement from the bank. Later when it was shown that Nachiappan could not have made the entries in October 1980 because he was not in Singapore, he said that he must have made the entries in January 1981 after his return from India. Thus the reliability of the entries in the journal and ledger was doubtful.
  
 
 
Counsel submitted that besides the error made by the district judge on point (i) above, the district judge, in failing to address the issues set out in points (ii), (iii) and (iv) showed that he did not carefully examine the evidence notwithstanding that the district judge stated that he had done so.
I have scrutinized the evidence relating to this charge and would agree with counsel for the appellant that the district judge had placed unwarranted significance on the evidence of PW18. He remarked that the correspondence referred to by PW18 was `solid documentary evidence`. All that the correspondence showed was that PW18 was asked by Moosa to contact Jayaram to hold on to a cheque until 30 September. There was no reference to any specific cheque, and in so far as PW18 was concerned he had no idea which cheque was being referred to. The fact that there was this correspondence between Moosa and PW18 was not in dispute. But there was nothing in PW18`s evidence which suggested that the cheque referred to in the correspondence had anything to do with the cheque which was allegedly issued on 12 June 1980 to the appellant as a loan. More importantly, the correspondence, particularly exhs P127A and D12, showed something else very significant. They showed that Jayaram agreed to hold on to the cheque until 30 September 1980. Yet from the bank`s statement we know that the alleged cheque given as a loan was, in fact, cashed on 1 September. This is a clear discrepancy. Did the correspondence refer to the same cheque or to a different cheque? In my judgment, the district judge had misconstrued the evidence of Thaha and placed on it such significance which was not warranted. On this ground alone, I would have to allow the appeal on this charge.
Moreover, when viewed in conjunction with grounds (ii) and (iii) listed above, the case for setting aside the conviction becomes all the more compelling. The judge should have addressed the issue: would a person ask for a post-dated cheque (for more than two months) if he wanted a loan because his father was sick? There might be an answer but it certainly was not apparent from the evidence. Even Moosa was not able to answer that question. All he said was that that was what the appellant asked him to do. This point goes to the root of the question of the loan and by not addressing it I am of the view that the district judge has failed to consider a material issue. Similarly, on the point regarding the discrepancy in the evidence of Moosa and Nachiappan as to what was written on the cheque stub, the district judge merely recited the facts as stated by Moosa without so much as to state whether or not he accepted the version given by Moosa in preference to the version of Nachiappan. On cross-examination even Moosa conceded that one of them could be wrong. And if it were Moosa who was wrong, this must have some effect on his other evidence. I am not given the benefit of the district judge`s thinking on this.
 Sentence
The grounds upon which counsel for the appellant argued that the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive are these: 
 
 
(a) The district judge erred in law to take into account the fact that the appellant had tried to suborn prosecution witnesses in imposing sentence. 
 
(b) The district judge did not give adequate or sufficient consideration to the following matters: 
 
(i) The bank was not the complainant and had suffered no loss. 
 
(ii) In so far as the charges involving Ling and Cheo are concerned, the appellant never solicited the bribes in question from those two persons. 
 
(iii) The appellant was not a public officer. 
 
(iv) For the appellant, this case involved not just the loss of a job, but an entire career in the banking field.
  
 
 
On the first ground, counsel relied on the case 
 R v Quinn 
 (1932) 23 Crim App R 198, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, where Hewart LJ said: 
 
In view of the statements of the deputy chairman it appears to this court to be clear that some part of this sentence is to be attributed to the fact that, in the view of the deputy chairman, the appellant had given false evidence. If false evidence is given there are appropriate ways of dealing with the offence. In our opinion, it is not correct to increase a sentence on that ground. That is, in effect, to find the prisoner guilty of perjury without a charge and without a trial and to punish him for that offence.
 
 
 
As the appellant was not charged and convicted of the offence of suborning witnesses, the district judge was, on the authority of 
 Quinn 
 (1932) 23 Crim App R 198, wrong to have taken that fact into account in determining sentence.
I accept the submission of counsel for the appellant that it was through hard work and determination that the appellant managed to rise from a clerk after leaving school to being a senior officer with BNP. Through self-study he obtained two professional qualifications, the Chartered Institute of Secretaries and the Institute of Bankers. Now everything is in ruins for him.
Counsel also submitted that in view of the long lapse of time since the commencement of the present proceedings it would not be fair to put the appellant through a term of imprisonment and that a find should be adequate. Counsel said that the appellant was convicted and sentenced by the district judge on 28 August 1985. However, the record of the proceedings was not made available to the appellant nor was the DPP able to inform me of the cause for the delay. Be that as it may, I do not see any prejudice to the appellant by the delay. He has been on bail. The case 
 Voon Chin Fatt v PP 
[1948-49] MLJ Supp 131 is clearly distinguishable.
Having considered all the circumstances, it seems to me that a fine would be wholly inadequate for the offences which the appellants has committed. This is not a case of the receipt of an isolated corrupt gratification. In so far as the charge involving Ling are concerned, they stretched over a period of 16 months. Though the appellant did not ask for it, he willingly accepted every offer of gratification by Ling. The amounts involved were substantial. The appellant had abused a position of trust. A custodial sentence is called for. However, taking into account the grounds advanced by counsel in (a) and (b) (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, including the fact that the appellant previously had a clean record, I agree that the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive and would reduce them as follows: 
 
 
DCA 2369/84 : six months to three months 
 
DCA 2370/83 : six months to four months 
 
DCA 2371-2375/83 : Three months (each charge) to two months (each charge) 
 
DCA 2376-2377/83 : two months (each charge) to one month (each charge) 
 
DCA 2378-2385/83 : three months (each charge) to two months (each charge) 
 
DCA 2386/83 : 12 months to 6 months
  
 
 
The sentences imposed by the district judge on the five charges involving Firoz Khan and the one charge involving Haji Moosa are set aside as the appeal on those charges are allowed.
I order that the sentences for DCA 2370/83, DCA 2371/83 and DCA 2386/83 be served consecutively and the other sentences be served concurrently with the said three sentences. In short, the appellant is to serve a total prison term of 12 months. In addition, the appellant shall also pay a penalty of $54,078 as required under s 13(1) of the Act. In the result the appeal is allowed to the extent as indicated above.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The first appellant, JB Jeyaretnam, was on 15 June 1988 convicted on the following charge: 
 
... that you, on or about January 1987, at about 1.10pm at the five foot way of house No 80 Boat Quay, Singapore, did provide public entertainment without a licence issued under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257), to wit, by addressing a public gathering and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 18(1)(a) of the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257).
 
 
 
The second appellant, Wong Hong Toy, who was tried together with the first appellant, was also convicted on a similar charge, save that his address was made at about 1.05pm. The appellants were each sentenced to pay a fine of $3,500 and in default two weeks` imprisonment. The fines have been paid. The appellants have appealed against conviction and sentence.
The relevant facts were as follows. On 5 January 1987, the first appellant, who was the secretary-general of the Workers` Party (WP), a duly registered political society under the Societies Act (Cap 311), submitted an application, in the prescribed form, for a licence under the Public Entertainments Rules 1969 to hold the opening ceremony of the WP`s premises at No 80-A Boat Quay on 10 January 1987 from 12 noon to 4pm. The application, which was signed by the first appellant, listed both the appellants as speakers and the following entertainment to be provided: (1) lion dance, (2) Indian drums, and (3) Malay kompang. The form also stated that a `PA system would be used`.
The application and the covering letter were received at about 2.45pm on the same day by the licensing officer appointed under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257) (the Act). The covering letter requested that the licence be issued by 9 January 1987. The application was rejected on 9 January 1987 and the letter of rejection was despatched to the first appellant`s office on 10 January 1987 between 8.30am and 9.00am and was received by the office attendant.
On 10 January 1987 at about 1 pm, the police received information that a crowd of about 150 people had gathered along the frontage of No 80, Boat Quay to hear the first appellant speak. There was also a lion dance in the vicinity. PW1, a police superintendent, went to investigate. He saw a crowd of people along the frontage of No 80, Boat Quay and the first appellant standing behind a rostrum addressing them. PW1 went up to the rostrum and asked the first appellant whether he had a permit. The first appellant`s reply was: 
 
No, I don`t have a permit. Yes you can. You can have my name and address. Alright. Yes, you can take action. I have just been informed by the police officer that we do not have a permit for this. (Jeerings)
 
 
 
The short answer to this, my friend, is that we applied for a permit and were told that it was not granted. So we decided to carry on. (Pause)
The second appellant was also present at the scene. He was seen by PW2, another police officer, who saw a crowd of about 100-200 persons with some 60-80 sitting on chairs in front of the pavement of No 80, Boat Quay. PW2 went there to ensure that there was no breach of the peace. He found an orderly crowd. He saw and heard the second appellant addressing the crowd in Mandarin after the master of ceremonies had addressed the gathering. After the second appellant had spoken, the first appellant spoke. Another police officer, PW3, who was also at the scene, testified that he had made a tape-recording of the speeches and that there were microphones on the rostrum from where the speeches were made.
That, in brief, was the evidence adduced by the prosecution. Both the appellants submitted they had no case to answer. Their submissions were rejected by the district judge who held that the evidence, if unrebutted, would warrant their conviction on the charges faced by the appellants. Accordingly, he called for their defence and, upon the appellants electing not to enter their defence, convicted both of them.
The first appellant has in this appeal contended that his conviction was wrong on the following grounds: 
 
 
(a) his speech made at No 80 Boat Quay was not per se public entertainment under the Act, and therefore no licence was required; 
 
(b) if the speech was public entertainment under the Act, there was no evidence to show that he had provided it; 
 
(c) the decision of the licensing officer in rejecting his application was contrary to law and null and void and was an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of speech and expression conferred by art 14(1) of the Constitution of Singapore.
  
 
 
Counsel for the second appellant associated himself with all these arguments, which I will now consider.
Section 18 of the Act provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) Any person who provides or assists in providing any public entertainment not being a public entertainment exempted under section 15 
 
(a) without a licence issued under this Act; 
 
(b) while the licence is suspended; 
 
(c) in contravention of any condition of a licence; or 
 
(d) in contravention of this Act or any rules made thereunder;
  
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000. 
(2) For the purposes of this section no person shall be deemed to have provided or assisted in providing public entertainment merely by reason of his having taken part in the public entertainment provided.
 
 
 
The expression `public entertainment` as used in the Act has a wider meaning than its ordinary meaning. Section 2 defines the expression to include the activities specified in paras (a) to (o) `in any place to which the public or any class of the public has access whether gratuitously or otherwise, but does not include` the activities specified in paras (i) to (iv) (viz public entertainment at state functions, religious ceremonies or rites, and meetings of public companies, trade unions, political associations or societies from which non-members are excluded). Most of the activities included in the definition would qualify as entertainment in its ordinary sense of amusements and diversions, eg plays, operas, fireworks displays, circuses, parades, exhibitions of films, models, etc. Others such as `play-readings, recitals, lectures, talks, addresses, debates and discussions` in para (1) may be performed for more serious purposes than entertainment in its ordinary sense. Some of the specifically excluded activities, eg religious rites and ceremonies, are not entertainment or meant to be entertaining.
Notwithstanding the extended meaning of `public entertainment`, the first appellant contended, first, that the Act could not have been intended to and did not apply to the making of speeches in a public place on the ground that, prior to the proceedings against him, no one else had been prosecuted for making speeches in public without a licence. He referred to speeches made at the openings of factories and offices and at wedding dinners in restaurants, which events were regularly reported by the media. He also referred to a recent literary event, viz the launching of a book at Raffles Place when speeches were made, without a licence under the Act, and no one had been prosecuted in connection with the event. This attitude on the part of the authorities, he submitted, was an indication as to the intention of the Act.
The first appellant contended, secondly, that an address was no entertainment if its dominant purpose was not entertainment, and that would explain why there were no prosecutions in connection with speeches `at wedding dinners in restaurants (which were to celebrate the nuptials) and at openings of factories and offices (which were to celebrate the openings)`. Similarly, it was argued that the opening of the WP`s branch premises was not to entertain the guests.
In my view, neither argument has any substance for the following reasons: first, the first appellant has produced no evidence to show that in the instances cited by him, the persons involved were not prosecuted on the ground or grounds stated by him. Absence of a prosecution does not mean absence of an offence. Secondly, there is also no basis for assuming that restaurants, factories and offices are places to which the public or any class of the public has access. No person has access to a restaurant if his patronage is rejected by the restaurant, and even if he is accepted as a customer, he cannot be said to have access to another part of the restaurant where another function is being held, except by an invitation to that function. Thirdly, by reason of the statutory definition, whether an activity is `public entertainment` is not determined by its purpose or its nature and/or effect but simply by its form.
In the present case, there was no dispute that the appellants had addressed a crowd of people at a public place. The only issue is whether their speeches were public entertainment. The ordinary meaning of the word `address` is a speech made to a group of people, usually on a formal occasion. Here, it was the opening of the WP`s branch premises. There is no reason to suggest that the same word in s 2(1) does not bear its ordinary meaning. This was precisely what had occurred on this occasion. The first appellant had never contended that his speech was not an address in its ordinary meaning.
However, the second appellant contended otherwise. His counsel submitted that the speech of the second appellant was a welcoming speech and not an address, without explaining the difference between the two. If the second appellant had merely said: `I welcome you to this official opening of the Workers` Party branch office. I now call upon [Mr X] to address you`, it might be arguable that he had not made an address in terms of the Act. But, the second appellant said more than that; he extolled the fortitude of the supporters of the WP for being present on a rainy day and in showing `them` that as citizens they were not cowards. It was a short but defiant speech to lift the spirits of the WP members who were present. Accordingly, I reject his counsel`s submission.
The next contention of the first appellant was that there was no evidence that he had provided public entertainment in terms of s 18(2) of the Act. He submitted that the evidence showed that he had merely participated in the public entertainment that was provided. In my view, there is again no substance in this argument. The word `provide` in the context of s 18(2) means `supply`. A person may supply the entertainment by performing it himself or by engaging someone else to perform it. Thus, any person who gives an address also, literally, provides the address, and if he does it in a public place without a licence, he commits an offence under the Act. As innocent guest speakers or entertainers may unwittingly commit offences under the Act, s 18(2) is designed to provide a defence to such participants. Whatever the precise effect of s 18(2) may be, it does not provide a defence to the appellants. They were not mere participants at the function. They were the organizers of the event. The application for the licence was made by the first appellant and the application form was signed by him. Both the first and second appellants were named as the speakers. They were respectively the secretary-general and chairman of the WP. The occasion was the opening of the WP`s branch premises. It was clearly an important occasion for the WP as was evident from the contents of the first appellant`s speech. In my view, this evidence was sufficient to prove, in the absence of rebutting evidence, that the event, including the speeches, was planned and arranged by the appellants as the two principal office bearers of the WP. They were not guest speakers who merely took part in the event. I have no doubt that the first appellant provided the public entertainment, if not in the form of his own speech, then in the form of the speech made by the second appellant. The position of the second appellant was exactly the same, save that he did not sign the application form. But, as chairman of the WP, he could not, and he did not, say he had nothing to do with the organization of the event. In his case, I have no reasonable doubt that he had also provided public entertainment by his own speech or if not, by the first appellant`s speech.
I turn now to the constitutional argument advanced by the first appellant, which is that he was wrongfully denied his constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression given to him as a citizen by art 14 of the Constitution. I set out below the material parts of this article. 
 
 
(1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) 
 
(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression; 
 
(b) all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and 
 
(c) all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations.
  
 
 
 
(2) Parliament may by law impose 
 
(a) on the rights conferred by clause (1)(a), such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence;
  
 
 
It is not disputed by the first appellant that the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right exercisable by any citizen without any restraint in all circumstances, but one which is subject to the power of Parliament to enact any law to impose on such right such restrictions it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of any of the matters enumerated in art 14(2) of the Constitution. The first appellant has also not contended that the Act is not such a law within the scope of art 14(2) of the Constitution. His case is that the decision of the licensing officer in refusing his application was not made in relation to any of the matters in respect of which the Constitution has permitted Parliament to restrict the right to freedom of speech and expression, that is to say, in the interest of public order or public morality or the security of the state. Specifically, he contended that the licensing officer rejected the application because he was told to do so by an official in the Ministry of Home Affairs, and had therefore failed to exercise his power at all or properly, or if that were not the reason for the rejection, the licensing officer had no other reason for rejecting the application; in either case, the decision was bad in law as there was no nexus between the decision and the objects of the Act. That being the case, it was then contended that no offence had been committed as he was exercising his constitutional right.
Leaving aside for the moment the validity of the legal conclusion that he had committed no offence if the decision of the licensing officer were wrong, what was the evidence relied upon by the first appellant to show that it was wrong? The relevant part of the licensing officer`s testimony was as follows: 
 
On receipt of P26 (the application for the licence) I checked through the application to see whether the necessary columns were completed and I proceeded to check my records to see whether there have been similar applications from political parties in the past. I found that there were none. I then proceeded to refer the application to my immediate supervisor in the Criminal Investigation Department for his transmission to the Ministry of Home Affairs for instructions. All this is necessary in the normal screening of the applications. I also informed the Deputy Commissioner of Police Operations Command of this application; Director CID and other command officers. They were informed clearance was also sought from Area Commanders and `A` Division in which area 80 Boat Quay is. Prior to application I did not check for exemption order because there was no such application seeking exemption from the applicant. By 9 January 1987, the decision was arrived in the evening of 9 January 1987. The application was rejected.
 
 
 
Under cross-examination, the licensing officer (PW4) made the following admissions: that the application, being from a political party, was referred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in compliance with normal administrative procedure; that in point of time the application was rejected on the evening of 9 January 1987 immediately after he had spoken with one Lim Siam Kim, then deputy secretary of Home Affairs. When the first appellant questioned PW4 as to wether Lim had told him to refuse the application, the trial judge disallowed the question on the ground that it was not relevant. When PW4 was questioned on his reasons for refusing the application, the trial judge again disallowed the question on the ground that the issue before the court was whether public entertainment had been provided, the absence of a licence not being disputed. When the first appellant put to PW4 for his answer an assertion of fact and law that PW4 had refused the application on the direction of the Minister or the permanent secretary and that the decision was contrary to the Constitution and invalid under the Act, the suggestion was also disallowed by the trial judge.
That, briefly, was the evidence upon which the first appellant contended that the licensing officer failed to exercise his power and/or had no reason to refuse the application. The contention is plainly untenable for lack of a factual foundation. The licensing officer did not give his reasons because he was prevented from doing so. No inference could be drawn from this that he had no reasons to give, or that those reasons would be bad reasons. This is not a case where the court may draw an adverse inference against a witness for refusing or failing to give evidence of facts especially within his own knowledge. The correct position must be that as the matter now stands neither the first appellant nor the court knows the reasons for the rejection.
Under s 13(2) of the Act, the first appellant was entitled to ask the licensing officer for the reasons for rejecting his application. He omitted to exercise this right at that stage. He contended that he was still entitled to exercise it at the trial. In my view, he was wrong. The purpose of s 13(2) is not to enable a person charged for an offence under the Act to ask for the reasons at the trial. The purpose is to enable an aggrieved applicant to appeal to the Minister under s 14 of the Act. There was no question of an appeal to the Minister in this case.
It seems to me that the real thrust of the first appellant`s submission was that if the licensing officer had been allowed to answer his questions, the answers might have been such as to have enabled him to satisfy the court that the refusal was wrong or unconstitutional. 
 If 
 this were the correct legal position, I would agree that the first appellant was entitled to cross-examine PW4 on the reasons for his decision. It is a basic rule in a criminal trial that the accused is entitled to put any relevant questions to any prosecution witness in order to elicit evidence to support his defence. A denial of that right could lead to a miscarriage of justice.
In support of the argument that he had committed no offence under the Act if the licence had been wrongfully refused, the first appellant referred to two decisions, viz 
 Madhavan Nair & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 264
  and 
 Lau Dak Kee v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 229
  (which authorities were made available to the court through the industry of the DPP). In my view, these decisions are distinguishable. Both cases arose out of the issue by the OCPD under s 27 of the Police Act 1967 of a licence to Madhavan Nair to hold a public meeting subject to the condition that no speaker should touch on matters relating to the MCE results and the status of Bahasa Malaysia as the national language. The appellants committed a breach of the condition and were charged accordingly. By way of defence, the appellants argued that the condition was unconstitutional as being in breach of art 10(2) of the Malaysian Constitution (which corresponds in all material respects to art 14(2) of the Constitution). It was held in both cases that the condition was valid. If, in those cases, the condition had been declared invalid on the ground of unconstitutionality, the appellants would have committed no offence as the licence granted to them would have become an unconditional licence. In the present case, the appellants had no licence at all.
The soundness of the first appellant`s submission may be tested by assuming that the licensing officer wrongfully refused the licence. What were his legal rights? The court would have quashed the decision if the appellants had commenced proceedings for judicial review. The licensing officer would then have to consider the application afresh. If he refused, the court would have the power to direct him to do so. But, the court would not have been able to grant a licence to the first appellant or direct the licensing officer to do so, as the power of court is exercisable by way of supervisory jurisdiction in these matters. Therefore, the invalidity of the decision of the licensing officer would result in nothing more than the appellants` status quo ante the application. They would still have had no licence when they provided the public entertainment. The law was that no public entertainment might be provided without a licence under the Act and except in accordance with the terms of the licence. The law was not that public entertainment might be provided subject to such restrictions as might be imposed under the Act. It must follow that the answers of the licensing officer, whatever they might have been, could not have provided any defence to the appellants on the charges against them.
In my view, the only available defence to the charges, in the context of this case, would be that the Act (or, what is the same thing, the scheme of licensing established by the Act) is unconstitutional as being in contravention of art 14(2) of the Constitution to the extent that it affects the right to freedom of speech and expression. But neither appellant made any submission to such effect. Indeed, when the court inquired of the first appellant whether he was making this submission, he replied that he was not. He went on to submit that even though s 13(1) of the Act provided that the licensing officer might in his discretion refuse any application for a licence, that discretion could not be exercised arbitrarily in view of s 14 which was, as he put it, a guide as to how the discretion should be exercised. As s 14 provides for the cancellation at any time of a licence under the Act for any reason connected with, inter alia, public order, public morality or the security of the state, which are interests in respect of which Parliament may legislate to impose restrictions on the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression, this was in effect a submission or a concession that the Act, even to that extent, was within the scope of art 14(2) of the Constitution. If the discretion vested in the licensing officer under the Act were absolute and untrammelled, there might be a case for arguing that the licensing scheme is unconstitutional, as then the licensing officer would have been vested with arbitrary power to deprive a citizen of his constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression contrary to the objects of art 14(2): see

In 
 Indulal v State of Gujarat 
 AIR 1963 G 259 Miabhoy J, after a full review of the US and Indian authorities on the right to freedom of speech and expression under the constitutions of those countries, upheld a statutory scheme of licensing the use of loudspeakers at public meetings which vested the power to grant or withhold such licences in the Police Commissioner of Ahmedebad on the ground that under the statute in question such power was not arbitrary and untrammelled. Miabhoy J, at p 270 para 28, said: 
 
That the licence cannot be arbitrarily refused is also quite clear from the fact that, in the licensing rules, the use of loudspeaker is prohibited only in order to prevent obstruction, inconvenience, annoyance, risks danger or damage to the residents or the passengers in the vicinity. Thus the extreme power of prohibiting the user of loudspeakers is also not a naked and arbitrary power, but, it is hedged in by a few conditions which indicate the policy governing the exercise of that power. The objects which are to be achieved by making such a rule are clearly mentioned. As we have already pointed out these objects can best be achieved by the Legislature by leaving the powers in the hands of those on whom the duty of preservation of the public order is imposed from day to day.
 
 
 
In another part of his long judgment when dealing with the possibility that the power of licensing might be abused, Miabhoy J, at p 269 para 26, said: 
 
Moreover, a study of the various provisions of the Bombay Police Act reveals the policy of the Legislature and the purpose for which the Act is enacted and, as we have already pointed out, there is authority of the Supreme Court which has clearly laid down that if a power is given to an executive officer, the power has necessarily to be exercised by the officer in enforcement of that particular policy. It is conceivable that a partial or a corrupt official may in a particular case ignore the policy of the Act and may so use his power that, on a particular occasion, he may, on extraneous considerations, deprive the citizen of the right of the use of a loudspeaker. But, as has been pointed out in AIR 1954 SC 465, a restriction cannot be held to be unreasonable on the ground that the power may be exercised by an officer mala fides. As pointed out in the same case, in such a case, the arms of the court are strong enough to deal with such a refractory officer.
 
 
 
In 
 Arthur Francis v Chief of Police 
 
[1973] AC 761
 the Privy Council, after reviewing decisions from the United States, India, Pakistan, the West Indies and Canada and identifying the principles to be applied to determine the extent to which the constitutional right of free speech and expression under the constitutions of those countries could be validly restricted by ordinary legislation, held that s 5 of the Public Meetings and Processions Act 1969 did not constrain s 10 of the Constitution of St Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla. Section 10 provided for the enjoyment of freedom of expression subject however to the power of the legislature to enact laws that are reasonably required in the interest of defence, public safety public order, public morality or public health and other matters. Section 5 of the said Act provided that no person might use any noisy instrument at any public meeting without the permission of the Chief of Police who might, in his discretion, grant permission upon such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as he might think fit. Lord Pearson, in delivering the opinion of the Privy Council, at pp 772-773, said: 
 
Whatever may be the exact construction of s 10, it must be clear that (1) a wrongful refusal of permission to use a loudspeaker at a public meeting (for instance if the refusal is inspired by political partiality) would be an unjustified and therefore unconstitutional interference with freedom of communication, because it would restrict the range of communication, and (2) some regulation of the use of loudspeakers is required in order that citizens who do not wish to hear what is said may be protected against `aural aggression` if that might reach unbearable intensity.
 
 
 
As some regulation of `noisy instruments` is required, and a system of licensing is the natural method, there must be some licensing authority to grant or refuse the permission. The legislature of the state concerned has decided that the Chief of Police is the suitable officer to be given this power and duty. There is convenience in that choice, as he is concerned with the preservation of public order and knows the prevailing conditions affecting it and therefore is able to give a quick decision. There is no evidence, and no reason to infer, that he has abused the power or would be likely to abuse it in any way. It is reasonable to assume that the legislature, knowing the local conditions, made a suitable choice of licensing authority.
The final question is whether s 5 of the Act is so defective as to be unconstitutional because it does not expressly lay down guidelines for the exercise by the Chief of Police of his licensing power. Whether or not it might have been better to have some express provision as to the way in which his discretion should be exercised, he is not without guidance. It is plain from the preamble to the Act and from its provisions as a whole that its object is to facilitate the preservation of public order. That being the object of the Act, he must exercise his powers bona fide for the achievement of that object. 
 Roncarelli v Duplessis 
 (1959) 16 DLR (2d) 689, per Rand J (with whom Judson J concurred), at p 705, per Martland J (with whom Kerwin CJ and Locke J concurred) at p 742 and per Abbott J at p 729. Section 5 is not defective, or at any rate not seriously defective, in this respect. It does not contravene the Constitution.
Article 14 of the Constitution does not contain the same language as that in s 10 of the Constitution of St Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla or as that in art 19 of the Indian Constitution; (the latter constitutions permit only `reasonable` restrictions on constitutional rights). However, I am of the view that the test of constitutionality applied in both 
 Indulal 
AIR 1963 G 259 and 
 Arthur Francis 
 
[1973] AC 761
 is relevant to determine whether the Act contravenes art 14(2).
In 
 Arthur Francis v Chief of Police 
 
[1973] AC 761
, the Privy Council said that a wrongful refusal of permission to use a loudspeaker at a public meeting would be an unjustified and therefore unconstitutional interference with freedom of communication. The Privy Council however did not say what the consequence of such a breach was. As their Lordships had specifically held that s 5 was not in breach of the Constitution, the consequence could not possibly be the invalidity of s 5 but rather the invalidity of the decision itself. A decision which is invalid for unconstitutionality does not, by itself, make the law under which the decision is made invalid. A law which is invalid for unconstitutionality makes all decisions made under it invalid.
Accordingly, as the Act is not unconstitutional, it follows that the appellants were properly convicted on the charges faced by them.
Before I consider the submission in relation to the appeals on sentence, I should like to refer to a material fact in these appeals which appeared to have escaped the attention of counsel and the DPP. It should be recalled that the charges on which the appellants were convicted were that they had provided public entertainment at No 80, Boat Quay. The evidence proved conclusively, and the first appellant has admitted in the course of the argument before me, that the speeches were made on the five-foot way of No 80 Boat Quay which was in law a public thoroughfare for pedestrians, and therefore a place to which the public had access. It should also be recalled that the application made by the first appellant for the licence was for public entertainment to be provided at `the opening ceremony of Workers` Party premises at No 80-A Boat Quay`. In P26, the same address was given in the column bearing the caption `Address or locality at which event will take place`. These premises, as admitted by the first appellant, was the second level of the two-storey building, whereas No 80-A occupied the first level of the building. No 80 Boat Quay was not the same place as No 80-A Boat Quay. The first appellant had never applied for a licence to provide public entertainment at No 80 Boat Quay. It must follow that whatever the fate of the application was in this case, the appellants had no defence to the charges against them.
I turn now to the appeals on sentence. The appellants were both fined $3,500. The district judge in imposing the fine of $3,500 each took into account the following factors: (1) the previous convictions of the appellants (five in respect of the first appellant and four in respect of the second appellant); (2) their deliberate intention to commit the offence in the knowledge that they had no licence under the Act; and (3) their mitigation speeches. The first appellant contended that the fines of $3,500 was manifestly excessive having regard to the nature of the offence, the maximum penalty for the offence (a fine not exceeding $5,000), and the judgment of the Privy Council in 
 Jeyaretnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 425
 . In that case, the Privy Council declared that the first appellant had been wrongly convicted of the four Penal Code offences which the district judge had taken into account.
He therefore submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive and wrong to the extent that it had taken into account these convictions. Further, he submitted that although the district judge had also taken into account one other previous conviction for which he was fined $1,500, that conviction was for a different and unrelated offence under s 3(2) of the House To House And Street Collections Act (Cap 128) and in respect of which the maximum penalty was a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both. He also contended that he had complied with the law by applying for a licence and that the rejection came too late for him to cancel the function as he had invited foreign dignitaries to attend it.
The second appellant also had four previous convictions, having been convicted jointly with the first appellant in respect of the Penal Code Offences. His counsel accordingly submitted that the fine of $3,500 was manifestly excessive and wrong on the same ground relied upon by the first appellant. Counsel also claimed that his client did not know that a licence was required or that the licence had not been obtained when he addressed the gathering, and that the second appellant had merely made a welcoming speech of about one to two minutes, and that, unlike the first appellant, the second appellant was not told by the police to refrain from speaking.
The DPP`s submission was that the sentence was not manifestly excessive for the following reasons: (a) that the appellants showed a brazen disregard of the law and had committed the offence knowing full well that they did not have a licence; (b) that the police had been inconvenienced in that they had to perform crowd control duty; and (c) that the appellants in committing the offences had failed to pay the licence fees. The DPP declined to make a submission on whether this court should, for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of the sentences, have regard to the decision of the Privy Council in 
 Jeyaretnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 425
 . Instead, he submitted that the said convictions were irrelevant to the present conviction and that he did not wish to rely on them for the purpose of these appeals on sentence. In view of the stand taken by the DPP and the fact that he has not addressed me on the status of these convictions, I do not propose to say more about them. I shall disregard them as irrelevant for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of the sentence under appeal.
On this basis, the first appellant had one previous conviction for an unrelated offence and the second appellant had no previous conviction. The only other negative factor against the appellants was that they had deliberately broken the law. That, of course, is not an exceptional factor as it is normally present in most convictions. It is a factor which is more important when imposing sentences for subsequent offences of a similar nature. There were no other adverse factors that could be put on the scale against the appellants. There was no evidence that any disorderly conduct or breach of the peace had occurred at or in connection with the addresses made by the appellants or that any member of the public or any of the residents of the neighbouring premises had been unduly inconvenienced, or that their peace of mind or tranquillity unduly disturbed by this infraction of the law. Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, including the nature of the offence and conduct of the appellants, I am of the view that a fine of $1,500 would be the appropriate sentence to be imposed on each of them.
The appeals against conviction are dismissed and the appeals against sentence are allowed to the extent that the fines are reduced to $1,500 in respect of both appellants.
 Order accordingly.",1989-10-10 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant was convicted by the High Court of the offence of murder. [See 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 437
 .] We dismissed his appeal and now give our reasons.
At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant advanced two grounds.
 The first ground 
The first ground is that the trial judges had erred in law and in fact by admitting in evidence the statement of the appellant recorded under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC).
Counsel for the appellant conceded that the statement was made voluntarily, and without any inducement, threat or promise. However, he argued that the provisions of s 122(6) had not been complied with by the investigating officer who recorded the statement thereunder in that the investigating officer did not explain the charge nor the prescribed warning to the appellant.
The relevant facts were as follows:
On 15 October 1985 at 6.10pm, the investigating officer, one Inspector Lee Kim Seng, through a certified interpreter, one Wong Shue Hong, charged the appellant with murder. This was done by Inspector Lee reading in English a typewritten charge, which was interpreted by Mr Wong in Cantonese for the appellant, who was a Hong Kong seaman. The appellant signed the typewritten charge. According to Inspector Lee, this was to acknowledge that he understood it. Inspector Lee and Mr Wong also signed the typewritten charge.
At 6.15pm the same day, Inspector Lee wrote the charge out on a piece of paper and read it to the appellant in English. Mr Wong interpreted it in Cantonese for the appellant. The appellant, Inspector Lee and Mr Wong signed below the handwritten charge. Inspector Lee then wrote the following words: 
 
The above charge which is similar to the typed (sic) written one read earlier was read and explained to the accused by the interpreter. The accused understood the charge and signed after it. The interpreter and I also signed.
 
 
 
Then, all three of them signed again. Inspector Lee then wrote on the paper the following warning: 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.
 
 
 
Inspector Lee read the warning to the appellant in English. Mr Wong interpreted it in Cantonese for the appellant. The appellant, Inspector Lee and Mr Wong signed below the warning. Inspector Lee then wrote the following words: 
 
The above Notice of Warning was read and explained to the accused by the interpreter. Having understood it, the accused was invited to sign after it. The interpreter and I also signed it. I then served a copy of the charge and Notice of Warning to the accused.
 
 
 
Then, all three of them signed again. A copy of the piece of paper on which the charge and warning was written was then served on the appellant.
The appellant then made a statement through Mr Wong which was recorded in English by Inspector Lee as follows: 
 
I admitted that I stab (sic) him (the deceased) with the knife because on four occasions the deceased threatened to ask someone to assault me when we return (sic) to Hong Kong. On the last occasion on 15 October 1985 at about 6.30am, the deceased wanted attack me with a knife but I ran away. Later, when I saw the deceased, he (deceased) told me that he would certainly asked someone to beat me up when the ship return to Hong Kong. Some crew members heard what the deceased said. These incidents provoked me into stabbing the deceased. Therefore, on 15 October 1985 at about 11.20am, I took a fruit knife from my room and met the deceased at the pantry. On seeing the deceased, I was so angry that I stabbed him (deceased). I do not know where I stabbed him. It was the deceased who had driven me to do such thing to him. The deceased always complained to the chief steward that I did not do my work properly.
 
 
 
The appellant signed the statement. Inspector Lee and Mr Wong also signed. All three of them signed again after the following words which were handwritten by Inspector Lee: 
 
On 15 October 1985 at about 6.58pm, the accused completed his statement. It was then read back to him by the interpreter. He affirmed that it was true and correct. The accused was then invited to sign after it.
 
 
 
The interpreter and I also signed likewise. I then invited the accused to make any alteration, addition or deletion to his statement, but he declined. The statement was volunteered by the accused. There was no inducement, promise or threat made to the accused by either the interpreter or myself to obtain it.
 
 
 
Mr Wong died on 15 April 1987 before the case came to trial and so was not available at the trial to give evidence of what he said in Cantonese to the appellant when he interpreted the typewritten charge, the handwritten charge and the warning.
Inspector Lee testified that as regards the typewritten charge and the warning, he had asked Mr Wong to read and explain them in Cantonese to the appellant. As regards the handwritten charge, he had asked Mr Wong to find out from the appellant whether he wished to have Mr Wong read and explain it, the handwritten charge being similar to the typewritten charge read earlier. According to Inspector Lee, the appellant`s reply was that there was no necessity to do so.
On these facts, counsel for the appellant argued that s 122(6) of the CPC had not been complied with, and the statement purportedly recorded thereunder had been wrongly admitted in evidence.
It was argued that Inspector Lee had not explained to the appellant the definition of murder under s 300 together with all the exceptions. It was also argued that Inspector Lee had not explained that the charge of murder would attract the death penalty. Finally, it was argued that it was the duty of the investigating officer, and not the interpreter, to explain the charge and warning to the appellant.
Section 122(6) reads: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, 
 which shall be explained to him
, to the following effect:
 
 
 
`You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for (set out the charge).
 
 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.` (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant emphasized the requirement in s 122(6) that the notice in writing `shall be explained to` the accused. First, he argued that it meant that both the charge and the warning must be explained. Next, he argued that the failure to explain either would in law render a statement purportedly recorded under s 122(6) inadmissible. In support of both arguments, he relied on the High Court decision in 
 PP v Chan Sway Beng 
 
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
 .
In that case, after the accused was charged with murder, the investigating officer assisted by an interpreter proceeded to record a statement from the accused, following, as the investigating officer understood it, the procedure set out by the then s 121(6) [now s 122(6) of the CPC].
At the sub-trial, it was not disputed that the investigating officer read the charge and the warning to the accused word for word and that at no time did he explain the charge and the warning beyond reading both out. He did, however, ask the interpreter to explain both the charge and the warning to the accused which the interpreter did by interpreting word for word what the investigating officer read to the accused, and no more. At the conclusion of the sub-trial, the court declined to admit in evidence the statement made by the accused to the investigating officer. The reasons given by the court are to be found at p 412 of the report: 
 
In setting out to record a statement from the accused, [the investigating officer] had proceeded under s [122 (6)] of the Criminal Procedure Code. That subsection provides that a person who is invited to make a statement `shall be served with a notice in writing` (the warning) `which shall be explained to him ...`. The warning incorporates the charge, and it follows that both must be explained.
 
 
 
It was plain from the evidence before us that the charge was not explained to the accused; nor was the warning. Both were read out to him in English, and interpreted to him, word for word, in Cantonese. That is all. It is true that the accused signed statements written out on P52 to the effect that he understood both the charge and the warning, which statements were themselves interpreted to him, but we were not persuaded that this cured the omission to explain the charge and the warning.
 
 
 
Section [122(6)] and s [123(1)] were enacted in 1976. The combined effect of these two subsections is that, where a person in the position in which the accused found himself fails, upon being administered the warning provided by s [122(6)], to mention a fact which he could reasonably have been expected to mention, the court may draw adverse inferences against him. Having removed the right, which previously existed, of an accused person to remain silent without adverse consequences, the l
 egislature was, by enacting ss [122(6)] and [123(1)], conferring upon the accused the right, if he wished, to make a statement in exculpation of himself at a certain stage of the proceedings against him, which the court was entitled to take a full account of
.
 
 
 
 
 That, it seemed to us, could well be why s [122(6)] required that the warning be `explained`
. ... (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The court then held: 
 
We declined to admit the accused`s statement by reason of the failure of (the investigating officer) and (the interpreter) to explain the charge and the warning to the accused and for no other reason.
 
 
 
Section 122(6) itself does not provide for the admissibility of statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation.
That s 122(5) governs the admissibility of statements made under s 122(6) is confirmed by s 122(7), which reads: 
 
No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to subsection (5), if it is otherwise voluntary.
 
 
 
In our judgment, a statement whether or not it is purported to have been made under s 122(6) is admissible in evidence so long as s 122(5) is satisfied. There is no doubt that an inculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein. It is not necessary for us to decide whether an exculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein or, as the High Court put it another way in 
 Chan Sway Beng 
`s case, one `which the court was entitled to take a full account of`. We understand that this issue has arisen in 
 PP v Chan Kim Choi 
 
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 404
  where the High Court held that exculpatory statements when given in accordance with s 122(6) and tendered in court pursuant to s 122(5) may be admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence, but not as truth of the contents thereof. Since this issue has not arisen before us and since the decision of the High Court is under appeal, it is premature for us to comment on the decision.
However, apart from being admitted under s 122(5) of the CPC as an inculpatory statement or an exculpatory statement or as a mixed statement containing both inculpatory and exculpatory parts, a statement made under s 122(6) may be admitted under s 122(5) for another purpose, namely, the purpose stated in s 123(1) of the CPC. Section 123(1) provides: 
 
Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any fact, 
 being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed
, as the case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer, and the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In such a case, the statement is admitted as evidence of the failure by the accused to mention a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed and thereby enabling the court to draw such inferences as appear proper.
In our opinion, non-compliance with s 122(6) results not in a statement being inadmissible - since, as we have said, its admissibility depends on s 122(5) - but in enabling the court having to take such non-compliance into consideration when deciding what inferences, if any at all, should be drawn from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts.
It may well be that the court considers the non-compliance of s 122(6) serious enough so that it will not draw any inferences at all from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts. On the other hand, the non-compliance may be trivial in nature, eg a non-material typographical error in the notice in writing, and the court will not in such a case be prevented from drawing such inferences as appear proper.
The test is whether it could be said that the circumstances existing at the time when the accused was charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, were such that he could not as a result of the non-compliance with s 122(6) be reasonably have been expected to mention certain facts on which he was relying in his defence in court. Or put another way, was the result of the non-compliance such that he was not made aware that his right to remain silent without suffering adverse consequences had been removed by s 122(6) and s 123(1)?
On the facts of the instant case, we observed that the trial judges were not invited to make inferences from the failure of the appellant to mention certain facts. In fact, the statement was not tendered as evidence of the failure of the appellant when charged to mention facts which he was relying on in his defence at the trial. His evidence at the trial was substantially the same as what he said in his s 122(6) statement. No new defence was raised at the trial which was inconsistent with the s 122(6) statement. If anything, the s 122(6) statement was a previous consistent statement of his evidence and of his defence, which, if admitted in evidence as it was, was favourable to the appellant`s case, or at least did it no damage.
Clearly, then, once s 122(5) had been satisfied, the statement was admissible as a mixed statement containing inculpatory and exculpatory parts. We cannot see how, particularly in absence of any reliance by the prosecution on s 123(1), it could be argued by the appellant that non-compliance with s 122(6) should affect the admissibility of the statement.
It is sufficient for the purposes of disposing of the first ground for us to have decided that the trial judges were not wrong to admit the appellant`s s 122(6) statement for the reasons we have stated without going on to decide whether on the facts the requirement in s 122(6) that the notice in writing `shall be explained to [the appellant]` had or had not been complied with.
However, as the question is one of general importance, we proceed to make some observations on the requirement that the notice in writing `shall be explained`. Section 122(6) is, save for the addition of the words `which shall be explained to him`, word for word taken from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in England which are contained in their Eleventh Report (Comnd 4991). While the addition of the words confers some measure of protection for an accused person whose right to silence has been affected, albeit not removed, by the enactment of ss 122(6) and 123(1) - and such protection is important especially if the accused person is uneducated or illiterate - it can, in our opinion, create some unnecessary problems.
First is the problem of what the mandatory explanation should consist of. Should the explanation of the charge and of the warning involve an explanation of the law relating to the offence which is the subject matter of the charge, as counsel for the appellant tried to argue before us? If so, are police officers competent to give such explanations? What is the effect if they err in their explanations? Can the police officers or interpreters remember what explanations they gave to the accused since such explanations are not recorded in writing? Can an accused waive the requirement that the charge and notice be explained? If he does not understand the explanations, is he under a duty to let the police officers know so that further explanations can be given or can he keep mum, sign a note that he has understood the charge and the notice and complain at the trial that they have not been explained or sufficiently explained to him? Can the charge be always explained to someone with low intelligence?
A second possible problem is that, unlike the notice in writing, the mandatory explanations do not seem to be exempted by s 122(7) from being any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to s 122(5). This will become important if the explanations are challenged as being inaccurate, or even outright wrong.
In our opinion these problems and other possible problems would not arise if the word `explained` in s 122(6) were deleted and substituted by the word `read`.
However, the fact remains that s 122(6) contains the requirement that the notice in writing `shall be explained`. In our opinion, the requirement is satisfied if an accused person is told in general terms what the charge and warning mean. Since accused persons differ in background, what form the explanation should take must ultimately depend on the facts of each case.
On the facts of the instant case, we have no reason to disturb the finding by the trial judges that s 122(6) had been complied with. They dealt with the issue at [
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 437
  at p 440] of the grounds of decision as follows: 
 
In the present case, the forms of the charge and the warning both contained statements signed by Inspector Lee, the interpreter and the accused that the charge and the warning had been read and explained to the accused by the interpreter and that the accused had understood. Inspector Lee in his testimony said he instructed the interpreter to read and explain both the charge and the warning to the accused. He admitted that he did not ask the interpreter to explain the charge of murder by reference to s 300 of the Penal Code or to explain any of the special exceptions to s 302 (sic) to the accused. The accused, in his testimony, said that he understood the charge to be one of murder under s 302 of the Penal Code. He did not say that the warning had not been explained to him or that he had not understood it.
 
 
 
Having regard to the evidence, we were satisfied that the charge and the warning had been read and explained to him and/or at any rate that he understood both the charge and the warning.
 
 
 
We agreed and for the reasons stated above, this ground of appeal must fail.
 The second ground 
The second ground is that the trial judges had erred in law and in fact in finding that the stabbing of the deceased by the appellant was done with the intention of causing bodily injury to the deceased and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
Section 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which was relied upon by the prosecution to make out the offence of murder in the trial below, reads: 
 
300 Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death;
  
 
 
Two local cases have considered the scope and meaning of the third limb of s 300 of the Penal Code.
In 
 Mimi Wong & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
 , the Court of Criminal Appeal decided that a person cannot be found guilty of murder by the application of the third limb of s 300 unless it is proved that the fatal injury found to be present was the injury intended to be inflicted.
In 
 PP v Visuvanathan 
 
 
 
[1978] 1 MLJ 159
 , the High Court decided that all the prosecution need prove, for the application of the third limb of s 300, is:
 
 
(1) that the deceased did an act which caused the death of the deceased; 
 
(2) that the said act was done with the intention of causing bodily injury; 
 
(3) that the injury caused - 
 
(a) was intended and was accidental or otherwise unintentional; and 
 
(b) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
  
 
 
The decision was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Criminal Appeal No 22 of 1976.
Therefore, in so far as the law is concerned, that is settled. The trial judges below applied the test laid down in 
 PP v Visuvanathan 
.
The only question before us is whether the trial judges were wrong in finding on the evidence before them that the case came within the third limb of s 300 of the Penal Code.
On the facts of the instant case, it was not disputed that the appellant did an act which caused the death of the deceased: the appellant stabbed the deceased with a fruit knife and this caused the death of the deceased.
It was not disputed that the injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The deceased had died from massive bleeding due to a single stab wound at the right side of the anterior abdominal wall region. The wound measured 6.5cm x 2.8cm when lax but 7cm with the margins of the wound approximated together. The wound was 10 to 12 cm deep. It had cut through a part of the large intestine, the small intestine, and the root of the mesentery, which is the layer of fatty tissue that connects the small intestine to the back of the abdomen from whence it gets its blood supply. The knife also penetrated the aorta running along the spinal column, entering it and exiting on the other side and terminating in the muscle lying next to the spinal column. Doctor Clarence Tan, the forensic pathologist who gave evidence of the injuries at the trial, was of the opinion that it was virtually impossible to save a person who had suffered this kind of injury.
In other words, elements 1 and 3(b) of the 
 Visuvanathan 
test were not disputed.
The only arguments raised before us were that the act of stabbing was not a voluntary (ie deliberate) act as it had occurred during a struggle and the appellant did not intend to inflict the injury in question.
In other words, elements 1 and 3(a) of the 
 Visuvanathan 
test were disputed.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judges had erred in finding that (a) the stabbing was a calculated and deliberate act; (b) the appellant had intended to stab the deceased in a vulnerable part of the body; and (c) the deceased was taken by surprise and unable to shout for help.
The evidence, he submitted, showed that there was a probability that the injury could have been caused during a struggle. These are questions of fact. An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. The trial judges below dealt with the issue as follows at p 442: 
 
In his closing address, counsel for the accused submitted that the defence had created a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had intended to kill the deceased or to cause him such bodily injury as was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It was contended that the act of stabbing the deceased in the stomach was not a voluntary (ie a deliberate) act as it had occurred during a struggle. Also, the accused had not intended to puncture the aorta, and if the aorta had not been punctured, the deceased would not have died. It was also contended that the accused had only stabbed the deceased once and that if he had intended to kill him, he would have inflicted more injuries.
 
 
 
We could not accept this submission. The accused had, in his own words, wanted to teach the deceased a lesson by stabbing him with a knife. He went to his cabin and brought the knife to the pantry in order to stab the deceased. The knife had a 6 inch blade. Where he had intended to stab the deceased, the accused did not say but still he intended to stab the deceased. As regards the accused`s testimony that the stabbing occurred during the struggle, we were prepared to accept his evidence that there was some sort of struggle in the sense that the deceased had struggled with the accused for possession of the knife or to prevent the accused from stabbing the deceased. In our view, the deceased was taken by surprise and was unable to shout for help. Otherwise Yong, who was outside the pantry in the passage way would have heard something. In our view, the struggle did not make the stabbing an accident. The struggle occurred because the deceased was trying to prevent the accused from stabbing him. He failed to do so because he was weaker than the accused and he paid for it with his life. In our view, the stabbing was a calculated and deliberate act. Although only moderate force was required to cause the injuries that were actually caused to the deceased, the accused had intended to stab the deceased in a vulnerable part of the body. The accused admitted that he was thrusting the knife forward at the deceased at waist level. The stabbing was done with the intention of causing bodily injury to the deceased and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. In this respect, we applied the test laid down by a panel of this court, which test was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 PP v Visuvanathan
 
 
 
[1978] 1 MLJ 159
  at p 161.
 
 
 
We see no reason to disturb the findings of the trial judges. In the result, the second ground must also fail. For all the above reasons, we unanimously dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was tried before the senior district judge and convicted of six amended charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) (the Code). The charges alleged that the appellant had cheated six patients of specified sums of money over different periods, by deceiving them into believing that they were suffering from various serious diseases and needed follow-up treatment and had thereby dishonestly induced them to continue to receive treatment from him and in respect of which varying sums of money were paid by them to him. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year for each of the charges and as required by s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) (CPC), two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. The other sentences were to be served concurrently with the said two sentences. The appellant has appealed against both conviction and sentence.
I do not propose to set out all the six amended charges on which the appellant was convicted but only the first two which should be adequate to show the sort of charges that were preferred against him: 
 
You, Dr Chow Dih, are charged that you, between 14 June 1983 and 22 July 1983, at 56, Blk 32, Cassia Crescent, Singapore, cheated a patient one Koh Teow Hock by deceiving him into believing that he had a `growth of calcium` in one of the organs in his abdomen and that as such he would need follow-up treatment and you thereby dishonestly induced him to receive treatment from you and to deliver property to you of the following amounts on the respective dates:
 
 
 
14 June 1983 $ 80
 
 
 
 
(15) June 1983 $ 150 
 
(16) June 1983 $ 23 
 
(17) June 1983 $ 23 
 
(18) June 1983 $ 33 
 
(14) July 1983 $ 115 
 
(16) July 1983 $ 35 
 
(18) July 1983 $ 35 
 
(20) July 1983 $ 35 
 
(22) July 1983 $ 45
  
 
 
which sum amounted altogether to $574 which he would not have done had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 103,1970 Ed).
 
 
 
You, Dr Chow Dih are charged that you, between 30 July 1983 and 20 August 1983, at 56, Blk 32, Cassia Crescent, Singapore, cheated one Mdm Teo Guek Eng by deceiving her into believing that her daughter, namely, Chan Yin Ling was suffering from a kidney disease and that the said Chan Yin Ling would require daily treatment for two weeks and you thereby dishonestly induced the said Mdm Teo Guek Eng to cause her daughter to receive treatment from you and to deliver property to you of the following amounts on the respective dates:
 
 
 
30 July 1983 $ 90
(1) August 1983 $ 150 
(2) August 1983 $ 22 
(3) August 1983 $ 24 
(4) August 1983 $ 22 
(16) August 1983 $ 22 
(17) August 1983 $ 22 
(18) August 1983 $ 32 
(19) August 1983 $ 22 
(20) August 1983 $ 41
 
 
 
which sum amounted altogether to $447 which she would not have done had she not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed).
 
 
 
The other four charges are very much along similar lines, except that the patients, the deceptions, the periods and sums involved are different.
For the purposes of this appeal, counsel for the appellant has not argued that the findings of the trial judge that the appellant had practised the various deceptions on the patients were erroneous. He has conceded that point.
Indeed, I do not see how the appellant could possibly challenge those findings as the trial judge has, in a very careful and detailed grounds of decision which runs into some 295 pages, analysed the evidence before coming to his decision. The appellant`s counsel has, however, submitted that the convictions are bad and wrong in law for two main reasons:
 
 
(i) the sums stated in each charge failed to take into account the amount which was rightfully due to the appellant in respect of the treatment properly give to each patient and which had nothing to do with any deception, particularly with regard to the first visit of the patient; 
 
(ii) in respect of some of the charges, there was no evidence to show that the deception was the effective cause why the patients kept returning to the appellant to receive treatment; on the contrary, the evidence showed that, notwithstanding the deception, each patient was treated for his actual ailments(s) which was the real reason why he or she returned to the appellant for treatment.
  
 
 
As the first submission raises a general point of law, I think I should deal with it forthwith. As I understand it, the submission is this. There was, particularly in respect of the first occasion when each patient went to see the appellant, a certain amount of fee that was lawfully due from that patient to the appellant for consultation and treatment for the ailment for which the patient came to see the appellant in the first place. The deception could only have provided a basis for the appellant to charge more and to ensure that the patient would return for treatment. By not deducting such amount which was lawfully due to the appellant from the amount actually paid by each patient to the appellant, the charge is, accordingly, bad in law. Counsel for the appellant went on to submit that if the charges on which the appellant has been convicted are bad, an appellate court is not competent to amend the charges under s 256 of the CPC and the appellant should be acquitted. On this point he relied on 
 Yoong Hock Pin v PP 
 
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 178
 , 
 Quek Ching Kim v R 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 54
  and 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
 .
The deputy public prosecutor`s answer to this submission is briefly as follows. First, the amount paid on each occasion by the patient was the amount demanded by the appellant following the deception. Further, through the deception, the appellant made each patient return to him for consultation. It was not necessary for the prosecution to separate each payment into two components, the legitimate portion and the illegitimate portion. Secondly, and in the alternative, even if some part of the fee paid on the first visit, or on the subsequent visits, was for legitimate consultation and medication and should be deducted from the amount stated in the amended charges, this is clearly an error and an irregularity falling within s 396 of the CPC and should be cured. There has not been any failure of justice as the appellant knew precisely what he had to meet.
At the outset, I must observe that in a case such as this, neither the patient nor the prosecution would be able to specify what the correct amount that was legitimately due to the appellant and which had nothing to do with the deception was unless the doctor himself gave a detailed breakdown of the fee demanded by and paid to him. Indeed, the appellant is the best person to know what the extra fee he charged on account of the deception was. It would appear that in respect of the six patients who were deceived, they were not told of the breakdown of each sum demanded by the appellant. The various amounts paid by the patients (or a parent of a patient) were never disputed by the appellant at the trial. This point was also never canvassed by the defence before the trial judge: thus it was not specifically dealt with in the grounds of decision. If this submission is correct, then it would mean that a doctor who practised deception like the appellant could not be charged for cheating because the prosecution would never be able to prove what the illegitimate portion of the fee demanded was unless the doctor gave a breakdown to the patient when payment was made. In my view, this submission cannot be correct. Take for example the first charge where Koh Teow Hock (PW8) paid to the appellant $80 on 14 June 1983. It appears to me obvious that the appellant could not have legitimately charged and the patient would not have paid him $80 but for the deception. The fact that if there were no deception PW8 would have to pay something less than $80 (perhaps substantially less) for consultation and treatment for which he sought from the appellant is beside the point. The $80 was paid because that was the sum demanded and paid following the deception. The entire amount was tainted by the deception. In my opinion, a conviction based on the full amount paid on each visit to the appellant is not bad in law.
In any event, even if I were wrong to have so held, I am of the view, and here I accept the submission of the DPP, that the error relating to the sums involved is inconsequential and the conviction recorded should not be set aside in view of the provisions in s 396 of the CPC which reads as follows: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed, or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code;
(b) the want of any sanction required by section 129; 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence,
 
 
 
unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
There is no suggestion that the court whose judgment is now under appeal is not a court of competent jurisdiction. The second matter which I have to consider before applying this provision is whether the error has occasioned a failure of justice. If the appellant was prejudiced in his defence by the error, that would be an indication that there was such a failure (see 
 Pie bin Chin v PP 
 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 234
 ).
In 
 Billinghurst v Emperor 
 1924 AIR Cal 18 where the charge under s 420 of the Penal Code made no mention of the person cheated, the court held that such a failure was not fatal to the case as the accused was not misled by the omission. The court said at p 41: 
 
We are of opinion, however, that the omission should not be regarded as a fatal defect in the charge, in as much as the accused were not misled and there was no failure of justice by reason of the omission of the above-named particulars from the charge.
 
 
 
An instructive local case is 
 PP v Ginder Singh & Anor 
 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 194
  and all I need do is to quote the following passage of the judgment at p 196: 
 
The first point concerns the charge, and quite clearly the charge is wrong. Apart from the omission to state the place of the offence (s 153 of the CPC) it alleges the carrying of goods, weighing 161 cwts, 195 lbs in excess of the authorized weight of 135 cwts. Obviously the intention was to charge an excess of some 26 cwts. The poundage defeated me; the petition refers to 195 lbs; the charge to 105 lbs; and Mr Olver`s subtraction [WP2] gives 135 lbs. I should state, as regards the charge, that it does not appear to have misled the defendant-respondent, and I think it could be cured by virtue of s 422
 
 
 
In 
 Salleh v R 
 (1908) 10 SSLR 27, it was held that in determining whether any error had occasioned a failure of justice, the court was entitled to take into consideration the fact whether the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage of the proceedings.
As far as I can see, the appellant knew full well the charges he had to meet. Not only have I been unable to see any prejudice to the appellant, but for the reasons alluded to before, the appellant is the only person who would know for sure what portion of the fee paid by each patient on each visit was on account of his deception.
 Charge No 1 
I will now proceed to deal with the submission of the appellant under each charge. The evidence on this charge was that Koh Teow Hock (PW8) first came to see the appellant on 14 June 1983 because he `felt tired all over (his) body`. The appellant was recommended by a friend of PW8. The appellant used the stethoscope to examine PW8`s chest and back. Then he told PW8 that the latter had to undergo a scan. PW8 saw a blurred image on a TV-like screen which the appellant said was a `growth stuck to one of the organs` somewhere on the right side of the body just above the right hip, which PW8 understood to be the spleen. The appellant said the growth caused the tiredness and that PW8 had to get injections and medication to treat the growth and get rid of the tiredness. PW8 was told that it could take a long time, though the appellant did not say how long. He was also told to return to the appellant for an injection every day. Before the scan, a urine test was also done on PW8. On that visit, PW8 was given an injection and a day`s dosage of tablets. On the second visit the next day, he was given a blood test. He was also given an injection and some medicine. On the following visits he was given on each occasion an injection and some medicine. On 14 July 1983, a second scan was done and PW8 was told that there was slight improvement in his condition and henceforth to return on alternate days. 22 July 1983 was the last time PW8 went to see the appellant.
PW8 testified that when the appellant told him that he had a growth, he believed the appellant. As a result, PW8 `felt some fright`. A week later, the appellant even revealed to Ong Meng Keng (PW9), the friend of PW8, of what the appellant told PW8 about calcification in PW8`s body.
The appellant`s defence that he never represented to PW8 that the latter had a calcium growth in his body and that he never directed PW8 to see the appellant daily thereafter was rejected by the trial judge.
The main point raised by counsel in this appeal is that the prosecution has not proved that all the moneys paid by PW8 referred to in the charge were for the purported treatment of the growth of the calcium. Counsel argued that even if it were true that the appellant did falsely represent to PW8 that he had a growth of calcium but if the evidence showed that some of the moneys paid were for treatment properly administered to PW8, then the charge is not proven and cannot stand. Counsel submitted that the trial judge did accept that PW8 was treated for his actual ailments. In any event, in respect of the payment of $80 on the first visit on 14 June 1983, the entire payment could not be a wrongful gain to the appellant as he did not ask PW8 to come to see him; the appellant would properly be entitled to some fee for consultation, the scan and the urine test.
Secondly, counsel submitted that the evidence showed that the deception did not have any real effect on PW8 who was more concerned with his tiredness. His tiredness was the real reason why PW8 continued to see the appellant and not any misrepresentation made by the appellant.
On the first submission, I do not think there is anything more I could usefully add to what I have already said above on this point.
On the second submission, that the deception was not the effective cause, counsel relied on the following question and answer in the re-examination of PW8: 
 
Q: If you had known that there was no calcium in your spleen, would you have sought daily treatment from him?
 
 
 
 
A: I felt tiredness all over my body. There was no improvement and so I stopped going from seeing him.
  
 
 
This answer was of course not on point. But when the question was repeated to PW8, he answered: 
 
A: No. Then I would not be feeling unwell. I would not then see him. I thought the calcium in my spleen caused the tiredness because that is what he told me. I believe him.
 
 
 
Counsel further relied on 
 Khoo Kay Jin v PP 
 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 22
  which held that deception is only one element of the offence of cheating. There can be no cheating unless by reason of the deception the person deceived is induced to part with any property or to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do but for the deception.
I do not think 
 Khoo Kay Jin 
 is of much assistance; the facts are different. First, in 
 Khoo Kay Jin 
the charge did not specify the deception. Secondly, it concerned the giving of post-dated cheques (on 18 August 1962) a few days after the goods had been delivered (on 15 August 1962) and on this Hepworth J said at p 23: 
 
A post-dated cheque in payment of goods already received is a mere promise to pay on a future date and a broken promise is not a criminal offence, though it may amount in certain business relations to discreditable behaviour.
 
 
 
It was argued in 
 Khoo Kay Jin 
 that the complainant had been deceived into accepting those post-dated cheques because he believed they would be honoured; he would not have accepted them if he knew they would be dishonoured. He had, therefore, suffered damage because he had thereby foregone his right immediately to institute civil proceedings. Hepworth J responded to this argument in these terms: 
 
The answer to this argument is in my view that the damage spoken of must be the proximate result of that complained of. If it is a mere possibility and not a necessary consequence of the act an essential element of the offence of cheating is not satisfied.
 
 
 
Another case relied upon by counsel is 
 R v Clucas 
 
[1949] 2 KB 226
, where the accused and another induced bookmakers to bet with them by representing that they were commission agents acting on behalf of a large number of workmen who were placing small bets on various races when in fact they were making bets in considerable sums of money for themselves alone. The bookmaker made payment on the winning horse. Goddard CJ, on behalf of a full bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal, after observing that the accused and the other person were thoroughly dishonest people, said: 
 
In the opinion of the court it is impossible to say that there was an obtaining of the money by false pretences which were alleged because the money was obtained not by reason of the fact that the people falsely pretended that they were somebody else or acting in some capacity which they were not; it was obtained because they backed a winning horse and the bookmaker paid because the horse had won. No doubt the bookmaker might never have opened an account with these men if he had known the true facts, but we must distinguish in this case between one contributing cause and the effective cause which led the bookmaker to pay the money.
 
 
 
The last case cited by counsel and which I would like to refer to is the unreported case of 
 R v Lewis 
 (unreported), which is mentioned in 
 Russell on Crime 
(12th Ed) at p 1186. There a school-mistress had obtained her appointment by falsely stating that she possessed a teacher`s certificate. The court held that she was not guilty of obtaining her month`s salary by false pretences on the ground that she was paid because of the services she rendered and not because of the falsehood.
Each of these cases was decided on its own facts. But it seems to me that the correct principle of law is set out in 
 Russell on Crime 
(12th Ed) at p 1184: 
 
It is necessary for the prosecution to establish that it was by some of the false pretences laid in the indictment that the goods were obtained ... If the position was that the prosecutor (ie victim) at the time when he transferred the goods, was influenced by the false pretence and would not have transferred them but for his reliance upon it, then 
 it is immaterial that he may have had additional reasons
 for making the transfer. (Emphasis is mine.)
 
 
 
In 
 R v Lince 
 (1873) 12 Cox CC 451, it was decided that the fact that the false pretence was not the only reason why the victim parted with his property was quite immaterial. Bovill CJ said at p 453: 
 
The second point reserved was whether a charge of obtaining goods by false pretences can be sustained when the prosecutor admits that another circumstance influenced his mind in parting with his goods, as well as the alleged false pretence. It has long been settled that it is immaterial that the prosecutor was influenced by other circumstances than the false pretence charged. If that were not so, an indictment for false pretences could scarcely ever be maintained, as a tradesman is generally more or less influenced by the profit he expects to make upon the transaction.
 
 
 
 
 
 R v Lince 
 
 is cited in 
 Gour`s Penal Code of India 
(10th Ed) Vol 4 at p 3648 as representing good law. The authors state further at p 3690 the following: 
 
To attract the application of s 420, however, it is not necessary that the representations made by the accused should be the sole cause of the damage or loss. It is sufficient if the complainant was partly and materially, though not entirely, influenced by the false pretences of the accused.
 
 
 
Reverting to the present charge, the trial judge found that PW8 accepted what the appellant said about calcification and accepted whatever treatment was administered to him by the appellant and promptly paid for each treatment under the belief that all that was aimed at treating the growth, and that in turn would alleviate the tiredness that was afflicting PW8. After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge came to the conclusion that: 
 
... as far as PW8 was concerned he had been induced to believe that the treatment he was receiving all along was in relation to the `growth of calcium` in one of his organs with the consequent elimination of his `aches and weakness`. Although in the course of his visits to the appellant`s clinic he may have been treated for other conditions described by the appellant, what was always foremost in his mind, through its promotion by the appellant, was that he was being treated for his `aches and weaknesses`.
 
 
 
In my view, there is ample evidence to show that the deception did have a real effect on PW8 who returned daily to seek treatment from the appellant and paid for the fees demanded by the appellant. While it might be true that PW8`s main concern was his tiredness, the fact remains that the appellant did deceive PW8 into believing that the tiredness was because of the `growth`. He did ask PW8 to return daily for treatment. Putting it at the lowest, the case falls within the principle established in 
 R v Lince 
 (1873) 12 Cox CC 451
 . 
 Charge No 2 
The evidence was that on 30 July 1983, Mdm Teo Guek Eng (PW4) brought her daughter Chan Yin Ling (PW5) to see the appellant. PW4 told the appellant that PW5 had pains on the joints and had been treated by a Chinese physician, who told her that PW5`s kidneys were weak. PW4 also informed the appellant that she found some white sediments in the urine sample of PW5. Using the ultra-sound machine, the appellant did a scan of PW5`s kidneys. Based on one of the images that appeared on the screen, the appellant told PW4 that it showed a kidney with a protrusion. The appellant said that that kidney was `no good`. On enquiry by PW4, the appellant advised that the kidney could be cured. He told PW4 that she was to bring PW5 to him for an injection every day for two weeks to ensure a speedy recovery. On that day the appellant also carried out a urine test on PW5. PW4 complied with that advice and brought PW5 to the appellant for the next two weeks.
PW4 did not make a request for the scan. The appellant suggested it and PW4 did not object. The present charge related to ten visits by PW5 to the appellant. The last visit was on 20 August 1983. Thereafter on a relative`s recommendation, PW4 brought PW5 to see a specialist. PW4 had then also heard from another patient who said that a taxi driver had remarked that the appellant was a cheat.
On 24 August 1983, PW4 brought PW5 to see Dr Gordon Ku at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After examination and tests, Dr Ku advised PW4 that PW5 did not have any kidney trouble. He also said her urine was clear.
Counsel submitted that the appellant did not dishonestly induce PW5 to undergo the scanning procedure on 30 July 1983; that the sum for the scanning was properly incurred. Alternatively, he submitted that as the appellant had in fact treated PW5 for her true ailment as diagnosed by him, irrespective of whether or not PW4 and/or PW5 had any such knowledge, there was no wrongful loss or wrongful gain.
It is true that when the appellant told PW4 and PW5 that he would do the scan, no deception had yet been uttered. But whether the scan was at all necessary and was properly undertaken must be looked at in the light of all the circumstances. PW4 and PW5 are lay people who believed that PW5 might have kidney trouble. Thus they came to consult the appellant. But surely before the appellant did a scan he must be satisfied through clinical examination that such a scan was necessary. After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge found that the appellant had no good reason to order a scan. I cannot see any ground to disapprove of that finding. Accordingly, it could not be said that the fee for the scan was properly due to the appellant. In any event, even if what counsel submitted is correct, that some fee was properly due for the scan, the total amount paid by PW4 on the first visit would have included a portion which was due to the deception. That being the case, and for the reasons I gave above, the entire amount of the fee paid on 30 July 1983 was tainted. As for the subsequent visits, even though the appellant might have treated PW5 for her actual ailment, the fact remains that PW4 and PW5 returned to the appellant because of the deception. The fact situation here is quite different from that in 
 R v Clucas 
 and 
 R v Lewis 
.
 Charge No 3 
On 13 July 1983, Wong Sheue Ling (PW7) was brought by her mother, Madam Loy Boon Siew (PW6), to see the appellant because PW7 had blood in her motion and also pain in her stomach. Then using the ultra-sound machine on the abdomen of PW7, the appellant said that there was a growth in the large intestine of PW7 and that it was serious. PW6 believed him. He told PW6 that PW7 had to return to his clinic for injection and medicine for two weeks. On the visit of 19 July 1983, following a second scan, the appellant told PW6 that the growth was still there. PW6 suggested that perhaps PW7 should have an X-ray done. The appellant gave a letter of referral to PW6. On 21 July 1983, PW6 brought PW7 to the American Hospital for that purpose. A barium enema test was carried out at the hospital. PW6 brought the X-ray film and the radiologist`s report to the appellant who after seeing them told PW6 that there was no growth in the large intestine of PW7. PW6 was angry and asked why the appellant in the beginning said there was a growth. In reply, the appellant denied that he ever told PW6 that PW7 had such a growth. Notwithstanding this deception, PW6 continued to bring PW7 to the appellant for a period of almost one month from 22 July to 19 August 1983 in regard to PW7`s original ailment. PW6 stopped bringing PW7 to the appellant after 19 August 1983 because PW7`s condition did improve. She had also heard remarks from others that the appellant was a cheat.
The submission of counsel on this charge is that the alleged deception, ie growth in the large intestine, had little or no effect on PW6; otherwise, why did PW6 continue to bring PW7 to see the appellant after the deception was exposed? That goes to show that the `alleged deception was not foremost in the mind of PW6`. After all, the appellant did treat PW7 for her blood-in-motion and stomach pain problem.
I should mention that through the trial itself, counsel for the appellant had also made a similar point, ie that if, in fact, PW6 felt cheated by the appellant, she would not have calmly put the matter aside and continued to bring PW7 to see the appellant for PW7`s original ailment.
Having reviewed the evidence, I am unable to accept the submission that the deception did little or had no effect on PW6. She was informed specifically by the appellant to attend daily at his clinic with PW7 for injection and medicine in relation to the growth in the large intestine. PW6 complied with that advice. The senior district judge dealt with this very point as follows (pp 92-94 of the grounds of decision): 
 
The fact that she had dutifully attended daily at the accused`s clinic with PW7, for the treatment of the latter by the appellant, was in the main motivated by her expectation that the appellant could do something about the `growth` in the first instance and consequently, about the rest of the ailment of PW7. In fact, when the appellant prescribed tablets for PW7 on the first day, ie 13 July 1983, after having impressed PW6 about the existence of the `growth`, the appellant had informed her (PW6) that the tablets were for the `growth` in question and also to stop the bleeding which came about when PW7 moved her bowels (vide: p 265, notes of evidence). Furthermore, what was also significant was that the dosage of tablets prescribed for PW7 by the appellant on each visit was sufficient for only a day. The question that instantly arose was that if such tablets were necessary for treating PW7, why then was it at all necessary for PW7 to return daily to the appellant`s clinic (to receive the daily dosage) when a course of such tablets to last say, five or six days at a time, could instead have been prescribed, obviating any necessity for the daily attendances? Even if the reason for this procedure was that it was necessary because PW7 had to receive daily injections as well, it still did not explain the need for a daily dosage of the tablets in question. The tablets could still have been prescribed in a course for a period. Similarly, the evidence of Dr Teh (PW17) with regard to the medication and injections prescribed as outlined in the appellant`s case sheet on PW7, exh p 221, was that the injections of Bactrium administered by the appellant to PW7 on certain days were unnecessary in view of the prescription of Bactrium tablets that PW7 took on those same days (vide: p 758, notes of evidence). From all these circumstances, there were no doubts in my mind that both PW6 and PW7 were indeed telling the truth when they stated that the appellant had specificall y told them that for PW7 to be treated for her `growth`, she had to come to see him at his clinic daily for two weeks for injections and medication, which in fact they did until 20 July 1983 (in respect of the `growth`).
 
 
 
I am also unable to accept the submission that the senior district judge did not give sufficient consideration to the fact that PW6 kept sending her daughter (PW7) back to the appellant for treatment on the original ailments (blood-in-stool and abdominal pain) even after 21 July 1983. The senior district judge clearly had this aspect in mind but he was not persuaded by that fact. Instead, he was of the view that the subsequent visits should not `detract from the weight to be attached to (PW6`s) allegation of what she claimed the appellant had represented to her about the ""growth"" on her first visit to his clinic`. He explained: 
 
This is because her subsequent visits did not include treatment of any `growth` in PW7 but was continued for the specific purpose of having the other ailments of PW7, namely, the blood in her stools and the abdominal pains, which still persisted, to be attended to.
 
 
 
It is important to understand this part of the evidence of PW6. She put it this way: 
 
I felt the appellant was contradicting himself. At that moment I was angry. So as far as this matter concerning the growth is concerned, I put it aside.
 
 
 
The senior district judge found as a fact that the appellant did misrepresent to PW6 and PW7 regarding the growth and because of this deception they returned to obtain treatment for the growth until 20 July 1983. Visits, subsequent to 20 July 1983, made by PW6 and PW7 were not included in the charge. The fact that PW6 had (notwithstanding her anger at that moment) reacted more kindly and with less hostility towards the appellant, to the extent that she was prepared to forget about the past, does not necessarily mean that the deception did not have any real effect on her. We are here dealing with a lay person who seems to have an abiding trust in doctors. PW6 would appear to be one of those people who, notwithstanding an earlier disappointment, would prefer to stick by a doctor rather than consulting another.
Finally, the point was made that the trial judge had erroneously held that the appellant `had deliberately given (PW7) a medication that would worsen the (stool condition)`. This point was considered by the senior district judge at pp 226-232 of his grounds of decision. PW7 had a condition of blood-in-stool and her stools were pellet-like. Yet the appellant said that he was informed by PW6 that PW7 had diarrhoea, which the appellant diagnosed to be `amoebic dysentery`. The trial judge did not believe the appellant that the appellant was informed that PW7 had diarrhoea and held that he must have known of PW7`s primary complaint, ie constipated stools. To the extent that the trial judge seems to think that Immodium (a drug to control diarrhoea) was prescribed by the appellant prior to 21 July 1983, that appears to be wrong: see exh P211. Immodium was only prescribed on 21 July 1983 and subsequently. But I do not think this error materially affects the other findings of the trial judge. However, the trial judge was right to observe that even after the radiologist`s report from the American Hospital showed that PW7 had a `large amount of faecal residue`, the appellant prescribed Immodium.
 Charge No 4 
On this charge, the deception which was alleged against the appellant was that he told the patient Madam Chua Chay Chim (PW10) that she was suffering from kidney trouble. On 25 July 1983, PW10 went to see the appellant because her right leg, near the ankle, was swollen. She also informed him that some elderly, but lay people, had advised her that she might be suffering from kidney disease. The appellant gave her an ultra-sound scan. Then the appellant told her that one of her kidneys was big and the other small and that she had kidney trouble. On being asked for a cure, the appellant told PW10 that if she wanted a fast cure she should see him daily for three weeks, which she did. On the third visit on 27 July 1983, the appellant examined PW10`s vagina. She did not ask him why, thinking he was a doctor and knew what he was doing. Neither did he inform her. But PW10 thought it might be related to her kidneys; after all she had not gone to see the appellant for any other ailment. The appellant told her that her uterus was dirty and needed toilet. On subsequent visits she was given vaginal toilet and treated for an ailment related to her cervix. A cauterization of the cervix and a polypectomy were also performed. But PW10 was never told what those treatments were all about.
PW10 stopped seeing the appellant after 20 August 1983 as she had lost faith in him; the swelling on the ankle had still not subsided even though the appellant said it would be healed in three weeks` time. PW10 said she believed the appellant when he told her that she had kidney trouble. She elaborated: 
 
I thought that the swelling in my ankle was caused by my kidney problem and that is why I returned daily to receive treatment for this problem of mine.
 
 
 
PW10 admitted that it would be difficult for her to do the vaginal toilet herself; as she had to return daily to the clinic, it would be convenient for the appellant and his nurse to do that for her. But all that was pursuant to the appellant`s initial advice to her that she should see him daily for three weeks because of the alleged kidney trouble.
Counsel`s first point is that a substantial part of the fee which PW10 paid on the first visit was lawfully due to the appellant; further, in respect of the subsequent visits for which treatment was given relating to her cervix, proper deduction should be allowed in respect thereof. He also contended that the treatment which the appellant gave relating to the cervix had nothing to do with the deception.
Now PW10 clearly stated that she thought the examination of her vagina and subsequent treatment of it related to the alleged kidney trouble. The trial judge`s finding on this is as follows: 
 
I was aware that the appellant did actually treat PW10 for an ailment relating to her cervix. However, the manner by which PW10 was induced to subject herself for the treatment of that ailment was, in my view, dishonest. She was never told that the treatment that was being administered to her had nothing to do with the swelling of her ankle nor with any kidney trouble, but rather was led to believe that it was.
 
 
 
After reviewing the defence put up by the appellant, the trial judge concluded: 
 
I was satisfied that the accused had so acted with the clear knowledge that PW10 would believe what he had represented to her, which she did, and thereafter he had purported to treat her for the `kidney trouble` when in fact he was treating her for cervicitis and erosion, for which she had not come to see him about in the first place. In the circumstances, it was my view that even if his treatment of PW10, during the material period, for something other than `kidney trouble` was borne out medically, it was irrelevant in so far as a defence to the prosecution`s case on the present charge is concerned. The fact of the matter was that PW10 was deceived into believing what he had told her about her swellings and while acting under such a belief, had been dishonestly induced into parting with her money (totalling $652) to the accused.
 
 
 
I am satisfied that the initial deception created by the appellant had caused PW10 to return for further treatment and also to allow treatment to be carried out in relation to her vagina. All the payments which she made to the appellant were affected by the deception. The fact that the appellant had actually treated her for her cervicitis does not render what he did any less culpable. There is no basis for me to disturb the conviction recorded by the trial judge.
 Charge Nos 5 and 6 
These two charges concerned one Siow Lye Kwee (PW2) and his wife, Madam Tjhiu Tjoen Mie (PW3), who went to the appellant`s clinic to check for the presence of sugar in their urine. They gave a specimen of their urine to the nurse. They were subsequently called into the consultation room to see the appellant, who greeted them in the most extraordinary manner: `Wah, wah, you are a very sick person and both of you are suffering different sicknesses.` The appellant further said that PW2`s urine showed a lot of blood and PW3`s urine showed a lot of pus. He told them that PW2`s case could be `kidney trouble` and PW3`s case could be `uterus trouble`. Both were asked to go through a blood test. They were also asked to return the next day which they did.
Counsel`s main point is that PW2 and PW3 went on their own accord to see the appellant to have their urine tested. The appellant did carry out a urine test on them. Assuming that the appellant did deceive them by making them believe that they were very sick persons and on that pretext carried out a blood test, the fact remains that the appellant did render them services, ie urine test, for which he was entitled to some fee. That amount should have been deducted in formulating the charge.
This submission is similar to those made earlier on the other charges and for the reasons which I have already dealt with, I do not think there is any merit in it.
 Appeal dismissed 
In the light of the foregoing, the appeal against conviction must be dismissed. I turn next to deal with the question of sentence. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months for each charge and as required by s 18 of the CPC, two of the sentences were ordered to be served consecutively.
For this court to interfere with the sentence imposed by the court below, it must be shown that the sentence passed is manifestly excessive. The offence under s 420 of the Code carries a maximum sentence of seven years` imprisonment plus fine. Counsel for the appellant has not submitted that the court below has either committed an error of principle or taken into account irrelevant considerations.
I have given this matter the most anxious consideration as it involves a member of one of the noble professions. The charges relate to six patients and they stretched over a period of more than three months; it is not just an isolated instance of indiscretion. What seems to me clear is that by the use of the ultra-sound scanning machine the appellant had proceeded systematically to defraud those patients by falsely and dishonestly representing to them that they had a particular disease (eg kidney trouble, growth in the large intestines) which they in fact did not have. The machine was obviously his tool to impress and convince the patients that what he said was true. Taking advantage of their ignorance and trust, the appellant made them attend at his clinic regularly. The motive of the appellant was obviously to ensure that these people became regular patients so that he could earn more fees from them; that was what the trial judge found. These patients trusted him and did not suspect anything was awry. He had no regard whatsoever for the fears and anxieties which his dishonest representations had caused to his patients. He had no qualms in creating misery for them. He has abused a position of trust. Such conduct cannot be tolerated without the public`s confidence in the medical profession being undermined. What he has done is mean and despicable. He has brought shame to the profession which has always been held in high esteem by the public.
I appreciate that following this case, the appellant will be dealt with professionally by the Medical Council. But a doctor who cheats his patients, like the appellant, must expect to be dealt with according to law as well as the disciplinary rules of his profession. I am unable to accept this as a mitigating factor. In 
 R v Barrick 
 (1985) 7 Cr App R (S) 142; (1985) 81 Cr A pp R 78, the court indicated that professional men should expect to be punished as severely as others, in some cases more severely.
I note that the sums involved in all the six charges totalled only about $2,500. But having considered all the circumstances, while I think that the sentence imposed by the senior district judge is stern, and stern it should be to register society`s reproach, I am not persuaded that it is manifestly excessive. Accordingly, the appeal against sentence is also dismissed.
Lest it be misunderstood, I would like to stress that this is not a case of a doctor who made a bona fide mistake in diagnosis. This court recognizes that doctors, like any one else, could make mistakes in their professional practice. I need hardly say that a mistake made in good faith is no crime. Whether there will be civil liability for such a mistake is a separate matter altogether. I am not concerned with that at this time. But here I am not dealing with a case of judgmental errors made in good faith but deliberate fraud in making representations to patients knowing full well that those representations were false. There seems to be a certain pattern about it. The senior district judge has, in his very detailed grounds of decision, carefully examined the evidence and found that the appellant had perpetrated fraud.

1          Two suits filed in the years 2000 and 2001 will be covered by this judgment. The first suit No. 880/2000/A was filed on 20 October 2002 by Adventure Training Systems (Asia-Pacific) Pte Ltd (“the Contractors”) who claim against Signature Lifestyle Pte Ltd (“the Managers”) for the balance of the contract price of $250,361.00 payable under an agreement in writing entered into between them and dated 28 July 1999 for the design, supply and installation of the structures of the Adventure Training Facility at the Ubin Adventure Centre which was operated as a resort by Ubin Lagoon Resort Pte Ltd (“the Operators”). The construction contract of the resort in Pulau Ubin was signed by the Managers, though it was at all material times operated by the Operators. After the filing of the first suit, a lady Ms Lim Yee Ming, Ivy (“Ivy”), who participated in the outdoor adventure program in the resort, was seriously injured on 15 December 2000 while she was being lowered by an employee of the Operator in an outdoor adventure structure known as ‘the Pyramid’. Ivy filed a separate action in Suit No. 1368 of 2001. Ivy claims damages for negligence against the Operators, the Contractors and Adventure Training Systems Pty Ltd (“the Suppliers”). The suppliers are a company incorporated in Australia and they had supplied the Rescue Kit comprising , inter alia, the SRTE stop descender and the prussic loop to the Contractors.
 
2          Underlying the two actions is the central allegation of the Managers and the Operators that these two pieces of equipment, which were used by the employee in question of the Operators to lower Ivy in the Pyramid, were defective by reason of which Ivy was dropped from a height of some 8 to 10 metres, falling heavily to the ground. The other central allegation is that the Contractors’ subcontractors, the Suppliers, had failed to ensure that the prussic loop was properly in place to act as the fall-back secondary speed control mechanism and that the Suppliers had failed to train the instructors of the Operators properly in the use of the prussic loop.
3          Ivy suffered multiple rib fractures, a fractured dislocation of the T8 vertebra and the burst fracture of the T12 vertebra resulting in paralysis from the waist down and the loss of bowels and bladder control. 
4          Consequently, the Managers counterclaim against the Contractors for an order that the Contractors and the Suppliers indemnify them and save them harmless from all claims for damages of Ivy by reason of their breaches of their contractual breaches of contract and/or tortious breaches of duty of care owed to them and to Ivy in connection with the fall. These counterclaims are in addition to the usual defences and claims for set-offs arising out of their breaches of the contract for the supply of equipment and training of the employees to be skillful instructors of customers of the resort who take part in the challenging and somewhat hazardous outdoor activities in the resort.
5          Given the fact that the injuries were sustained by Ivy after the commencement of the first suit, it was not surprising that the issues in the suit became far more complicated. They expanded from contractual issues to issues in the law of negligence. After preliminary investigations following Ivy’s most unfortunate injuries, they came to the view that the stop descender might be defective and could have failed to perform the function it was designed and held out to perform. Later, they also came to the view that the prussic loop was not properly rigged up. Still later, after further investigations, they also came to the view that the training of the instructors in the employ of the Managers by the Contractors or their sub-contractors, could have been negligent because the training in the use of the prussic loop, the other equipment in the rescue kit, did  not in terms of its rigging or set-up and in term of handling by the staff of the Operators,  comply with the demands of safety.
6          It was therefore inevitable that after the commencement of the trial of the first suit, which began on 9 April, 2001, the defendants obtained leave to join the Suppliers as a third party. In view of the fact that the Suppliers were incorporated in Australia, the service of the Third Party Notice had to be served out of jurisdiction. The entire process, which was procedurally in effect much like a new action, unavoidably took time despite rigorous case management by the Registrar of the Supreme Court. The third tranche of the trial of the first suit only resumed on 11 Sep 2002 by which time this court was once again constrained to re-read the trial record and many affidavits in chief yet again. Due to the fact that the defendants had to investigate the causes of the accident, they needed more time to procure the necessary evidence. In the result, it took 11 days of trial to explore the issues arising out of the first suit. In that suit, much of the evidence about the equipment and training were led. Judgment had to be held over pending the disposal of the second suit in which Ivy’s claims on liability and quantum of damages could be dealt with.
7          As noted earlier, the second suit was filed by Ivy against the Operators, the Contractors and the Suppliers for damages for negligence. To save time traversing over what could not sensibly be contested, parties were encouraged to come to an agreement on the non-controversial facts. They sensibly filed a statement of Agreed Facts. They also agreed that the evidence adduced during the trial of the first suit are relevant and are to be admitted for the purposes of deciding the second suit. Further, all the defendants in the second suit agreed that Ivy was not at all at fault in the incident which caused her the serious injuries. Each of the defendants was either negligent or contributorily negligent. The trial of the second suit began on 13 January 2003 and it went on for 4 days, after which written submissions were all filed by 25 February 2003. I now deliver judgment on the issues raised in the two suits, except those relating to the claims for work done and materials supplied under the agreement of 28 July 1999 entered into between the Contractors and the Managers and the Managers’ contractual counterclaims in connection with those claims. Those matters will be dealt with in a separate judgment under suit No. 880/2000A.
Agreed Facts
8          Amongst the facilities offered by the Operators at the resort was the Ubin Adventure Centre where the Operators had recently begun conducting adventure and recreational activities for their customers. 
9          Ivy was at the material times an employee of Trans-Link Express Pte Ltd. They were a paying customer of the Operator at the resort on Pulau Ubin and had engaged their services to conduct the adventure and recreational activities for employees such as Ivy. 
10        I was told and it was accepted by parties concerned without further enquiry that the Operators were covered by a Public Liabilities Insurance Policy issued by QBE Insurance (International) Ltd (“QBE”) who appointed the firm of solicitors Madhavan Partnership to act for the Operators in the second suit. The Managers as well as a sister company of the Operators were at all material times named as the insured under the said policy.
11        On 15 December 2000, Ivy and other employees of Trans-Link Express Pte Ltd were taking part in the ‘Team Pyramid Challenge’ at the Ubin Adventure Centre, pursuant to the agreement with the Operators. The final challenge, which the participants of the ‘Team Pyramid Challenge’ were supposed to participate in, was an activity called the ‘Flying Fox’, which involved by belaying a descent from the top of the 24m-high tower.
12        Ivy was in the same group as Kwok Kam Wing Barry (“Barry”), Jack Joshua Tan Kiang Heng (“Jack”), Fredrick Ngnasegkar (“Frederick”) and a lady from an overseas office called Debbie. An instructor of the Ubin Adventure Centre, Ben Choo Chee Keong (“Ben”) was assigned to be in charge of the group.
13        When Ivy’s group was going up the tower, it started to rain heavily. Ben told the group that they could not carry on and that he had to lower them to the ground using the lowering equipment, which, as stated earlier included a stop descender and the prussic loop.
14        Frederick was the first person in the group to be lowered by Ben using the lowering equipment. The descent was uneventful and, in my judgment, Ben successfully executed it.
15        While Ivy was being lowered by Ben, she suddenly dropped from a height of approximately 10 metres without warning or restraint, falling heavily to the ground. As a result of the fall, Ivy suffered severe injuries including being paralysed from the waist down. She also lost bladder and bowel control. She was hospitalized from 15 December 2000 to 15 March 2001. All parties agreed that the incident would not have occurred under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of negligence. No negligence is alleged against Ivy by any of the defendants in both suits.
16        The issue on liability is whether negligence could be attributed to any of the defendants solely or contributed to by any other of the defendants in both suits.
The Background
17        The building of the Adventure Training facility, as noted earlier, was carried out under a written agreement on 28 July 1999 and entered into between the Managers and the Contractors. The Contractors commenced work in August 1999. They informed the managers that the training facilities were practically completed on 11 April 2000. Prior to the practical completion date, the various structures and facilities were progressively handed over to the Managers. The Contractors could not hand over the whole site because as of 11 April 2000 the Managers’ other contractors and agents had not completed the ground works for the parachute jump.
18        Under the agreement the Contractors provided the Managers 6 pieces of the Pyramid Rescue Kit. The Contractors had in turn purchased the said rescue kit from the Suppliers. The 6 Pyramid Rescue Kits were delivered to the Managers on 12 May 2000, apparently in good order and condition.
19        Pursuant to the said agreement, the Contractors arranged for the Suppliers to provide 10 of the Managers’ and Operators’ staff a 12-day comprehensive “train the trainer program”. Under the program it was intended to teach and train 10 of the Managers’ and Operators’ staff (who may be referred to as “the trainers” or the “instructors”) in the proper use of the equipment, which the Contractors sold to the managers. The training included safety procedures.
20        In April 2000 the Contractors arranged for Mr Richard Hope, the Managing Director and representative of the Suppliers, to conduct the training program. The training was conducted in May 2000.
21        The issues of fact turn on the questions whether the incident was due entirely to Ben’s error or did the Contractors and Suppliers contribute to its occurrence or whether the Contractors and the Suppliers were singly liable or contributorily liable for the incident by reason of the defective stop descender or the prussic loop and their training of the Operators staff in the use of both equipment.
The Operators’ version
22        Ben, an employee of the Operators, told the court that on 15 December 2000 twenty of the staff of Trans-Link Express Pte Ltd proceeded to the Team Challenge Pyramid for the team building exercise. They were divided into 4 groups of 5 participants each. Ben and 3 of the other instructors briefed them. He was in charge of Group 3. Each group was taught how to use the Team Challenge Pyramid colour strops. These strops were to prevent a participant from falling from the pyramid. When a group has successful climbed to the top of the pyramid, each participant would descend to the ground by using the ‘flying fox’, a belaying system.
23        According to Ben, at about 1330 hours, it started to rain at the adventure center. At about 1500 hours the rain was very heavy and instructions were given to cease all activities on the pyramid. There was thunder and lightning. When the instructions to stop all activities were given, Group 3 were in the second level resting cage of the pyramid. That was about 9.5 metres above the ground. Ben had to use the rescue kit, which comprised amongst others the stop descender and the prussic loop) to activate the emergency descent.
24        Ben prepared Frederick for the descent by clipping the steel karabiner onto Frederick’s safety harness. The karabiner is attached to a belaying rope, which is held by the stop descender.  The stop descender was in turn attached to the pyramid structure. At the other end of the belaying rope was attached the prussic loop. The other end of the prussic loop was attached to a steel karabiner which was in turn clipped onto the instructor’s harness. The prussic loop is a back-up jamming cord which served the same function of the stop descender, i.e. to stop and regulate the participants descent while being lowered to the ground by the instructor. The rope used for the stop descender was a 9mm diameter static rope.
25        By design, and as Ben stated in para 6 of his affidavit evidence, where the stop descender fails to jam the static rope, the prussic loop has to be pulled to an acute angle and the knot of the prussic loop would immediately tighten around the static belaying rope and jam the belaying rope, thereby stopping a participant’s descent.
26        Ben lowered the first participant, Frederick, by controlling the stop descender. Ben in evidence said that without applying any pressure from him on the lever of the stop descender, the static rope was locked by the stop descender. The rope could not move, and Frederick could not descend. By gently squeezing the lever of the stop descender ‘co-ordinated with the sliding of the prussic loop through the static rope’, Frederick was lowered to the ground by Ben basically gently pressing the lever of the stop descender and paying out the static rope through the knot of the prussic loop.
27        After Frederick was lowered to the ground, Ben began to prepare the stop descender and the prussic loop. The static rope had to be pulled through the stop descender, with the tail end of the rope getting longer until the optimum length was achieved. He told Ivy to relax and sit back on her safety harness. She was told to hold the ‘figure 8’ knot using both her hands. She was also instructed to spread both legs to shoulder-width apart and to lock both knees.
28        Following Ben’s directions, Ivy bent her body to a seating position. After lifting her 2 feet off the Jacob’s Ladder to descend, Ben saw that the static rope suddenly began to run right through the stop descender. Ben throughout the trial insisted that without any movement or pressure on the lever of the stop descender, the stop descender failed to lock and jam the static rope. Ben said that the prussic loop, which was by design a back-up jamming device, also failed to jam and stop the rope from sliding through.
29        Each of the staff of the Operators who had witnessed the incident filed a report of the incident. An Incident Report was filed. It was alleged that the stop descender failed to hold up Ivy when the lever was not pressed.
30        On 17 December 2000 the Contractors’ Mr Russell Moy came to Ubin Adventure Centre in response to the report of the incident by Gabriel Soh. Both he and Gabriel Soh proceeded to test and investigate the rescue kit. Many permutations were tested, including while the 9mm rope was wet and when dry. 9mm and 11mm ropes were used. Dry and wet ropes were used. The preliminary conclusion of Russell Moy was that the stop descender could not work with the 9mm ropes or that the stop descender was defective. According to Gabriel Soh, it was found that the stop descender and prussic loop had failed in all cases.
31        Mr Russell Moy, experienced in dealing with adventure equipment, stated in his letter of 18 Dec 2000 that he had “observed several demonstrations by the Ubin Resort Staff with the descender in every possible orientation and had both wet rope and dry ropes supplied with the rescue kits. The descender failed completely in all cases. We noted that the rope was inserted correctly to the diagram shown on the descender. When set the system up with 11mm rope and the system worked with no failure. We also observed  the prussic knot in the system as a backup, this worked when operated correctly.” Unfortunately, the Contractors failed to call Russell Moy as a witness and there was no explanation at all for his absence from the witness stand. The Contractors had recorded the tests on video tapes. Again unfortunately, those tapes were produced and said to be blanks. 
32        On 9 January 2001, Mr Richard Delaney of the Suppliers came to Ubin Adventure Centre to investigate the stop descender and the prussic loop. He conducted tests. Gabriel Soh said in evidence that Mr Delaney confirmed that his conclusion was also that the 9mm rope used would and had failed to activate the stop descender. He had used a video camera during the tests to record the events on video tape. On his return to Australia, Mr Delaney was supposed to furnish a written report to the Managers and Operators his findings and conclusions. Despite a written  reminder from the Contractors dated 23 December 2001, Mr Delaney who investigated into the matter failed to submit his report to the Operators, Managers and the Contractors.
33        On the second day of the trial, Ben gave a demonstration of how he had used the stop descender and the prussic loop on the day in question. Both equipment, which were used during the incident, were produced for inspection. The stop descender used is the SRTE (Single Rope Technique Equipment) model known as D1a. It is described as a single rope stop descender. The belaying rope is passed through a metal camming device. When the lever is not pressed, the camming device could pressed against the loaded belaying rope and prevent it from slipping through. To release the rope from the camming friction, the lever should be gently pressed. The more the lever is squeezed the faster the descent would be. On page 25 of the manufacturer’s manual, it is advised that “(t)he right hand of the instructor must control the tail end of the rope at all times”. The left hand of the instructor gently squeezes the lever to start the descent.
34        Ben demonstrated that his left hand was on the stop descender and his right hand was holding the prussic loop. He told me that when Ivy fell his right hand was still holding prussic loop. He did not move away his right hand. His right hand was holding on to the knot of the prussic loop and on that scenario the tail end of the static rope could continue to pay out. If he had let go his right hand, the knot of the prussic loop would have tightened when the prussic loop is pulled and if the tail end of the rope is pulled the descent would have stopped. It should be borne in mind that the prussic loop is locked onto Ben’s harness by means of a karabiner. It was all very sudden. Ivy fell within a matter of a second or so.
35        Ben and Gabriel Soh, the Head of the adventure center and Assistant General Manager of the Operators overseeing the training of the instructors, told me during the demonstration that Richard Hope, the director of the Contractors who trained the instructors of the Operators on the use of the rescue kit, had repeatedly assured the instructors that the stop descender would be 100% effective. Gabriel Soh further told the court that during the tests he required a fail-safe mechanism to be put in place in addition to the stop descender. On 17 December 2000 whilst the tests were conducted in the presence of Mr Richard Hope, the stop descender again failed and Gabriel Soh had a free fall. Fortunately, one of the instructors had acted as the belayer who would break any free fall. That instructor broke the fall like breaking the fall of a mountain climber.
36        Mr Lee Tuck Hume, the Assistant Operations Manager of the adventure center and an instructor at the center, gave evidence on the training by Mr Richard Hope. He said that he and 8 other instructors, including Ben, attended the training sessions conducted in May 2000. They were taught that after the static rope had been fitted through the stop descender, the tail end of the rope should be directed downwards. Mr Richard Hope also taught them that if there was a slack in the prussic loop, it was acceptable and could be continued to be used. They were told that when there was rapid descent, the running static rope would drag the prussic loop knot up to be in contact with the stop descender. As a result, they were taught, that the running static rope would be stopped. Ben in cross examination confirmed the evidence of Lee Tuck Hume in material respects. Mr Omar Rosli, Ms Denise Oi and Ms Chua Hwee Bin, who were instructors of the Operators and trained by Mr Richard Hope, confirmed the evidence of Mr Lee Tuck Hume’s evidence. Ms Chua, however, qualified her confirmation by saying  that she could not remember whether Mr Hope said it was alright for the prussic loop to have a slack or that the running of the static rope would drag the prussic loop up to be in contact with the stop descender. If these were in fact taught by Mr Richard Hope, they would be entirely wrong. 
37        The demonstrations in court showed conclusively that an instructor should with his right hand hold the knot not too tightly when the static rope was paying out during a descent and that the knot and the tail end of the rope should be held firmly by the right hand if descent was to be stopped. I had tested the use of the prussic loop in simulated conditions. It was quite easy simply to tighten the grip of the right hand on both the knot and the tail end of the rope. Those actions would effectively without much difficulty stop a descent. Ben in cross examination confirmed these observations. It was also demonstrably shown that, alternatively, the instructor could let off the knot of the prussic loop and the tail end of the rope and the prussic loop on being dragged up would become taut because the knot would tighten its grip around the tail end rope. It must be noted that the prussic loop must be short enough for it to tighten before the knot of the prussic loop reaches and abuts the stop descender.
38        Mr Matthew Scott gave expert evidence for the Operators and Managers. He was a Manager involved in the business of constructing adventure equipment and providing adventure skills training. His credentials as an expert were not challenged. He observed that the stop descender was supplied to the Operators and Managers fully assembled. He opened it to examine it. He found that there was a pivot bolt nut, which could be adjusted and set to correspond with the belay rope to be used. He found that the stop descender in question would best suit a rope with a diameter of 11mm. He examined the stop descender with the manufacturers’ instruction manual. In fact, the Managers and Operators were not given a copy by the Contractors and Suppliers.
39        The belay rope supplied with the stop descender to the Managers and Operators was of 9mm diameter. Mr Scott opined that the combination might not be capable to function in controlling the descent of an adult person using the rescue kit.
40        Mr Scott was informed by Mr Gabriel Soh that the staff of the Operators and Managers were trained to use the stop descender with the tail end of the rope directed downwards. Mr Scott was of the view that this method of using the stop descender was incorrect because the tail end of the rope must be in the opposite direction to the load to increase the friction between the stop descender and the rope.
41        In August 2001 Mr Scott observed tests conducted with the same equipment and under simulated conditions. For comparative purposes, a separate stop descender set to maximum friction and a 11mm rope diameter rope was also tested. The tests were carried out at the same Team Challenge Pyramid at the Ubin Adventure Centre. The tests were completed over a period of 12 hours. The tests results were exhibited. Under trial condition “D”, where the condition of the 9mm rope was wet, all 20 tests except one presented ‘unacceptable slippage descent rate’. It meant that it was unsafe and almost certain injury would ensue. In contrast the results of Trial Condition “C”, where a WET rope of 11mm was used, all 9 tests showed that the descent had stopped with slight slip and it was safe. Only 1 test was ‘void’ because the lever of the stop descender was squeezed too long.
42        Mr Scott expressed the expert views that the incident occurred might have resulted from the factory setting of the pivot nut inside the stop descender. It was not set to maximum friction. Alternatively, the accident might have arisen because the belay rope of 9mm diameter was used in conjunction with the stop descender which was not set to maximum friction. He was of the opinion that the downward direction of the tail end rope, instead of being directed opposite the direction of the person being lowered, might also have contributed to the incident. In other words, he said that the tail end rope should have been directed through the karabiner and back down. Moreover, the wet condition of the rope as a result of the heavy rain might also have been a contributing factor.
43        When asked if the 9mm rope could be used safely, Mr Scott replied that it depended on the instructor’s skills in operating it. He emphasized that it ‘scared’ him to use a 9mm rope. He never used it. He stressed that the most important thing was to have the brake hand on the tail end rope. When suggested to him that Ben could have wrongly threaded the rope up after he had lowered Frederick, Mr Scott dismissed this suggestion, saying and demonstrating that it was well-nigh impossible to thread it back in the then prevailing circumstances.
The Suppliers’ & Contractors’ version
44        Though the Contractors and Suppliers put forward substantially similar versions of what had happened, the Contractors seek recourse against the Suppliers if and to the extent the stop descender and the prussic loop were found defective or if the training of the Operators’ instructors was found to be defective. Mr Richard Hope, a director of the Suppliers. He trained the staff of Ubin Resort Adventure Centre. At the time of training, he had 20 years experience in the outdoor adventure and training industry. His qualifications as a trainer were impressive.
45        In 1999 he was contacted by Mr Russell Moy and/or Mr Chew Ang Yew of the Contractors and asked to prepare a quotation for the supply of a ‘rescue kit’ to the resort and to train staff of the resort, who would later become instructors in the use of the equipment installed in the resort when conducting the resort’s training programs for its customers. The aim of the training programs was to provide all the resort instructors with the essential skills and information to conduct safe and successful programs in the areas of Challenge Rope Courses, Team Challenge Pyramid, Flying Fox and Abseiling. The quotations were submitted and the Managers issued the purchase orders in April and May 2000. Apart from the quotations and the purchase orders, there was no formal contractual arrangement between the Suppliers and the Contractors.
46        Mr Hope said that in putting together the rescue kit he had regard to the manufacturers’ information relating to the stop descender, the situations likely to be faced by persons using the adventure courses at the resort and the fact that the instructors would need to carry the rescue kits on their backs, which accordingly had to be as light as possible. The rescue kit comprised, among others, the backpack, pliers, knife, rescue pulley double sheave, rescuemate pulley, stop descender, 9mm rope cum mantel (33 m per rescue pack), 4 karabiners, prussic cord large, prussic cord small, tube tape 2 m length, figure 8 descender and 2 lobster claws. The stop descenders were purchased from SRTE Australia, Single Rope Technique Equipment.
47        The stop descender was supplied with a booklet from SRTE containing the manufacturers’ information and instructions about, inter alia, the stop descender. Mr Hope, however, did not supply the Managers a copy of the booklet. As a result the Operators did not have a copy and their employees, the instructors at the resort, did not have the opportunity to study them.
48        At page 24 of the booklet, it is stated that generally the rope according to the specifications should flow freely through the stop descender. However, it was noted that when conditions are at their worse, wet and muddy, descending may be extremely slow and difficult on stiff or larger diameter ropes. The manufacturers therefore suggested that the users’ repelling tactics should be modified accordingly. It was emphasized that the ‘HANDLE’ is the primary control mechanism-“squeezed to GO—let go to STOP. Then followed the important advice to “(h)old the Tail End of the Rope at all times not only for balance but as your secondary control mechanism.” The instructions went on to recommend the use of a Safely Belay at all times. 
49        Mr Hope referred to the booklet to confirm that the stop descender was suitable for use with ropes between 9mm and 12mm, provided that an adjustment is made to the stop descender to suit the rope used. He said he told the manufacturers about his intention to use the stop descender with a 9mm rope. The internal camming mechanism should be adjusted to a 9mm rope. In this case, Mr Scott found that the stop descender was not set to maximum. In response to this observation, Mr Hope referred to the comments of some staff (unidentified and not called as a witness) that at worst was that the load on the rope may creep and not free fall. The point is that as long as the size of the rope was between 9-12mm, the stop descender should not fail, regardless of the rope adjustment setting from maximum to minimum friction.
50        Mr Hope explained that he decided to include the prussic loop because he took a conservative view as to the safety of persons in belaying situations. But it was imperative to set the length of prussic loop having regard to the height of the person belaying and the position of the stop descender. He should have said in his affidavit evidence that it was important to ensure that the small prussic rope (the knot) wrapped round the larger rope (tail end of the static 9mm rope) did not come in contact with the stop descender. He also claimed that he always taught the person using the prussic loop that he must at all times keep a brake-hand upon the rope.
51        Against this, Ben and several instructors gave evidence that Mr Hope did not teach them about these at all. Mr Hope told them that the stop descender would stop the fall once the handle was released. Ben, Lee Tuck Hume, Omar Rosli, Jaime Chua and Denise Oi all gave the following evidence. They were taught that the double fisherman’s knot of the prussic loop was to be tied. The two ends of the prussic loop would stick out from the knot about 1 to 1 ½ inches. All instructors were required to prepare the prussic loop in the same way to get the same length. These witnesses also told me that there were no instructions to vary the prussic length according to each instructor’s height or for any other factor. They also said that in a rapid descent they were told to take their hands off the stop descender and the prussic loop. They were assured that the stop descender would work every time. Mr Hope had given the instructors training manuals. In none of the 6 manuals was it mentioned that the prussic length should be varied from person to person. On 17 December 2000 during the tests both Mr Russell Moy and Richard Delaney found that the instructors were still using  the prussic loop in the way they were taught. Mr Moy noted that “the prussic did not work because the lanyard was too long and therefore the prussic knot simply rested on the stop descender not allowing it to get tight and grip the rope.” Mr Delaney observed that “Ubin staff set the PL too long and this meant that it came in contact with the Stop Device. For a prussic knot to “grab” the rope, it should not be in contact with anything but the rope.”
52        Mr Richard Delaney, a consultant of the Suppliers, gave evidence. He said that the stop descender is functional and safe when used correctly in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions. As long as the diameter of the rope is within the manufacturer’s specifications, the stop descender is functional and safe. What the rope adjustment setting does is to change the friction setting for the SD lever, making it easier to squeeze with varying rope diameters. The functionality and safety of the Rescue Kit should be evaluated in its totality and not its component parts in isolation. He was of the view that the Rescue Kit as a whole was functional and safe.
53        Mr Richard Delaney referred to his preliminary views in his report of 18 April 2001. On hindsight he believed by the time he gave affidavit evidence in September 2002 ‘went beyond the basis for those views’. The reasons were these. First, the tests were not conducted in a scientific manner but rather to observe the resort staff demonstrating the lowering procedure. Secondly, only one test was conducted for each of the loads of 50 kg, 65 kg and 80 kg and the test methods might have been inconsistent. Lastly, he had not tested the stop descender with an 11mm rope.
54        He opined that the cause of Ivy’s fall was probably ‘operator’s error’. Ben had successfully lowered Frederick who was 86 kg. He surmised that Ben might have accidentally squeezed the lever fully, instead of in a controlled manner and before his brake-hand was in a ready position. When he saw Ivy falling he panicked and did not let go the lever of the stop descender and grab the tail end of the rope. He said: “With the prussic set too long, it also fails to arrest the descent”.  The prussic, if it abutted the stop descender, would also not stop the fall. He further postulated that after lowering Frederick, Ben retrieves the rope and threads the stop descender incorrectly. He then attempts to lower Ivy. If threaded incorrectly, the rope would run freely through the stop descender and provide minimum friction.
55        In my judgment there was no wrong threading of the rope. The lever of the stop descender, as shown in the demonstration, would remain stiff. The lever would not budge from the open position because of the force of the load on the rope. Secondly, the force required at the brake-hand to prevent descent would increase three-fold. Thirdly, if the rope was soaked, as indeed was the rope on the rainy day in question, the force on the brake-hand would be even greater. This was due to the fact that wet rope generates less friction. Fourthly, the descent of Ivy, if the rope was wrongly threaded, would have become a very slow process. Fifthly, if the rope had been wrongly threaded, it would have been discovered by Lee Tuck Hume. He was the first person to have checked the stop descender after the incident. Finally, I accept Ben’s evidence that he found, as was demonstrated in court, it was easier to squeeze the lever of the stop descender to retrieve the rope after lowering Frederick.
Findings of Court
56        Having regard to all the evidence seen and heard in court, I find that the cause of Ivy’s free-fall was not due to any error on the part of Ben. Ivy was suspended on her harness and the stop descender initially held her up. Ben then press the stop descender and released but Ivy then had a free fall. This was due to the stop descender being unable to stop the very wet 9mm rope from slipping through it, resulting in Ivy falling to the ground. I accept Mr Scott’s evidence that the 9mm rope with the factory setting was incompatible and this was aggravated by the fact that the rope was very wet by the time it was used to lower Ivy. In the case of Frederick, he was successfully lowered because Ben controlled the lever and the rope had just been taken out of the rescue kit, where it was kept dry, and in the short time it was threaded through the stop descender it could not have been too soaked with rain.  By the time the rope was used on Ivy it was too soaked in rain water. I had no reason to believe that Ben would not have controlled the lever of the stop descender in just the same manner as he had controlled it for the descent of Frederick.
57        Ivy would not have fallen if the prussic loop had been operated by Ben in the manner it should have been operated. Ben did not ensure that the length of the prussic loop was sufficient for it to be so taut that the knot could grab the tail end rope effectively stopping the descent of the rope. But Ben was not at fault. He was taught by Mr Hope to hold on to the knot so that the tail end rope could pay out as the loan descended and that if he let go his right brake hand the knot would go up to the stop descender thereby stopping the descent. The manufacturers instructed, and this was amply proven during the demonstrations to and by the court, that an operator of the lowering system must ‘hold the Tail End of the Rope at all times…as (your) secondary speed control mechanism’, only allowing the paying out of the rope gradually through the knot in the process of controlling the descent. In the event that the right brake hand is taken off the tail end rope, the prussic loop (of the right and  sufficient length) would have become taut and the knot would have tightened and ‘grabbed’ the tail end rope, thereby preventing the tail end rope from further slipping through the stop descender in its descent. In my view, it is very clear on the evidence that Mr Hope did not teach the instructors of the Operators adequately. In consequence, the secondary fail-safe system also failed. The Suppliers, as the suppliers of the stop descender and the training of the instructors through Mr Hope, must be entirely to blame for the incident. They unquestionably owed a duty of care to Ivy and to the Managers and Operators of the resort. The scope of the duty of care is concomitant with the implied terms, which I am setting out in the following paragraph.
58        Contractually, as between the Contractors and the Managers,  there was a implied term of their agreement that the Contractors were required to design and supply the stop descender and the prussic loop which were fit for the purposes of the Ubin Adventure Centre instructors. In my view, there was also an implied term that there shall be proper and adequate training and instructions on the operation of both the stop descender and the prussic loop. In my judgment, the Contractors had breached those implied terms of the agreement. The stop descender had a pivot bolt nut setting which was incompatible to function effectively with the 9mm rope supplied during wet weather usually encountered in Pulau Ubin. As regards the training, Mr Hope failed to instruct and to ensure that each instructor knew it was important to adjust the length of the prussic loop to achieve ‘grabbing’ of the tail end rope in a free fall as a secondary control mechanism.
59        Similarly, as between the Contractors and the Suppliers, those implied terms are applicable and there had been similar breaches of those terms.
Quantum of Damages
60        I now turn to the quantum of damages payable to Ivy. Parties have agreed on the sum of  $82,544.97 as special damages and  other items which I will set out later. There remains three heads of claims: (a) the compensation for pain and suffering and loss of amenities; (b) post-writ to pre-trial loss of earnings; and (c) future loss of earnings.
Ivy’s injuries & background
61        As stated earlier, Ivy suffered multiple rib fractures from the 4
th
 to 9
th
 ribs on her right chest and a fractured dislocation of the T8 vertebra and the burst fracture of the T12 vertebra resulting in paralysis from the waist down and the loss of bowel and bladder control.
62        In April 1994 Ivy graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a diploma in accounting. She chose that profession so that she could start working earlier to earn money to take care of her parents and contribute to the household expenses as soon as possible. She kept her sights to become a qualified accountant. She studied part time and achieved her goal of passing the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (“ACCA”) examinations within 5 years. It was a credible performance, seeing the very low passing rate for the ACCA examinations. Showing her drive, she left her first job after 5 years and joined a larger organisation to upgrade herself. She was confirmed in her new job within a year and was promoted with a 28% increase in salary. At the time of her most unfortunate and serious injuries, she was holding the post of Senior Accounts Executive with an annual remuneration of more than $40,000. She became a Certified Public Account just about a month before the incident when she was 26 years of age.
63        Ivy did not just work on “numbers”. In Trans-Link, she was leader of her Wits team. When she was with her first employers, Toys “R” Us, she set up the Novell Network System, the server network for all individual personal computers in the firm. In her 6 years of working, her base salary increased by more than 230%. In Ngee Ann Polytechnic, for a total of 24 subjects she obtained 7 As, 10Bs, 6 Cs and 1 D for the examination she took in Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
64        Mr Chan Ket Teck, a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers, gave evidence as an expert witness for Ivy’s claim for loss of earnings. Mr Chan’s credentials were not in issue. In his report, he set out 3 possible scenarios for the career progression and remuneration of an accountant with similar qualifications and experiences to those of Ivy, namely (a) Scenario (1) a competent performer, i.e. an accountant whose performance meets the minimum expectation of the job; (2) A praiseworthy performer, i.e. an accountant of above average performance; and (3) an outstanding performer, i.e. an accountant who is a high flyer with excellent performance. Mr Chan advisedly projected that it is highly probable that Ivy would have proven to be between a praiseworthy to an outstanding performer. In making the computations, Mr Chan had not taken into account any annual salary increment into account. For the entire 15 year period, the employer’s CPF contribution is based on the current rate of 16% of the employee’s salary, with a maximum contribution of $11,500 on ordinary wages per year.
65        Mr Chan recognized that Ivy’s prospective career path post the accident would depend on several factors, including the economic situation, the industry she would be employed in, the nature of the company she is working for and the most importantly her performance. For scenario 1, which would be the slowest career progression and minimum salary for an accountant whose performance meets the minimum expectation of the job. Such a person would have been engaged as a Senior Accountant at a base annual salary of $40,000 in January 2001. After a 4 year period, he would have been promoted to Accounting Manager at an annual salary of $55,000. After 5 years, he would be promoted to Finance Manager at an annual salary of $70,000. Mr Chan opined that over a period of 15 years, such a person would likely earn a total remuneration of $1,168,000 (amount is rounded).
66        In scenario 2, Mr Chan had in mind an accountant of above average performance, with initiative and the ability to work independently and be responsible for strategic planning, development and management of the business. Such a person would progress from being Senior accountant to Accounting Manager in 3 years and after 3 years he would be promoted to the post of the Finance Manager at the annual salary of $95,000. He would probably move to the post of Financial Controller after 4 years, at an annual salary of $130,000. The next corporate grade would be Chief Finance Officer at a salary of $165,000 which could be reached within the next 4 years. In this scenario, he would have earned a total remuneration of $2.3 million  (in round figures).
67        In scenario 3 is the case of an outstanding performer who is a high flyer with excellent performance. He is also innovative, highly motivated and would ultimately lead a team of finance and treasury professionals to support the Chief Executive Officer in steering the company to achieve its business plans in Singapore and the region. Such a person would be a Senior Accountant for 2 years, then Accounting Manager at the annual salary of $80,000, and after 2 years further promoted to Finance Manager at an annual salary of $110,000. He would then have moved on to Financial Controller after 3 years, at an annual salary of $160,000. The next corporate grade would be Chief Finance Officer at an annual salary of $200,00 which could be reached within 3 years. Within 4 years the high flyer could be promoted to the senior Chief Finance Officer, such as Regional Chief Finance Officer, at an annual salary of $250,000. Such a high flyer would have earned $3.35 million (in round figures) over 15 years from January 2001.
68        On the basis of Ivy’s track record of progression in her employment Mr Chan opined that Ivy is an above average performer. He said that Ivy “would earn a total remuneration between $2.3 million and $3.4 million (including bonuses, allowances and CPF contributions over the 15 years following her accident.
69        Mr Kaka Singh, who practice as an auditor but who has substantial experience about careers in the accountancy profession, gave evidence for the Managers, Operators, Contractors and Suppliers. He disagrees with Mr Chan and does not think that Ivy is such an above average person based on her ACCA pass rate. He is of the view that Ivy is an average/competent accountant. But both of them agreed on what an average/competent accountant could earn.
70        Parties opposing Mr Chan’s opinion contended that a number of factors militate against the 3 scenarios postulated by him. The very poor economic outlook was not sufficiently considered. Mr Chan relied on the report of Watson & Whyte regarding salary levels. Unlike the broad based report of the Ministry of Manpower, Watson & Whyte’s statistics included those from comparatively higher salaries paid by multi-nationals. There were also prospects of a need for fewer accountants in Singapore. Mr Kaka Singh is of the view that the basis of promotions every 3 to 4 years is too optimistic.
71        In cross examination, Mr Chan confirmed that in a cohort of say 300 accountants only 10% make it to Chief Financial Officer. He also confirmed that only 1% rise to the rank of partnership in his firm.
72        Counsel for the Suppliers noted that Ivy’s past earnings after 6 years of employment was in the range of $2,700 per month. This ranked about the bottom 25% quartile of the accountants as per MOM’s survey. That Ivy took 5 years to obtain her ACCA is commendable but it was pointed out that top accountant students obtain such qualifications within 2 ½ years. Mr Kaka Singh also referred to the fact that Ivy has no background experience of working in any large accounting firm. Without such experiences, Ivy’s chances of becoming a CFO or a Financial Director of a  large corporation are remote. Mr Kaka Singh also referred to the average performance of Ivy in her Diploma in Accounting and in her school and polytechnic life.
73        It was submitted by counsel for the Operators that all considered Ivy would probably rise to the ranks of a Manager at an annual salary of $80,000.
74        In my judgment Ivy will be a moderately above the average accountant. She is slightly better than the average accountant. Though she has drive, the opportunities may be harder to come by. Her prospects are constrained by her past working experience and limited exposure and by the accountancy world she will be facing in Singapore, with all the chances and changes of a globalised mature economy.
75        The case of 
Chan Heng Wah v Peh Thiam Choh
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 175
 illustrates a helpful approach when assessing the probable earning prospects of an average professional. The damages for ‘lost years’ of a 20 year old 2
nd
 year medical student were to be assessed. The court was invited to assess damages on the average of a Medical Officer’s salary and Superscale A salary in Government. The court declined because of the high degree of speculation that the plaintiff would attain Superscale D1 or Superscale S. The Court found that the plaintiff could rise to the level of a Registrar. The multiplicand was calculated at $66,494.34 taking into consideration the annual pay of a Registrar less tax liability and adding CPF benefits.
76        Reference was referred as a matter of interest (and not as a matter of reliance by counsel for the Operators) to the so-called ‘median approach’ of the courts. In 
Lai Chi Kay v Lee Kuo Shin
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 167
 the future lost earnings of a young 24 year old Hong Kong 4
th
 year medical student was assessed by the Court as the average between the maximum and minimum in the salary scale for government doctors in Hong Kong. The multiplier awarded was 15.
77        It was pointed out to the court that Ivy is mentally active and alert. She can do accounting related work from home if she is minded to. The possibilities for home-based work are growing, with internet and e-mail facilities. Alternatively, she is capable of giving tuition to students up to Junior College level. I agree. 
78        Taking all factors into consideration, and doing the best, I would assess her future earning prospect as $80,000 per annum. There must be deducted tax liability and added the employer’s CPF benefits.
79        I now come to assess the damages for pain and suffering. Ivy suffers from, as noted earlier, lower limb paralysis with loss of sexual function, bladder and bowel dysfunction. In 
Cheng Chay Choo v Wong Meng Teck
 [Oct 1992] K S Rajah JC awarded $120,000 for a similar below the waist paralysis. In 
Ng Song Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd
 [1997] [unreported] this court awarded $160,000 to a 29 year old man who had complete paralysis below waist and in addition he had partial paralysis of his upper limbs. I would award Ivy $130,000 for pain and suffering.
80        As for the multiplier, Ivy’s counsel submits it should be higher than 18, relying on 
Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck
  
[2003] 1 SLR 333
. In 
Ng Song Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd
 (supra) I provided 15 years as the multiplier. It seems to me that we have to be careful to hold the line or damages would escalate. The multiplier should be 15 years.
81        Ivy is seeking damages of an unspecified amount for future medical complications. There was also no agreement on Ivy’s pre-trial loss of earnings from November 2001 to date of trial, January 2003. Ivy is seeking more than $2,700 per month on the basis that she would have had a promotion or salary increase between Nov 2001 and Jan 2003. More evidence and submissions are required on these issues.
82        Subject to the issues reserved above, the damages payable to Ivy are as follows:
            (a) Pain and suffering                            $  130,000.00
            (b) Loss of Future Earnings       (parties to work out the figures)
            (c) Future Medical Expenses                 (to be assessed)
            (d) Future nursing care (lump sum)        $100,800.00 (agreed)
            (e) Wheel chair (lump sum)                   $  12,600.00 (agreed)
            (f) Mattress (lump sum)                         $    3,770.00 (agreed)
            (g) Commode etc (lump sum)                $    6,060.00 (agreed)
            (h) Special damages                              $   82,544.97 (agreed)
            (i) Pre-trial earnings & CPF                           (to be assessed)
83        There will be judgment accordingly. Parties are to work out the arithmetic and settle the draft orders, including the appropriate orders as to costs. Parties are directed to attend a hearing before me to finalise the outstanding matters.

1          The appellant (“Pritam”) claimed trial to the following charge:
 
You, Pritam Singh s/o Gurmukh Singh, NRIC No. S1490475A, are charged that you, between the period of May 2001 and 14 March 2002, at ‘Cairnhill Towers’, located at No. 81 Cairnhill Road, Singapore, did abet by intentionally aiding one Sukdev Singh s/o Harjit Singh the (sic) commission of the offence of employing one Sundram Ramajeyem, FIN No. G9013865R, a Sri Lankan National, as a security guard, whom you had reasonable grounds for believing to be a person who has acted in contravention of Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 133, and punishable under Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 133, read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 2          He was convicted by the district judge in the court below and sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence.
Background facts
3          In February 2001, Sundram Ramajeyem (“Sundram”) entered Singapore illegally from Sri Lanka. With the help of an agent, he found work with Top Guard Security Agency (“TGSA”) as a security guard at Cairnhill Towers.  Sundram’s agent, who could not be located, gave him a pink Singapore identity card which bore the name “Rakang Subramaniam” (“the identity card”). While Sundram was working at Cairnhill Towers, he went by the name “Ashok Karan”.
4          On 14 March 2002, Sundram was arrested by immigration officers during an inspection of Cairnhill Towers. He was convicted on 11 April 2002 under s 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) for entering Singapore without a valid pass. In his statements to the police, Sundram claimed that it was Pritam who paid him his salary while he was working at Cairnhill Towers. He also stated that he had told Pritam that he was in possession of a Singapore identity card, and had informed Pritam that the card was not his.
5          Pritam was an employee of TGSA. The exact scope of his duties was disputed below, as the prosecution claimed that he was an operations manager while the defence maintained that he was merely a patrolling officer. However, it was not disputed that he would regularly visit and perform checks at the locations where TGSA provided security guards, which included Cairnhill Towers.
6          Sukdev Singh was the sole proprietor of TGSA (“Sukdev”). He was subsequently charged with having employed an illegal immigrant, while Pritam was charged with having abetted Sukdev in the unlawful employment. The charge against Sukdev was withdrawn after he pleaded guilty to a different charge.
The trial below
7          The prosecution’s case was that Pritam knew or had reason to believe that Sundram was an immigration offender, but had allowed him to continue working at Cairnhill Towers. He had therefore abetted the unlawful employment. Sundram was the main prosecution witness. In his testimony below, he reiterated that he had told Pritam of his possession of the identity card, and had informed Pritam that the card did not belong to him.
8          The defence claimed that Pritam was a patrolling officer, and could not have abetted Sundram’s employment because he was not part of the management of TGSA. Pritam claimed that he had no reason to suspect that Sundram was an immigration offender. The defence argued that Sundram had started working at Cairnhill Towers in May 2000, and therefore it was TGSA’s operations manager at that time, one Charan Singh (“Charan”), who had abetted his unlawful employment.
9          The trial judge dismissed the idea that only Charan was responsible for abetting the unlawful employment. Charan had left TGSA on 28 February 2001. The period specified in the charge was from May 2001 to March 2002, several months after his departure. As such, the judge held that Charan’s role as the previous operations manager was irrelevant.
10        The judge accepted that Sundram had shown the identity card to Pritam, and had informed him that it belonged to someone else. She found that Pritam had taken over as the operations manager after Charan’s departure, and was a key person in the company’s management. The judge held that Pritam had chosen to be wilfully blind to Sundram’s status as an illegal immigrant, as there were patently suspicious circumstances surrounding his employment. Nevertheless, he allowed Sundram to continue working at Cairnhill Towers.
11        The judge found Pritam guilty of the charge and sentenced him to 18 months’ imprisonment. During the mitigation hearing, his counsel stated that Pritam’s only mistake was “not to take steps to bring to notice of the employer when he was shown the identity card and his failure to follow-up”. In her grounds of decision, the judge stated that this sentence confirmed her finding that Pritam was shown the identity card.
The criminal motion
12        Pritam appealed against the decision below. He also filed a criminal motion to adduce further evidence on appeal. This motion was filed in order to support two claims: that Charan – who appeared as a witness for the prosecution – had given false evidence during the trial, and that the defence counsel below had acted against his instructions when he told the court during mitigation that Pritam had been shown the identity card.
13        The reception of fresh evidence during an appeal is governed by s 257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which reads:
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate’s Court.
14        The reception of evidence under s 257(1) is subject to the three conditions found in 
Ladd v Marshall
 [1954] 3 All ER 745: non-availability, credibility and relevance. After reviewing the evidence, I found that it did not satisfy the criteria as it was not relevant to this appeal. I accordingly dismissed the motion.
15        Pritam sought to adduce seven affidavits before this Court. The first five affidavits related to Charan’s allegedly false testimony below. These affidavits comprised the transcript of a conversation which took place on 2 May 2003.
16        Charan testified during the trial that he did not know Sundram, or anyone named “Rakang Subramaniam” or “Ashok Karan”. Several months after the trial, Pritam confronted Charan and demanded to know why he had lied in court. During that conversation, Charan admitted that he did actually know who Sundram was. What Charan did not know was that Pritam was carrying a tape recorder at that time, and was surreptitiously recording their conversation with the intention of adducing the transcript as evidence during this appeal.
17        If Charan gave false evidence during the trial below, he was liable for perjury under s 191 and 193 of the Penal Code. That was a matter for investigation by the appropriate authorities. However, I found that the evidence obtained via Pritam’s amateur ‘sting’ operation was irrelevant to this appeal because the judge had never relied on Charan’s evidence in the first place. This was very clear from her grounds of decision in which she stated:
I do not intend to examine the role of Charan Singh in TGS. My views are that regardless of the role played by Charan during his employment in TGS, he did not feature in TGS after he left on 28 February 2001.
18        The last two affidavits related to the mitigation plea presented by Pritam’s counsel below. Both affidavits emphasised that Pritam was shocked by his counsel’s admission that he had been shown the identity card, as such a submission was contrary to his explicit instructions.
19        If Pritam’s counsel acted against his instructions below, he may have failed to provide adequate professional services. This could eventually result in disciplinary proceedings under s 75B and the Second Schedule to the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161). However, the evidence relating to counsel’s lapse of judgment was otherwise irrelevant to this appeal. The mitigation plea was made only after the judge had found Pritam guilty, and was therefore irrelevant to his appeal against conviction. There was nothing to suggest that the impugned admission had any impact on the sentence imposed, and was thus also irrelevant to his appeal against sentence.
20        During the appeal, Pritam’s counsel relied on 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
 to argue that fresh evidence may be adduced even if it fails the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test, as long as justice so requires. That was undeniably true. However, the case of 
Chia Kah Boon
 was very different from the present appeal. In 
Chia Kah Boon
, the evidence did not meet the requirements of 
Ladd v Marshall
 because it was obtainable during the trial below. By contrast, the evidence in the present appeal was simply irrelevant.
21        The court in 
Chia Kah Boon
 emphasised that the exception to 
Ladd v Marshall
 was a narrow one which was warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances: see 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
. There were no circumstances here which justified a departure from the rule in 
Ladd v Marshall
. Furthermore, it is settled law that irrelevant evidence may not be adduced: s 5 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
The appeal
22        Pritam appealed on three grounds: first, that the judge erred in accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and in disbelieving the defence witnesses; second, that the judge erred in calling for the defence at the close of the prosecution’s case; third, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal on all three grounds.
The judge did not err in accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses
23        After hearing the evidence of all the witnesses, the judge found that the prosecution witnesses were truthful and that their evidence was credible. By contrast, her observation of the defence witnesses led her to the following conclusion:
I find that the defence witnesses had rehearsed their evidence such that their evidence-in-chief synchronized. But, upon further questioning, their answers diverged, revealing marked inconsistencies. They were also vague and lacked logic. It was obvious that they were playing down the role of the Accused in TGS.
24        An examination of the record of proceedings revealed no reason to disturb the judge’s conclusion. This ground of appeal was without merit.
The judge erred in finding that Pritam had been showed the identity card
25        In her grounds of decision, the judge stated that Sundram had maintained throughout the trial that he had shown the identity card to Pritam, and that the latter had told him to keep it. She thus accepted that Sundram had shown the identity card to Pritam. To bolster her finding, the judge relied on the statements made by Pritam's counsel during mitigation. On appeal, Pritam argued that the judge had erred in making this finding of fact.
26        It is true that a lower court’s findings of fact should not be lightly disturbed: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
. However, I found that the evidence in this case did not entitle the judge to conclude that Pritam had been shown the identity card. Throughout the proceedings below, Pritam had adamantly stated that he was not shown the identity card. More importantly, Sundram himself did not maintain that he had shown the identity card to Pritam. His only reference to having done so was in the following exchange during cross-examination:
Q:         Refer to P3 – Q & A 18 – did Pritam Singh say those last words in Q18 answer – “there won’t be any problem”?
A:         He did say those words.
…
Q:         This statement was made on 14 March 2002, when were these five words uttered to you by Pritam Singh?
A:         
When I showed the identity card to him
. I can’t remember the date. [emphasis added]
27        There was no other mention of Sundram having shown Pritam the identity card. A perusal of the evidence revealed that Sundram had consistently maintained that he had told Pritam about the identity card. Except for the passage reproduced above, he never claimed to have physically displayed the identity card to Pritam.
28        Under these circumstances, the judge was not entitled to find that Pritam had been shown the identity card. Moreover, she should not have relied on statements made during mitigation to confirm facts which were disputed during the trial. An appellate court is entitled to overturn a trial judge’s finding of fact if its assessment of the facts is not based on the demeanour of the witnesses, but on inferences drawn from the evidence as a whole: 
PP v Choo Thiam Hock & others
 
[1994] 3 SLR 248
. I allowed the appeal on this point, and found that Sundram had merely told Pritam that he was in possession of the identity card.
The fact that Sundram had verbally informed Pritam of the identity card did not make the conviction unsound
29        The law on abetting the employment of an illegal immigrant by intentional aiding was settled in 
Loh Kim Lan
 
& another v PP
 
[2001] 1 SLR 552
. In that case, the court held that the required 
mens rea
 was a dominant intention to assist the employer in committing the offence of employing illegal workers, with knowledge of the circumstances constituting that offence.
30        In the present appeal, Pritam did not dispute that the 
actus reus
 of the offence was made out. Instead, he argued that the judge’s error made his conviction unsound as he did not have the requisite 
mens rea
. He claimed that there was a “vast difference” between Sundram having shown him the identity card, and Sundram having told him that the card belonged to someone else. This was because the judge stated in her grounds of decision that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status because the photograph on the identity card bore no resemblance to Sundram himself.
31        I did not accept this argument. There were in fact several factors which the judge took into account when she found that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status. None of these factors were affected by her erroneous finding of fact. For example, the judge noted that, when Pritam handled Sundram’s salary vouchers, he must have realised that the vouchers showed no deductions for Central Provident Fund contributions or for the foreign workers’ levy. That meant that Sundram was neither a Singapore citizen nor a work permit holder. The judge also found that Pritam knew of TGSA’s application to the Licensing Division of the Police Force seeking approval for Sundram to be employed as a security guard in June 2001, and he knew that the application had been rejected. Furthermore, Sundram spoke with a fairly obvious accent, and had expressly told Pritam that he was in possession of another person’s identity card.
32        These were all patently suspicious circumstances which the judge relied on when she held that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status. These circumstances were independent of the allegation that Sundram had shown the identity card to Pritam. Therefore, even taking the judge’s erroneous finding of fact into account, I found no reason to disturb her conclusion that Pritam did have the requisite 
mens rea
 for the offence.
33        During oral submissions, Pritam’s counsel argued that the requisite 
mens rea
 was a dominant intention to assist the employer, and did not focus on the issue of knowledge. This argument was misconceived. The case law clearly shows that the requisite 
mens rea
 is whether the accused had knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence. The question of ‘dominant intention’ only arises where there is a dispute over whom the accused had actually abetted. This was seen in 
Daw Aye Aye Mu v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 64
, where the High Court held that whether the accused had aided the employer or the illegal immigrant would depend on his dominant intention at the time that he did the act which led to the illegal immigrant’s employment.
The judge did not err in calling for the defence
34        Pritam argued that the judge should not have called for his defence. His main contention was that Sundram was not a credible witness, and that his evidence could not be believed because it was often inconsistent. As Sundram was the main prosecution witness, the unreliable nature of his evidence meant that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden at the close of its case. In support of this argument, Pritam outlined in great detail the discrepancies in Sundram’s evidence.
35        I agreed that Sundram gave inconsistent evidence on the following matters:
a          The date on which he was given the identity card;
b          The date on which he started work at Cairnhill Towers;
c           The date on which he told Pritam that he was holding on to another person’s identity card;
d           Whether he had any previous jobs before working at Cairnhill Towers;
e          Why he went by the fictitious name of “Ashok Karan”;
f            Whether he had signed all the payment vouchers which were made out to him; and
g          Whether he had entered Singapore with a valid passport or visa.
36        However, I found no merit to the allegation that Sundram was an unreliable witness merely because his evidence was not perfect. His discrepancies related to minor details which were not crucial to this appeal. It was unequivocally stated in 
PP v Annamalai Pillai Jayanthi
 
[1998] 2 SLR 165
 that: 
Nevertheless, 
the mere presence of several discrepancies in the prosecution`s case cannot, per se, render its case manifestly unreliable
. It is incumbent upon the trial judge to consider whether the inconsistencies are sufficiently fundamental to nullify that part of the evidence which supports the charge. [emphasis added]
37        I found no reason to disturb the judge’s decision to call for the defence. In her grounds of decision, she concluded that Sundram was a truthful witness after she had observed his demeanour in court. Due weight should be accorded to a trial judge’s assessment of a witness’ credibility based on demeanour in court: 
Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 205
.
38        Despite the inconsistencies in his evidence, Sundram had never wavered on three points: he had told Pritam that he was in possession of a Singapore identity card; he had informed Pritam that the card did not belong to him; and it was Pritam who paid him his salary. If unrebutted, these three points would establish each essential element of the offence. As I agreed with the judge that Sundram was a credible witness, I could not fault her decision to call on Pritam for his defence, as required by the principles outlined in 
Haw Tua Tau & another v PP
 [1980–81] SLR 73.
Pritam remained liable for abetment even though Sukdev was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal
39        In his submissions, Pritam called it “remarkable” that he was charged for abetting Sukdev in employing Sundram, even though Sukdev was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. There was no merit to this assertion. There is no need for the principal to have been convicted prior to the abettor in order that the latter may be found liable for aiding him: 
Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP
 
[1993] 2 SLR 73
. After all, the verdicts against an abettor and his principal are not interdependent – the conviction of either party turns on the evidence against him, which may be different from that admitted against the other party: see 
Govindarajulu and another v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 838
.
The sentence was not manifestly excessive
40        There was no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by the judge. The benchmark sentence for cases which go to trial under s 57 of the Immigration Act has been set at 12 months: 
Soh Lip Hwa v PP
 
[2001] 4 SLR 198
. The sentence for abetting an offence is the same as if the abettor was charged for the offence itself: s 109 of the Penal Code.
41        Pritam had a previous conviction under s 57 of the Immigration Act, for which he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. As a repeat offender, it could not be said that his sentence of 18 months (a mere six months above the benchmark) was manifestly excessive.

            The appellant was convicted in the district court of an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon the expiry of the sentence he is presently serving.  He appealed against both his conviction and sentence.  I dismissed both appeals, and enhanced the sentence to 36 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon the expiry of the sentence he is presently serving.  I now give my reasons.
 
Preliminary issue
2      The appellant was charged as follows:
You, … are charged that … on the 27
th
 day of September 2000 at Block 2 Geylang Serai, #01-32, Singapore, being employed as a general manager of Seven Entertainment & Café Pte Ltd, and in such capacity entrusted with certain property, to wit, cash of $7,000, committed criminal breach of trust with respect to the said property by dishonestly converting it to your own use, and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code.
3          The appellant was originally charged under s 409 of the Penal Code, which involves the offence of criminal breach of trust by an agent.  However, the trial judge found on the evidence that the appellant was not an agent of Seven Entertainment & Café Pte Ltd (“Seven Entertainment”), but merely an employee.  She amended the charge accordingly, and the respondent did not take issue with this finding and the amendment.
Background facts
4          In May 2000, the appellant, who was running a coffee stall at Mohamed Sultan Road, decided to take over an existing pub at 16 Mohamed Sultan Road.  The new club was to be called ‘Club 7’, and the company Seven Entertainment was incorporated on 13 June 2000.  As he had little in the way of financial resources, the appellant approached his brother, Elangovan, as well as Goh Boon Leong  (“Goh”) and Ng Kim Wah (“Ng”) to become shareholders.  Goh and Ng were approached in August 2000, and both agreed to invest.  Goh was to hold 20% of the shares in Seven Entertainment, while Ng and Elangovan would hold 40% each.
5          Club 7 opened for business on 7 September 2000.  As Seven Entertainment held a public house first class liquor licence, it had to pay a 1% cess tax on the monthly sales of food and beverages.  Therefore, on 26 September 2000, the appellant went to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) to apply for cess registration.  IRAS issued the approval letter on the same day, subject to the payment of a $7,000 security deposit made payable to the Singapore Tourism Board. 
Prosecution’s case
6          It was the prosecution’s case that when Ng was informed of the need to pay the security deposit on 27 September 2000, he instructed his cashier Chew Kooi Choon Christine (“Christine”), to pass $7,000 cash to the appellant atNg’s goldsmith shop Kedai Emas Kampung Melayu (“Kedai Emas”) at Block 2 Geylang Serai #01-32 on the same day.  He also asked Loh Poh Chwee Dick (“Dick”), who was in charge of the renovations of Club 7, and with whom he had previous business dealings, to drive the appellant from Club 7 to Kedai Emas, and then to IRAS to make the payment.  However, the appellant did not use the cash to pay the security deposit.  Instead, he converted the money to his own use, paying $4,758.01 to Hong Leong Finance Limited to settle the arrears on his car (which was in his brother’s name, but of which he had primary use) which had been repossessed, and keeping the rest.  When questioned by Dick, Christine and Ng, the appellant lied and said that the security deposit had been paid, but that there was no receipt because IRAS would send one by post later.
 
7          His actions were only discovered on 4 December 2000, when Christine spoke with Chew Woon Leong Stanley (“Stanley”), a tax officer with IRAS, and found out that the security deposit was still unpaid.  She then informed Dick and Ng, and the latter reprimanded the appellant.  The next day, Ng went down to IRAS with another of Club 7’s employees, Manimaram S/O Devan, to meet Stanley and make the payment.  The appellant went to IRAS on the same day, where Stanley testified that the appellant first tried to pay the deposit, and then later claimed to have handed it to an Indian IRAS officer on 27 September 2000. Ng decided not to report the incident to the police after the appellant asked him for a second chance, explaining that he was in great financial difficulty and needed the money.  However, Goh became aware of the incident sometime in March or April 2002, after he took over as managing director of Seven Entertainment.  Goh called the appellant and asked him to return the money.  On 20 June 2002, as the appellant had still failed to pay up, Goh made a police report.  The appellant was subsequently charged.
 
The defence
8          The appellant did not dispute that he received the $7,000 on 27 September 2000, nor that he did not use it to pay the security deposit.  However, he claimed that the money was actually a personal loan from Ng.  He alleged that Ng was an illegal moneylender who had previously extended two loans of $20,000 to him, and that he had informed Ng on 27 September 2000 that he urgently needed another $5,000 loan to pay off the arrears on his brother’s car.  Ng had then agreed to make available to him $12,000, of which $7,000 was to be used to pay the security deposit.  However, when he arrived at Kedai Emas, he was informed by another cashier, Geng Poh Lian, that only $7,000 was available.  As he was not able to contact Ng, he and Dick proceeded to IRAS where he was prepared to use the $7,000 to make payment.  However, before he did so, he managed to contact Ng, who agreed to allow him to treat the $7,000 as a personal loan instead.
9          On 8 April 2002, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) raided Club 7 and Club 3, another club with which Ng, Goh, Dick, Christine and the appellant were involved.  The raid uncovered an offence of forgery of a public entertainment licence relating to the alteration of the occupancy load of Club 3, which the appellant initially admitted to.  However, a month later, the appellant changed his story, alleging that Ng was the mastermind behind the forgery and that he was going to inform the CPIB of this, and of Ng’s other illegal activities.  The appellant claimed that the police report was part of a conspiracy by Ng, Goh, Dick and Christine to damage his credibility.
Decision of the court below
10 The district judge highlighted the following ingredients of the offence under s 408:
(a) the accused must be an employee;
(b) he must have been entrusted, in such capacity, with property; and
(c) he must have committed breach of trust in respect of such property.
The element in dispute here is (iii).  While the prosecution argued that the $7,000 was entrusted to the appellant to pay for the security deposit, the appellant claimed that Ng later agreed to allow him to treat the $7,000 as a personal loan.
11        The district judge considered the evidence carefully and found the prosecution’s case to be “compelling”, placing particular importance on Stanley’s evidence.  She accepted the appellant’s argument that the other prosecution witnesses were possibly interested parties with a motive to lie, given their involvement with Club 3 and the appellant’s threats to expose Ng’s illegal activities to the CPIB.  Therefore, she rightly treated their evidence with “extreme caution”, given the “real risk of collusion”.  However, Stanley was an independent witness whose evidence was extremely convincing, especially since he had written out a note of the events of 5 December 2000 the very next day, when everything was still fresh in his mind.  His account of Christine’s and Ng’s surprise at discovering that the deposit was unpaid, and the appellant’s actions at IRAS on 5 December 2000, supported the prosecution’s case that the appellant had dishonestly converted the money for his own use, and later tried to cover it up.
12        Having convicted him under s 408, the district judge went on to sentence him to 20 months’ imprisonment.  Although she noted that the normal sentence for a first offender in cases involving such a small amount would be eight to nine months’ imprisonment, she increased it to 20 months’ imprisonment after taking into account his antecedents, his lack of remorse, the lack of any real mitigating factors and the “scheming manner” in which the appellant committed the offence.
The appeal
Appeal against conviction
13        The main thrust of the appellant’s appeal was that the learned district judge had erred in preferring the prosecution’s version of events over his own.
14        It is trite law that an appellate court, which does not have the advantage of hearing the witnesses and observing their demeanour, will not disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence.  In 
Tuen Huan Rui Mary v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 157
, I repeated the observations I had made earlier in 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 at p 710:
It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the district judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses.  An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the district judge’s decision, must not merely entertain doubts about whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong.
 
15        The appellant highlighted three main weaknesses in the prosecution’s case:
(a) the lapse of 22 months between the incident and the police report;
(b) Stanley’s lack of credibility as a witness; and
(c) certain inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses.
I shall now deal with each of these arguments in turn.
Lapse of 22 months
16        The district judge accepted that the lapse of 22 months was excessive.  She rejected the prosecution witnesses’ evidence that the delay was due to the fact that Goh only came to know about the events in March or April 2002.  Goh had become a director of Seven Entertainment on 15 March 2001, and another Club 7 employee Irwan bin Ismail and Ng himself had both testified that Goh was always actively involved in the running of Club 7.  Therefore, there was no reason for him to recheck the accounts for the year of 2000 in January 2002.  Given the circumstances, I found that the district judge was justified in finding that the police report was lodged at the instigation of Ng, as a direct response to the appellant’s threats to expose Ng to the CPIB.  While this meant that the testimonies of those involved in the CPIB case should be treated with caution, it did not mean that their evidence had no probative force at all.  In any case, the prosecution’s case was supported by the evidence of Stanley, who was a credible and independent witness.
Stanley's lack of credibility
17        The appellant’s attempts to undermine the credibility of Stanley consisted of nothing more than bare allegations.  The appellant alleged that Stanley had attended several Club 7 functions as Ng’s guest.  However, he could not provide any evidence of such alleged connections between Stanley and Ng, and also admitted that he had no personal knowledge that Ng and Stanley had unofficial dealings.  Before me, the appellant also alleged that Stanley may have been bribed by Ng.  However, this new allegation was again completely unsubstantiated.  Given the complete lack of basis for the appellant’s wild allegations against Stanley, I found that the district judge was justified in finding Stanley to be a credible witness.          
Inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses
18        Also, while there were minor inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, these were not fatal to the prosecution’s case.  Bearing in mind that almost two years have passed since the events occurred, it is understandable that the parties involved may not remember every single detail perfectly: 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
[1993] 3 SLR 261
; 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
; and 
Hon Chi Wan Colman v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 558
.
   Moreover, the points of divergence were irrelevant to the material elements of the charge, which was that the appellant had dishonestly converted the $7,000 which he was given to pay the security deposit for Seven Entertainment’s cess application.  It was beside the point that Christine could not remember how and when she first received the letter from IRAS that stated that the security deposit was payable.  The appellant placed great emphasis on how Christine and Ng found out about the non-payment of the deposit, when this was really of no consequence to the prosecution’s case.  Whether Stanley called Christine or Christine called Stanley certainly did not give credence to his allegations of a conspiracy to frame him.
19        The appellant submitted that the district judge had “erred in law” by giving the prosecution witnesses the benefit of the doubt when the burden of proof was clearly on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  This argument is clearly without merit.  The district judge was aware at all times of the burden and standard of proof required for a finding of guilt on a criminal charge.  The existence of minor inconsistencies in the evidence of some of the prosecution’s witnesses did not inexorably lead to the creation of reasonable doubt. The district judge was also perfectly entitled to disregard the discrepancies pointed out by the appellant for they were minor inconsistencies that did not detract from the value of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses: 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
; 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
; and 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
.  In any case, the court is entitled, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other: 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
; 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
; and 
Hon Chi Wan Colman v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 558
.
20        After carefully reviewing the Record of Proceedings, I found that the district judge’s findings of fact were amply supported by the evidence.  The version of events presented by the prosecution’s witnesses was cogent and consistent in the material aspects of the prosecution’s case.  Stanley’s testimony of the appellant’s suspicious behaviour at IRAS on 5 December 2000 was especially important, given that he was an independent witness with no motive to embellish his evidence.
21        In contrast, I found the appellant’s evidence completely unpersuasive.  His insistence that Ng was an illegal moneylender did not aid him in proving that the $7,000 in this case was a loan. His story that Ng had agreed to loan him $5,000, then later refused to accept the excess $2,000 which the appellant claimed he offered to return, was simply implausible.  At the end of the day, all the appellant could do was make completely baseless allegations against all the prosecution witnesses in a vain attempt to support his conspiracy theory.  Besides his attempts to attack Stanley’s credibility, he also claimed that the charge was originally framed under s 409 because Ng had connections with the police and had consulted a police officer in order to “secure the highest charge”.  This was, like most of his other allegations, not supported by a shred of evidence.
22        The appellant’s vague and contradictory evidence in the district court surrounding the repayment of the alleged loan only served to further undermine his version of events.  He initially claimed to have repaid the sum between December 2000 and January 2001, then later changed his mind and said he was unable to say exactly when he had repaid the loan.  His claim that he did not know how much he had paid Ng in total, and that he had only paid whatever Ng had asked for, was simply incredible.  The appellant was obviously astute, and given that he was “financially weak”, would surely not have been so careless with any money he had.
23        Therefore, I found that the appellant was rightly convicted.     
Appeal against sentence
24        For a s 408 offence, the maximum term of imprisonment is seven years.  The district judge considered the case of 
Sim Yeow Seng v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 44
, where the accused, who had an antecedent for criminal breach of trust with another charge of cheating taken into consideration, pleaded guilty to a s 408 charge involving $7,777.27 and was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.  After taking into account the appellant’s more serious antecedents, his lack of remorse, the absence of any real mitigating factors and the manner in which he committed the offence, she sentenced him to 20 months’ imprisonment.
25        I could not agree with this aspect of the trial judge’s decision.  It is true that in cases involving criminal breach of trust, the value of the property misappropriated is a relevant consideration: 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
.  However, the court’s sentencing discretion is never restricted by the amount involved: 
Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 617
.  While past cases are no doubt helpful guidelines, care must be taken to avoid sacrificing justice at the altar of blind consistency.  Each case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances: 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
.
26        I noted that this particular case is striking for its lack of any mitigating circumstances whatsoever.  The appellant does not have the benefit of a guilty plea.  He has shown no remorse nor made any restitution.  His claim that he is the sole breadwinner who needs to take care of his ill and aged parents cannot hold much weight, for it is settled law that any hardship caused to the offender’s family as a result of the imprisonment of the offender has little mitigating value save in very exceptional or extreme circumstances:  
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
.  This is an unavoidable consequence occasioned by the offender’s own criminal conduct and should not affect what would otherwise be the proper sentence: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
; 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
; 
PP v Yap Koon Mong
 
[1999] 4 SLR 257
.  The appellant has failed to point to any exceptional circumstances in this case to warrant a departure from this established principle.
27        In contrast, the list of aggravating factors here clearly justifies the imposition of a long deterrent sentence.  The appellant has a long list of antecedents, most of which involve dishonesty.  In March 1995, he was convicted of three charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, with six similar charges taken into consideration.  In December 1995, he was convicted of giving false information under s 26(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).  In May 2003, he was convicted of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code (although he is appealing against this conviction).  He also had other prior convictions for careless driving and for providing public entertainment without a licence.
28        Besides his poor record, the circumstances of the present charge also show the appellant to be a shrewd and scheming rogue.  He attempted to cover up the misappropriation of the money with a series of lies and deceptions.  Even when discovered, he continued to concoct ever more elaborate stories designed to cover his tracks and cast the blame on others.  Not only has he shown no remorse for his actions, he has also continued to make baseless allegations against all the prosecution witnesses, most notably against Stanley, who clearly has no personal interest in the case.
29        Taking into account all the aggravating factors, and the appellant’s long list of antecedents, I was of the view that the sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment was not only not manifestly excessive, but was instead manifestly inadequate. 
Conclusion
30        For the reasons above, I dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence, and enhanced the appellant’s sentence to 36 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon the expiry of the present sentence he is serving.
Appeals against conviction and sentence dismissed; sentence enhanced to 36 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon expiry of the present sentence the appellant is serving.",2003-08-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

  – 
Sentencing
  – 
Several accused charged with rape, abetment, procurement and living on the earnings of prostitution
  – 
Proper sentence to be imposed in such circumstances.
 
 
1.         This is a case of a 13 year-old girl brought into Singapore to work as a prostitute.
 
2.         The girl, who shall be identified by her nickname T, is born on 1 October 1989.
3.         Five persons were charged in connection with her prostitution activities.  They are Kalathithara Subran Hilan (“Hilan”), Thankappan Ayyappan (“Vijay”), Yong Ah Lai, Marni A/P Konasagaran (“Marni” or “Bavani”) and Chidamparam Palanivelu (“Velu”).
4.         Hilan was charged with two counts of rape of T on 10 May and between 10 and 23 May 2002.
5.         Vijay, Yong Ah Lai and Marni were charged with (i) abetting Hilan to rape T on 10 May 2002, (ii) bringing T into Singapore by false pretences for the purpose of prostitution, and (iii) living on the earnings of the prostitution of T.
6.         Vijay, Yong Ah Lai, Marni and Velu were charged with abetting Hilan to rape T between 10 and 23 May 2002.
7.         At the beginning of the trial, Hilan, Vijay, Yong Ah Lai and Marni indicated that they wanted to plead guilty.  Their cases were transferred to another court to be dealt with.
8.         Vijay and Marni pleaded guilty and were convicted and sentenced on three offences
(i)         for procuring T for the purpose of prostitution, an offence under s 140(1)(b) of the Women’s Charter, for which they were sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined $5000 or six months imprisonment in default of payment,
(ii)        for living on the earnings of the prostitution of T, an offence under s 146(1) of the Women’s Charter, for which they were given similar sentences to that of under s 140(1)(b), and
(iii)       for abetting Hilan to rape T, an offence under s 376(1) of the Penal Code for which they were both sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with an additional six strokes of the cane for Vijay.
The custodial sentences for offences (i) and (ii) were concurrent and consecutive to that for offence (iii).
9.         Hilan and Yong Ah Lai were sent back to be tried together with Velu before me.
10.       Before me Hilan faced two charges of raping T, Yong Ah Lai faced two charges of abetting Hilan to rape T and one charge of procuring T for the purpose of prostitution, one charge of bringing T into Singapore for the purpose of prostitution and one charge of living on the earnings of the prostitution of T.  Velu faced one of abetting Hilan to rape T.
11.       At the end of the trial I convicted the three of them on all the charges they faced except the charge against Yong Ah Lai for bringing T into Singapore.  Hilan and Yong Ah Lai have not appealed against the convictions and sentences, but Velu has appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed on him.
12.       Against this backdrop, these grounds will deal only with Velu’s case.  The evidence adduced at the trial which relate to the charge he faced will be referred to.
13.       The charge that Velu faced with Yong Ah Lai was that they together with Vijay and Marni
sometime between 10 May 2002 and 23 May 2002, in Singapore, did engage with one another in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to procure men to rape one [T], and pursuant to that conspiracy sometime between 10 May 2002 and 23 May 2002 at Room 7, No. 3 Lorong 18 Geylang, Singapore, one Kalathithara Subran Hilan, male/36 years old, raped the said [T] and [they have] thereby abetted the said offence of rape which act was committed in consequence of [their] abetment, and [they have] thereby committed an offence punishable under section 376(1) read with section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
14.       The offence referred to is rape as defined in s 375(e), that a man commits rape against a woman if he has sexual intercourse with her, with or without her consent, when she is under 14 years of age.
The background facts
15.       T stayed with her parents in Muar.  Marni was their neighbour.  Marni and Vijay approached T’s mother and proposed that T come to Singapore with them to work as a house maid.  After thinking over the matter, T’s mother agreed.  On 3 May T left home with Marni and Vijay.  They spent a few days in Johore Baru, and entered Singapore on 9 May.  Yong Ah Lai, who is Marni’s husband, joined the group after they arrived in Singapore on 9 May.
16.       All of them checked into the Lai Ming Hotel at 424 Geylang Road.  From the next day on, T was made to offer her services as a prostitute in the backlanes of Geylang Road.  They were arrested by officers of the Anti-Vice Branch on 23 May.  Hilan was arrested separately on the same day, and the appellant was arrested on 25 May.
T’s evidence
17.       On the day following her arrival in Singapore she started work as a prostitute.  She was with Vijay and Yong Ah Lai when Hilan came and became her first customer.  They had sex in a room, after which he gave her a tip of $4 and his telephone number.
18.       A few days later, she met Velu through Yong Ah Lai.  Her evidence was that “(o)nce Velu came into the picture, Velu started bringing me” to ply her trade.
 
[1]
19.       Subsequently she met Hilan again.  On this occasion, she was at a backlane and Velu and Yong Ah Lai were standing nearby.  When Hilan approached her Velu went to speak with him.  After they spoke, Velu brought her and Hilan to a room and had sex while Velu waited outside.  Hilan paid $30 including $5 for the room, and Velu let her keep the balance $25.
[2]
20.       On other occasions Velu would collect money from the customers and hand it over to her, and at other times he would collect the payment, pay for the room, and gave her the balance.
 
[3]
21.       T also remembered that Velu had visited the room at Lai Ming Hotel where she stayed with Vijay, Yong Ah Lai and Marni.  On that occasion Velu asked for her passport which he examined and returned.  After it was returned, she discovered that her identity card which was kept inside the passport had been removed.  Subsequently Velu brought the identity card back.  On another occasion, Velu bought a chain for her, and put it around her neck.
 
[4]
Hilan’s evidence
22.       He admitted that he had sex with T on two occasions.  On the first occasion, Yong Ah Lai was involved.  He told him of the price for T’s services, arranged for the room, and received the payment.
 
[5]
23.       After they had sex, he gave her a tip and his handphone number.
24.       About a week later on 18 or 19 May

he met Yong Ah Lai when he was at Lorong 18.  While they were speaking to one another, T came up to him and asked him if he remembered her.  When he confirmed that he did she asked him to follow her to have sex with her.  She led him to a room, and they had sex.
 
[7]
  Velu was not there and he claimed he did not meet Velu till after they were arrested.
Yong Ah Lai’s evidence
25.       He had known Velu since February/March 2002.  He knew that Velu frequented the places where the prostitutes were, and was friendly with them.  He introduced T to Velu while she was prostituting herself.  A few days later Velu went to his room at the Lai Ming Hotel. Velu looked at T’s passport and after he left, it was discovered that T’s identity card was missing from her passport.
26.       On the purchase of T’s chain, he suggested to T that she gave money to Velu to buy the chain for her and T told him that Velu had bought it for her.
27.       Yong Ah Lai made statements to the police after his arrest.  One of those statements recorded on 6 June 2002
 
[8]
 
was admitted in evidence without objections from him.  In this statement, Yong Ah Lai was questioned about the appellant
Q1:       Can you tell me when did you actually get to know ‘Velu’?
A1:       It was sometime towards the end of February 2002 that I got to know ‘Velu’ at Geylang.  He was talking and joking to the prostitutes there.  I decided to talk to him.  I have seen him before on several occasions during my visits to Geylang.  On that day, when I spoke to him, I was asking him as to whether he could recommend any new girls that I could engage.  I would like to say that ‘Velu’ is always around the prostitutes there, he is quite well known among the Indian men there and they would call him ‘9’.  The prostitutes that he always hangs out with are Indians.  I do not know why he was called ‘9’ but whenever I was there, the people there would asked me if I was looking for ‘9’.
Q3:       Can you explain to me as to how did ‘Velu’ help you to take care of the Indian girl when you were not around?
A3:       I told ‘Velu’ to help me to take care of the Indian girl whenever I have to leave the place.  He agreed to do so.  I did not specifically tell ‘Velu’ what to do, I told him to be there and to keep an eye on the Indian girl.  When I returned back to the place, he would not tell me anything but asked me as to where I have gone.
Q8:       Can you tell me how many times did ‘Velu’ help you to take care of the Indian girl when she was prostituting herself?
A8:       Only 2 times.
28.       When Velu cross-examined him on the statement, he explained that “Velu came to see me in the hotel.  So when I took the girl out, he accompanied me as well”
 
[9]
, that “he came to visit me and then subsequently I brought the girl out and he followed me but I cannot remember the case.  On that occasion I was the one who brought the girl out and not him”,
 
[10]
 
that “(h)e did not help me in the work”,
 
[11]
 
and that “I only asked him to help me for a short while when I go and buy things at the shops nearby and he helped me out of friendship.”
 
[12]
  He clarified that he wanted Velu to be around and see that T did not talk or quarrel with the other prostitutes, but “I did not engage his service to procure customers.  I just want him to be there so that nothing will happen.”
 
[13]
  The clarification is significant as it shows that Velu was not with Yong Ah Lai and T by chance, but that he was there to help ensure that there would be no interference with her activities.
29.       That was not the first time Velu had helped him.  He said
While I was at Lorong 18, many Indians there bullied me.  They told me that since I was new there and I wanted to solicit customers for the prostitute, then I have to pay them $30 a day and I indeed gave them $30 a day.  These Indians were Indian nationals and they were also taking care of those prostitutes there.  If I did not give them money, they would bully me.  After I got to know Velu, Velu asked me why did I have to give these Indian nationals money because they were just the same as you, they were also procuring customers for their prostitutes.  As such, from then onwards, I stopped giving money to these Indian nationals and also because of that, I have faith in Velu.  That was why I asked him to take care of the Indian girl when I wasn’t around.
 
[14]
30.       Yong Ah Lai had made reference to Velu when he was questioned by SI Poh Boon Choon on the day he was arrested.  When the prosecution made reference to it in the opening address, he said that he did not make any oral statement to anyone
 
[15]
 
and then he said that he only told the officer that he procured customers for T.
 
[16]
  When SI Poh gave evidence on the taking of the statement, Yong Ah Lai contended that he did not say the things that were attributed to him.
 
[17]
  He accepted that no inducement, threat, promise or oppression was employed,
 
[18]
 
but he alleged that “they have added the name Velu there and also said that I was the one who made arrangements, all these.  I never said all these.  They were just trying to frame me up by adding these words there.”
 
[19]
31.       The words in SI Poh’s record in his field book he was complaining about were
Yong admitted arranging [T] for prostitution with Thankappan and his wife to backlane of Lor 18 Geylang.  He also arranged one pimp Velu to assist in getting clients for [T’s] prostitution.
 
[20]
32.       This statement tied in with his subsequent statement of 6 June
 
[21]
 
referred to in para 27.
33.       After examining and evaluating the evidence of Yong Ah Lai and SI Poh I found that Yong Ah Lai had made reference to Velu to SI Poh and that he had expanded on Velu’s role in his statement of 6 June.
Velu’s statement
34.       The prosecution tendered at the trial a statement made by Velu on 6 June.
 
[22]
  Velu did not object to its admission.
35.       In the statement he admitted that he had taken T’s identity card.  His explanation for his action was
I took her identity card and kept it with me, since I saw her address at Johor and my foreman, Pathmanathan (
sic
) is also from Johor.  I wanted to check with him if he knew this girl and the next day, I met Pathmanathan (
sic
) and I asked him about this girl.  Pathmanathan (
sic
) told me that I should not interfere and it is not our business.  He told me to return the identity card to the girl.  I asked Pathmanathan (
sic
) if he knew the girl, I told him that the girl had came to Singapore to become prostitute and she is still young.
 
[23]
36.       He also admitted that T had given him $20 to buy a chain, and that he bought the chain for her.
Velu’s evidence
37.       Velu is an Indian national, aged 29 years.  He was working as an escalator fitter and electrician and claimed to have a second job as a newspaper delivery man.  He recounted that when he first met Yong Ah Lai with T, T looked young.  When he discovered from her identity card that she had come from Johore he kept the identity card.  His intention was to get his foreman Padmanathan who is also from Johore to find out whether T was in Singapore willingly.
 
[24]
  When he showed the identity card to Padmanathan, he was advised to return the identity card and not interfere in the matter as it does not concern him.
 
[25]
38.       He confirmed that he bought the chain for T
[26]
 
and that he helped Yong Ah Lai by speaking to the Indian nationals
[27]
 
who were demanding payments from him.
Padmanathan’s evidence
39.       Padmanathan’s full name is Padmanathan s/o Paramansivan.  He is a foreman of a lift company and was the only witness called by Velu.  He recalled Velu showing him T’s identity card that “He said that someone had brought the girl and left her at the place.  He said the girl was left at Geylang.  He said the girl appeared young”
 
[28]
 
and “I said that the girl is young and she should not be doing this.  I said that it’s not good for the girl to do this and I told him to do something good for the girl.
 
[29]
40.       The following came out during the brief cross-examination
Q         Did he tell you anything else?
A         He only said this, he did not say anything else.
Q         Did you say anything else to him apart from what you’ve told us?
A:         No, I did not say anything else.
 
[30]
Evaluation of the evidence
41.       I was aware that the prosecution’s case relied substantially on T, a young girl, and that some aspects of her account of her experience in Singapore lacked particulars, for example to dates of events, and to the circumstances in which Velu bought the chain for her.
42.       I was nevertheless satisfied that she was an honest witness, trying her best to remember what happened during that traumatic fortnight when she was separated from family and home brought to Singapore and was made to prostitute herself.  Velu was not involved in deceiving her into coming to Singapore.  There was no animosity or misunderstanding between them for her to make false accusations against him.  I accepted her evidence that Yong Ah Lai and Velu were with her as her pimps when she did that.
43.       I did not accept the evidence of Hilan that on the second occasion he had sex with her, T had come up to him, asked him if he remembered her, then led him to a room to have sex with no mention of price or payment.  This description of the events was at odds to the evidence of Yong Ah Lai and T that some one would always be at hand to oversee her activities.  I did not accept Hilan’s evidence that he did not see Velu on that occasion.
44.       I found that Yong Ah Lai’s evidence in fact supported T’s evidence.  It can be seen from his evidence that Velu was not an innocent observer of the goings-on.  He was frequently in the area, he was known to the prostitutes and he helped Yong Ah Lai stop making payment to the Indian nationals.  He also admitted that he wanted Velu to ensure that T did not talk or quarrel with the other prostitutes.
45.       I was mindful that Velu did not have the benefit of counsel to represent him, and I gave allowance for that.
46.       His own evidence showed that he was not a casual acquaintance of Yong Ah Lai or T.  As I have pointed out, he helped the former stop paying protection money, and he was entrusted to buy a chain for the latter.  He was sufficiently interested in T’s age to take her identity card without asking.  His explanation that he wanted to seek the help of his foreman Padmanathan to check with her family in Johore whether she had came to Singapore voluntarily was inconsistent with Padmanathan’s evidence.  Padmanathan said nothing about being asked to check with T’s family, or telling Velu not to interfere in T’s affairs.  To the contrary Padmanathan told him that it was not good for T to be involved in prostitution, and that he should do something for her.  Velu’s own witness contradicted him.
47.       After reviewing the evidence, I had no doubt that Velu had participated in her prostitution, particularly on the second occasion when Hilan had sex with T by bringing them to the room for the purpose, and waiting outside for them.  I therefore convicted him and Yong Ah Lai for abetting Hilan to rape T.
Sentences
48.       I sentenced Hilan to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the rape charges, with the custodial sentences to run concurrently.
49.       Yong Ah Lai was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the rape abetment charge, with the custodial sentences to run concurrently.  He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined $5000 or six months imprisonment in default on the procurement charge, and a similar sentence for living on the earnings of prostitution, which sentences were to run concurrently between themselves and consecutively with the sentences for the abetment of rape.
50.       I will deal more specifically with the sentence on Velu.  Like the other accused persons, he had no antecedents.  He pleaded in mitigation that he has been working in Singapore for six years and had not committed any offences.  His father has passed away and his mother, sisters, wife and children in India depend on his financial support.
51.       Taking these matters into account, and bearing in mind that he had claimed trial to the charge, as well as the sentencing guidelines set down in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
, as well as the sentences passed on his co-accused, I sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

Sexual abuse of siblings by young offender

Factors to be taken into account when determining sentence.
 
 
Background
 
1 The accused is S, male, 15 years of age. He faced seven charges in relation to three victims. All of the victims were his younger siblings whom I shall refer to as A, B and C respectively. All the offences were alleged to be committed at the accused’s residence.
2 The prosecution proceeded with the third to seventh charges.
3 The third charge was presented under s 377 of the Penal Code i.e for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with A, a female, then 13 years old, when he inserted his penis into her anus sometime in mid June 2002.
4 The fourth charge was presented under the limb of s 376(2) of the Penal Code regarding rape by having sexual intercourse with a woman under 14 years of age without her consent. This involved A, then 12 years old. The offence was committed in 2001.
5 The fifth charge was also presented under the same limb of s 376(2) of the Penal code as the fourth charge. The offence was committed in December 2001 against B, a female, then 11 years old.
6 The sixth charge was presented under s 377 of the Penal Code i.e for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with B, then 11 years old, when he inserted his penis into her anus. The offence was committed at the end of December 2001.
7 The seventh charge was presented under s 354 of the Penal Code i.e for using criminal force on C, male, then 11 years old, intending to outrage his modesty, when the accused repeatedly rubbed his erect penis between the rear of the thighs of C. The offence was committed on 31 July 2002.
8 The offences came to light in the following manner:
(a) two or three days before A lodged a police report on 1 August 2002, she had confided in her classmates that the accused had molested her. As she narrated the incidents of molest, her classmates told her that she had been raped and advised her to inform her parents and teachers. She was reluctant to do so as the accused had threatened to beat her if she told anyone what he had done.
(b) On 31 July 2002, A was at home with the accused and B and C. Their parents had gone out leaving the accused in charge of the home and his siblings.
(c) While A was in the living room, she heard the voice of C (one of the male siblings) coming from the accused’s bedroom. She opened the door and saw the accused lying on top of C. The accused and C were naked. A immediately closed the door as she was afraid that the accused might see and beat her.
(d) A pondered over what her classmates had said and finally decided to report to the police what the accused had been doing.
(e) On 1 August 2002, A lodged a police report that the accused had raped and molested her at home since she was in primary three. She also reported that the last occasion of sexual abuse was on 30 July 2002.
9 The accused pleaded guilty to each of these five charges and was convicted accordingly. He agreed to the remaining two charges i.e the first and second charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The first and second charges were presented under the same limb of s 376(2) of the Penal Code as the fourth charge. The victim was A who was under 14 years of age when the respective offences were committed on or about 30 July 2002 (first charge) and on or about 24 July 2002 (second charge).
10 The accused expressed regret for his actions. He said he knew that, as a brother, he should have taken good care of his siblings and while he was remanded at a boys’ home, he had learned a lot. He was advised to change by the staff there and he asked for a second chance to continue his studies and have a bright future. He asked to be sent to a home instead of prison.
11 Mr Benjamin Yim for the prosecution said that the prosecution had decided to have this case tried in the High Court and not the Juvenile Court because of the circumstances of the case.
My Decision
12 Although the accused was a juvenile as defined under the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38), the nature and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences were serious.
13 According to the Statement of Facts, which the accused accepted, the accused had been entrusted by his parents to look after his siblings as he was the eldest child. He would often beat them with belts and a broomstick. When he sexually abused the three victims, he would threaten to beat them with a belt or a broomstick and on occasions, he would carry out his threat. I need refer only to two occasions of sexual abuse by the accused.
14 On one occasion in 2001, the accused had pulled A into his bedroom and raped her despite her protests. On another occasion in mid-June 2002, the accused had inserted his penis into A’s anus. Although A was in pain and cried out to the accused to stop, he told her to hold on tight to a pillow.
15 The Statement of Facts and the charges showed the accused to be a deviant who used force or the threat of force to abuse his siblings sexually in various ways. This was not a case where he had acted on impulse on one occasion only. In the circumstances, I was of the view that this was not an appropriate case for the accused to be sent to a home only, and that he should be sent to prison.
16 On the term of imprisonment, the Court of Appeal has said in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
 that the starting point for a charge of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code is ten years’ imprisonment for a contested case. A court should then consider any mitigating factors of which a plea of guilty is one and which would merit a reduction of one-quarter to one-third of the sentence. Other factors such as the victim’s youth, the accused’s position of responsibility and trust towards the victim, and perversions or gross indignities forced upon the victim would justify a longer sentence.
17 However, I noted that a charge under s 376(2) of the Penal Code was more serious. Section 376(2) prescribed a minimum imprisonment of not less than eight years and not more than 20 years with caning of not less than 12 strokes. Under s 376(1), there is no minimum term of imprisonment while the maximum term is 20 years. Furthermore, under s 376(1), an accused is only liable to a fine or caning i.e caning is not mandatory although that is usually part of the sentence meted out.
18 As for an offence under s 377 of the Penal Code, the Court of Appeal in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
 upheld consecutive sentences of ten years each for four charges under s 377 involving anal intercourse. However that was a worse case than the case before me in that the accused there was a paedophile, there were five victims and the accused had had previous convictions for similar offences.
19 In 
Adam bin Darsin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 2 SLR 413
, the Court of Appeal said that anal intercourse was a more serious offence than fellatio. Where the fellatio was an act performed on the victim, an appropriate sentence would be in the region of five years, subject to any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. In the case before me, the charges under s 377 involved acts of anal intercourse as in the case of 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
.
20 As for an offence under s 354 of the Penal Code, Chief Justice Yong Pung How had said in 
Ng Chiew Kiat v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 1 SLR 383
 that nine months’ imprisonment and caning is warranted for acts of molest involving intrusion of the victim’s private parts. However, this was not restricted to cases where there was an intrusion of the victim’s private parts. In 
Toh Kok How v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 1 SLR 735
, the accused was sentenced also to nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for using his knuckles to press onto the right breast of the victim. On the other hand, Yong CJ also said in 
Ng Chiew Kiat
 that there were offences under s 354 which were relatively minor for which a fine would suffice. Ultimately, the appropriate sentence would depend on the nature of the act of molest as well as the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.
21 In the case before me, the accused committed the offence under s 354 by pushing his penis between the thighs of C, a male sibling, until the accused ejaculated.
22 I took into account the fact that the accused was in a position of responsibility and trust vis-à-vis the victims but he was not their parent and he was of a young age. I also took into account the fact that he had sexually abused not one but three of his siblings in various ways on various occasions over a number of years.
23 In the circumstances, I sentenced the accused as follows:
(a) On the third charge under s 377 of the Penal Code, seven years’ imprisonment
(b) On the fourth charge under s 376(2) of the Penal Code, ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane
(c) On the fifth charge under s 376(2) of the Penal Code, ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane
(d) On the sixth charge under s 377 of the Penal Code, seven years’ imprisonment
(e) On the seventh charge under s 354 of the Penal code, eight months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
24 The sentences of imprisonment for the fourth and fifth charges were to run consecutively from the date of arrest i.e 2 August 2002. The other sentences were to run concurrently with the consecutive sentences. The aggregate term of imprisonment was 20 years. The number of strokes of the cane was limited to ten strokes in view of s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The caning was to be done with a light rattan as provided under s 229(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code.",2003-03-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

1  The respondent pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a total of three offences, which comprised two counts of trafficking in controlled drugs pursuant to s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (‘MDA’) and one count of consumption of a controlled drug pursuant to s 8 of the MDA. He was convicted and sentenced by District Judge Emily Wilfred (‘the district judge’) to a total of 15 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The respondent appealed against his sentence but this was superseded by an application for criminal revision (CR 11/2003) filed by the district judge pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC’). The application for criminal revision related to the conviction of the respondent upon a wrong charge. I granted the application for criminal revision and set aside the conviction and sentence on the wrong charge. I amended the charge accordingly, then convicted and sentenced the respondent on the charge as amended. I now give my reasons.
 
Background
2  The first charge dated 27 February 2003 (‘the unamended first charge’) upon which the respondent was convicted and sentenced was the subject matter of the application for criminal revision brought by the district judge. The charge concerned s 5 of the MDA. It charged that the respondent:
…did jointly traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, four (04) blocks of vegetable matters weighing approximately 
300 grams
, believed to contain cannabis, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, … thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 and Section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 and punishable under Section 33 of the aforsaid Act. [Emphasis added]
The district judge convicted the respondent on the unamended first charge and sentenced him to 14 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. She also convicted him on a second charge for the possession and consumption of controlled drugs pursuant to s 8 of the MDA and a third charge for trafficking in controlled drugs pursuant to s 5 of the MDA. The sentences imposed for the second and third charges were one year’s imprisonment and five years’ imprisonment with five strokes of the cane respectively. Four other charges for offences under the MDA were taken into consideration with the consent of the respondent by the district judge for the purposes of sentencing. The district judge ordered the terms of imprisonment in respect of the first and second charges to run consecutively, and the term of imprisonment in respect of the third charge to run concurrently for a total of 15 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
3  The respondent had earlier tendered to this Court an amended first charge dated 2 May 2003 (‘the amended first charge’) in support of the now superseded appeal against sentence, which charged that the respondent:
…did jointly traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, two (02) blocks containing 
50.29 grams
 of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, …thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 and Section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 and punishable under Section 33 of the aforsaid Act. [Emphasis added]
This amended first charge dated 2 May 2003 was the charge given to the interpreter to be read to the respondent by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (‘the DPP’) on the first day of the hearing below on 23 June 2003. The respondent proceeded to plead guilty to the amended first charge as it was read to him.
4  The DPP, however, did not tender the amended first charge to the district judge. The amended first charge was at no time in the court file before the district judge. As a result, the district judge wrongly understood the respondent to have pleaded guilty to the unamended first charge and convicted and sentenced him on it accordingly. The conviction of the respondent therefore related to a wrong charge.
5  The first simple but material difference between the unamended first charge and the amended first charge related to the quantity of controlled drugs reflected in the charge to be in the possession of the respondent for the purpose of trafficking. The other difference related to the quality of the controlled drugs said to be in the possession of the respondent for the purpose of trafficking. The first charge was for the possession for the purpose of trafficking of ‘four (04) blocks of vegetable matters weighing 
approximately
 
300
 grams, 
believed to contain cannabis
’, whereas the amended first charge was for the possession for the purpose of trafficking of ‘two (02) blocks containing 
50.29
 grams of vegetable matter 
which was analysed and found to be cannabis
’ [Emphases added]. The unamended first charge was obviously very vaguely worded.
6  It was undisputed before me that at the time of the respondent’s guilty plea on 23 June 2003, it was the understanding of both the prosecution and the respondent that the respondent’s guilty plea was to the amended first charge that referred to 50.29 grams of cannabis. It was also clear to me that the charge which the prosecution proceeded with against the respondent was the amended first charge, since it was the charge given to the interpreter by the DPP to be read out to the respondent on the first day of the trial.
7  Importantly, the evidence did not support the unamended first charge. The amalgamated statement of facts and the Health Sciences Authority’s reports (‘HSA reports’) of the substances found in the possession of the respondent made reference to a quantity of 50.29 grams of cannabis in support the first charge proceeded against the respondent. There was no reference anywhere to four blocks of vegetable matters weighing 300 grams believed to be cannabis.
8  
Counsel for the respondent subsequently discovered that the district judge had convicted the respondent on the unamended first charge and wrote in for clarification. The district judge duly called for a meeting with counsel in chambers. It was ascertained in chambers on 28 August 2003 that the unamended first charge was in fact a ‘holding charge’ preferred against the respondent upon his arrest pending the completion of investigations. Such charges are invariably amended upon the completion of investigations to reflect accurately the evidence that supports the charge to be actually proceeded with against the accused. This was in fact done in the present case on 2 May 2003. Unfortunately, the amended first charge did not find its way into the trial court file as the DPP did not tender it to the district judge on the first day of trial.
9  Following this meeting, the district judge made an application for criminal revision pursuant to s 268 of the CPC on 2 September 2003 to this Court. This application was supported by the Public Prosecutor, the petitioner here.
Criminal Revision
10  Following from the above, it was patently clear to me that the district judge convicted and sentenced the respondent on the wrong charge. The respondent should not have been convicted and sentenced on the unamended first charge for the following reasons:
(i) The conviction and sentence below were founded upon a wrong charge. The respondent had pleaded guilty to the amended first charge as read to him by the interpreter on 23 June 2003 at the hearing below, and 
not to the charge he was subsequently convicted and sentenced upon
.
(ii) The prosecution had proceeded with the amended first charge against the respondent, and not the unamended first charge.
(iii) The prosecution had understood the respondent’s plea of guilt to relate to the amended first charge as read out to the respondent on 23 June 2003.
(iv) The amalgamated statement of facts and the HSA reports did not support the quantity and quality of controlled drugs disclosed on the unamended first charge.
11  In contemplating whether to exercise the power of criminal revision in the present case, I took into account s 396 of the CPC. This section provides that no finding or sentence made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of any error or irregularity in the charge unless the error or irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice. I read this section together with s 162 of the CPC, which provides that no error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error.
12  Considering these two provisions in relation to the facts, it was clear to me that the charge upon which the district judge convicted and sentenced the respondent below had occasioned a failure of justice, for reasons that will follow, such that the finding and sentence of the district judge should  be reversed. There was also no doubt in my mind that the differences between the unamended first charge and the amended first charge were material errors as the respondent was in fact misled into thinking that he was being convicted on the amended first charge. The discrepancies between the charges were not so minor such that they could rightly be regarded as immaterial, as was the case in 
PP v Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed
 
[2000] 3 SLR 17
. Sections 396 and 162 of the CPC therefore presented no difficulty for the exercise of criminal revision here.
13  I went on to consider the law on the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. I have held in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 and 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 that the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court exists to right serious injustice. As I have stated in 
Ang Poh Chuan
, there is no precise definition of what constitutes serious injustice and a wide discretion is vested in the High Court, the exercise of which depends largely on the particular facts of the case. But ‘generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below’. This statement has been endorsed and applied in subsequent cases and the same principle was reiterated recently in 
PP v Henry John William and another appeal
 
[2002] 1 SLR 290
.
14  The present situation was clearly a proper case for the exercise of the revisionary power, as the respondent was convicted and sentenced upon a wrong charge which resulted in a failure of justice flowing from the material discrepancies between the unamended first charge and the amended first charge. This was notwithstanding the fact that the minimum and maximum sentences upon a conviction for either the amended first charge or the unamended first charge are the same – being five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane and 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane respectively pursuant to s 33 of the MDA.
15  This was because the primary consideration of the sentencing court in deciding an appropriate sentence for a drug trafficking offence is the quantity of drugs in the possession of the offender. The district judge referred to 
Ang Soon Huat
, CC 34/87, an unreported judgment dated 2 November 1990, where the High Court stated that:
…the gravity of the offence of drug trafficking lay not in the personal circumstances in which the offender committed the offence, like in many other offences, 
but simply in the amount that was trafficked
…Therefore it must follow, that in the ordinary case where there are no exceptional circumstances affecting the offender’s conduct, the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence, which is the quantity of the drugs that is being trafficked in.
The fact that the unamended first charge related to 300 grams of what was believed to be cannabis therefore weighed heavily on the mind of the district judge in sentencing the respondent to 14 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. Such a sentence was in line with the existing sentencing benchmarks for such quantities of cannabis.
16  I was therefore not in doubt that had the correct charge bearing one-sixth of  the quantity of cannabis been before the district judge, the sentence imposed upon the respondent below for that charge would have been substantially less. It was a manifest failure of justice, as such, to impose a sentence upon the respondent that he did not deserve based on a plea of guilt to a charge which he did not actually plead guilty to.
Powers of criminal revision
17  The relevant statutory provisions dealing with the revisionary powers of the High Court are s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and s 268 of the CPC. In particular, s 268 of the CPC reads as follows:
(1) The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate in his own defence.
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
18  Having decided that the present case warranted an exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, I moved on to correct the injustice which had arisen by exercising the powers under s 256 of the CPC given to me in the context of a criminal revision, which provides as follows:
At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may –
(a) in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse the order and direct that further inquiry shall be made or that the accused shall be retried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law;
(b) in an appeal from a conviction –
(i) …
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or
(iii) …
19  It is a matter of logic, which I am now stating for the avoidance of doubt, that the exercise of these powers in the context of a criminal revision are not bound by the circumstances under which they would normally arise in the context of this Court’s appellate jurisdiction. As such the powers granted to High Court under s 256(a) of the CPC here need not ‘arise in an appeal from an order of acquittal’, neither would the powers under s 256(b) only be exercisable ‘in an appeal from a conviction’.
 
Altering the finding by amending the charge
20  Section 256 of the CPC grants the High Court wide powers in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. These powers include the power to amend a charge and consequently convict an accused person on the amended charge. This is clear from the cases of 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
, 
Loo Weng Fatt v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 313
 and 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
.
21  In its revisionary jurisdiction, the High Court also has the power to ‘alter the finding’ of the lower court by amending the charge and thereafter to convict an accused person on the amended charge without ordering a re-trial pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC. This was my holding in 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
. The facts there were similar to the present case. In 
Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
, the accused person had pleaded guilty to an offence different from that which both the prosecution and defence had intended to proceed under due to a clerical error. It was not disputed that the charge was wrongly presented and that the respondent had pleaded guilty to that charge by mistake. In that case the wrong charge disclosed a different offence from the actual offence committed, which resulted in a heavier sentence given to the accused by the magistrate. The finding that the respondent in 
Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 was guilty of the offence under the wrong charge was therefore patently wrong and could not be permitted to stand and I set aside the conviction and sentence which flowed from the mistaken plea of guilt. Likewise, the conviction and sentence imposed on the respondent in the present case must be set aside as the error in the charge resulted in a significantly heavier sentence being imposed on him below. Further, and significantly, the respondent here did not even mistakenly plead guilty to the wrong charge. He had entered a plea of guilt in relation to the amended charge that was read out to him on the understanding that that would be the charge he would be convicted and sentenced upon.  It bears repeating that the conviction and sentence were founded upon a wrong charge, and therefore could not be allowed to stand.
22  Having set aside the conviction and sentence below on the wrong charge, I considered that this was a proper case for me to amend the charge as requested by the petitioner, and thereafter to convict and sentence the respondent on the amended charge. I held, in 
Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
, that the revisionary capacity to ‘alter the finding’ pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) of the High Court included the power to correct errors in the charge. Indeed, the High Court should be able to amend the charge to reflect the fact that it has altered the finding of the lower court, such that the altered finding conforms with what the correct or appropriate charge should be, having regard to the evidence adduced. Since correcting the errors in the present charge did not require the introduction of an entirely different offence, amending the charge was a relatively straightforward exercise.  Accordingly, I amended the charge in the presence of the respondent to read as it should have at trial, disclosing an offence of possession for the purposes of trafficking of ‘two (2) blocks containing 50.29 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis’ pursuant to s 5 of the MDA.
23  In amending the charge, I was mindful of the fact that the power of amendment to a charge is subject to restrictions in order to protect the interests of the accused. The case law is clear on this (see 
Ng Ee v PP
 
[1941] MLJ 180
, 
Sivalingam v PP
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 172
 as applied in 
Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
). The power of amendment is not unfettered and should be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against prejudice to the defence. I was satisfied that the proceedings below would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded would have been the same upon confirmation that the respondent would plead guilty to the amended charge. Although the amended charge was identical to the charge the respondent had intended to plead guilty to below, seeking such confirmation was important because a new and different charge is in the place of the unamended first charge. Upon the confirmation of the plea of guilt to the amended charge, I was further satisfied that no question of prejudice arose since the sentence for the charge in question would be dramatically reduced as a consequence of the amendment.
Conviction and sentence
24  Following from this plea of guilt, I convicted and pronounced a fresh sentence on the respondent upon the amended charge pursuant to s 256(a) of the CPC.  Section 256(a) of the CPC allows the High Court, in the context of its appellate jurisdiction, to find the accused ‘guilty and pass sentence on him according to law’ in an appeal from an order of acquittal. These same powers are exercisable in the context of criminal revision pursuant to s 268 of the CPC. I now turn to the question of sentence.
25  I sentenced the respondent to six years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane on the amended charge, having regard to the sentencing benchmarks for offences involving similar quantities of cannabis. Such a sentence was a proportionate response to the offence disclosed by the amended charge. I found no reason to disturb the district judge’s ruling that the terms of imprisonment in respect of the first and second charges are to run consecutively, and the term of imprisonment in respect of the third charge to run concurrently. The total sentence the respondent would serve in respect of all three charges proceeded against him would  therefore be seven years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
26  In light of the foregoing, I granted the application for criminal revision, set aside the conviction and sentence below, amended the erroneous charge, and duly convicted the respondent on the amended charge before pronouncing a fresh sentence accordingly.

Lai Kew Chai J:
 
This was an appeal against the decision of Woo Bih Li J in which he found the accused (“Soosainathan”) guilty of the following charge:
That you, Soosainathan s/o Dass Saminathan, on the 5
th
 day of August 2002, between 12.00am and 6.14am at Blk 629 Hougang Avenue 8 #09-82 Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Anjeli Elisaputri, a 6 month-old Indonesian female infant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224)
2          At the time of his arrest, Soosainathan was just under 41 years old, single and unemployed. He was the owner of Blk 629 Hougang Avenue 8 #09-82 (“the Flat”). At 6.14am on 5 August 2002, police officers from the Hougang Neighbourhood Police Centre were despatched to attend to the disappearance of a six month-old female infant named Anjeli Elisaputri (“the baby”). The complainant was the baby’s mother, an Indonesian female named Widiyarti Binti Kartanom (“Widiyarti”).
3          The police officers found the baby in a bin at the bottom of a rubbish chute connected to the Flat. Her body was wrapped in a green towel and covered by a brown coloured bedsheet. The baby was found hog-tied. Her wrists and ankles were bound together in a ‘hogtie’, behind her back, with a white ligature. She was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic. The baby’s death was due to a severe head injury caused by a fall from a height, with primary impact upon the top of her head.
The Prosecution’s case
4          The prosecution proceeded on s 300(b) and (d) of the Penal Code. Its version of events was that Soosainathan had taken the baby from Widiyarti while she was sleeping in the guestroom of the Flat. He brought the baby to his bedroom, tied her up and administered drugs to her in order to keep her quiet. He then proceeded to sexually assault her. When Widiyarti confronted him the next morning and asked where the baby was, he told her to follow him downstairs to report the matter to the police. He then left the Flat.
5          This was a ploy to get Widiyarti out of the Flat. While she was downstairs calling the police, Soosainathan returned to the Flat and wrapped the baby in a green towel and a brown bedsheet. He then dropped her down the rubbish chute which was located in the Flat’s kitchen. The baby died as a result of a head injury suffered during her fall down the rubbish chute.
The Defence’s case
6            Soosainathan admitted that he had taken the baby into his bedroom. However, he claimed that Widiyarti subsequently took the baby from his bedroom while he was sleeping. She was accompanied by a man (referred to as “Mr X” by the trial judge). The defence argued that it could have been Widiyarti and Mr X who had dropped the baby into the Flat’s rubbish chute.
Widiyarti’s evidence
7          The prosecution’s primary witness was Widiyarti. Her evidence was that on 4 August 2002, she and the baby were staying in the guestroom of the Flat. At about 11.30pm, Soosainathan (whom Widiyarti referred to as “Cho Cho”) unlocked and opened the guestroom door. He took the baby away from her, brought the baby into his bedroom and closed the bedroom door.
8            Widiyarti allowed Soosainathan to take the baby because she was afraid that he would scold her if she tried to stop him. When she heard the baby crying, she knocked on the bedroom door and asked Soosainathan to return her daughter to her. The baby stopped crying after a while. Widiyarti then sat down in the living room to wait for Soosainathan to return baby to her. She knocked again on the bedroom door at about 2.00am. She subsequently fell asleep on the living room sofa and woke up at about 5.00am.
9          At about 6.00am, Widiyarti again knocked on the bedroom door and asked for the baby. Soosainathan opened the door and told her that the baby was still sleeping. She did not believe him as she could look into the bedroom, but did not see the baby. She saw two pillows on the bed, which was covered by a brown coloured bedsheet. She also saw a black coloured bag on a chair. After Widiyarti repeatedly asked where the baby was, Soosainathan said that someone had come and taken the baby away.
10            Soosainathan then suggested that they report the matter to the police. He walked out of the Flat and asked Widiyarti to follow him downstairs. She refused to do so. After Soosainathan left the Flat, she gathered her belongings and walked down the stairs to the ground floor of the block. She used a public phone to inform the police that her daughter was missing. Before the police arrived, Widiyarti disposed of an Indonesian passport that she had in her possession by throwing it into a dustbin. She had intended to give the passport to her husband (“Jalil”) in order to allow him to travel to Batam. Jalil was an overstayer  in Singapore. They had planned to settle down in Batam. While she was waiting for the police to arrive, she saw Soosainathan walking down a staircase from the Flat.
11        The police officers arrived at the scene about 10 minutes later and questioned Widiyarti, after which they proceeded to the Flat. The iron grille was locked even though Widiyarti did not lock it when she left the Flat. She used a key to unlock the grille and the officers searched the Flat. However, the bedroom door was locked. When Soosainathan returned to the Flat, the officers told him to open the bedroom door. Widiyarti told the police that the black coloured bag and the brown bedsheet were no longer in the bedroom.
12            Widiyarti stated that before Soosainathan had taken the baby from her, she had spoken to Jalil once over the telephone. Jalil told her that he would not be coming to the Flat to visit her. Widiyarti claimed that she did not quarrel with Jalil over the phone on this matter.
Soosainathan’s evidence
13            Soosainathan was the only witness for the defence. He was a friend of Jalil, and thus allowed Widiyarti and her daughter to stay in his home when they came over from Batam. He described his relationship with Widiyarti as that of brother and sister. He emphasised that he had no reason to harm the baby.
14            Soosainathan admitted that he took the baby from the guestroom at 11.00pm on 4 August 2002. However, this was done with Widiyarti’s permission, who was still awake. He had taken the baby to his bedroom because Widiyarti was depressed and angry after she had quarrelled with Jalil over the phone. He went to sleep at about 11.45pm.
15        At about 12.30am, Widiyarti and Mr X came into the bedroom. She took the baby away, along with the pillow which the baby was sleeping on. In his cautioned statement recorded on 6 August 2002, Soosainathan stated that Mr X was Jalil. However, in his oral evidence, Soosainathan changed his testimony and said that Mr X was not Jalil, but was someone who looked like Jalil.
16        In the early hours of the morning of 5 August 2002, Widiyarti knocked on his bedroom door. When he opened the door, she asked him where the baby was. He told her that she and Mr X had taken the baby away the night before. When she became agitated, he told her that they should both go downstairs to report the matter to the police.However, when he left the Flat, Widiyarti was still looking for her slippers. He thus took the lift down to the first floor without her. While he was on his way to the police station, he received a call from the police on his handphone telling him that Widiyarti was in the Flat. He immediately returned to the Flat and found the police officers there. After the police searched the Flat, he was taken away and was subsequently placed under arrest.
The decision below
17        The judge below stated that he was irresistibly drawn by the relevant circumstantial evidence to the conclusion that Soosainathan was guilty of murder. He accepted Widiyarti’s evidence.  He found that it was Soosainathan who had dropped the baby into the rubbish chute, and had thereby caused the baby’s death. In order to hide his guilt, Soosainathan concocted the existence of Mr X and gave a fabricated account of how Widiyarti had taken the baby from him. However, it soon became clear that Jalil had an alibi for that night. Soosainathan thus changed his position: Mr X was someone who looked like Jalil, but was not Jalil.
18        The judge also relied on other circumstantial evidence which together with the evidence of Widiyarti  cumulatively proved  Soosainathan’s guilt. Such evidence is summarised below.
Presence of drugs in the baby’s blood
19        The baby’s blood was tested positive for two types of sedative drugs: Chlorpheniramine and Diphenhydramine. The large doses found in the baby’s blood – the level of Chlorpheniramine was over 25 times the normal therapeutic level – suggested that the drugs were administered to keep the baby quiet for a sinister reason. Both of these medicines were prescribed by the Hougang Polyclinic to Soosainathan on 17 June 2002, when he complained of a cough and cold.
DNA evidence
20        The baby’s blood was found on a towel and on two pillows which were seized by the police from a bedroom in  the Flat. Soosainathan’s blood was also found on the towel, and on one of the pillows. This evidence pointed to the baby having been assaulted in Soosainathan’s bedroom.
The brown bedsheet
21            Soosainathan could not satisfactorily explain why the mattress in his bedroom was not fitted with a bedsheet, even though he had several bedsheets in the Flat. There was a light blue bedsheet in the bedroom, but it was lying loose on top of the bare mattress. It was reasonable to conclude that the brown bedsheet which was used to wrap the baby’s body was the same bedsheet that Soosainathan had used for the mattress in his bedroom.
Soosainathan’s skill at tying knots
22        The knots which were used to ‘hogtie’ the baby were not typical, and a layman would not know how to tie such knots unless he was taught by someone else. While he was working as a rigger, Soosainathan had been trained in various methods of tying and slinging ropes.
Issues on appeal
23        Before us, counsel for Soosainathan argued that the judge erred in finding that Widiyarti was a credible witness in view of the discrepancies and illogical explanations in her evidence. The following points were made:-
(a)  Widiyarti was worried about her baby but was content to wait over six hours in the living room, and still had the presence of mind to call the police.
(b)  She was allegedly frantic in the morning, but was still lucid enough to dispose of her false Indonesian passport.
(c)  She was initially a suspect in the investigation.
(d)  A police officer, one Station Inspector Venubalan, ordered the rubbish chute to be searched because of “information provided by the complainant”, which suggested that Widiyarti knew where the baby’s body could be found.
(e)  She was a scheming individual, capable of carrying out devious plans.
24        But the evidence highlighted the following points:-
(a)  The suggestion to call the police came from Soosainathan, not Widiyarti. Furthermore, during those six hours, she knocked on Soosainathan’s door repeatedly and asked him to return the baby to her. Part of the reason why she was in the living room for so long was because she had dozed off on the sofa while waiting.
(b)  The fact that Widiyarti disposed of the fake Indonesian passport had no bearing on her frantic state of mind. Furthermore, her disposal was neither cunning nor innovative. She merely threw it into a dustbin. That was hardly evidence of the kind of mental clarity which counsel for Soosainathan imputed to her.
(c)  The fact that Widiyarti was originally a suspect merely proved that the police conducted a thorough investigation.
(d)  Station Inspector Venubalan
 emphatically stated during cross-examination that Widiyarti did not say or hint that the baby’s body was in the rubbish chute.
(e)  That Widiyarti was willing to procure a false passport for her husband to return to Batam could in no way suggest that she was willing to murder her own infant daughter.
25        In our view, the judge was entitled to accept Widiyarti’s versions of events, and to reject Soosainathan’s evidence.
26        He had considered the inconsistencies in her testimony, and accepted that not every aspect of her evidence was accurate. Nevertheless, he found that she was a credible witness and accepted her version of events. In contrast, the judge found that Soosainathan had resorted to fabricating evidence in order to profess his innocence.
27        It was submitted on behalf of Soosainathan that the judge erred in finding that the evidential burden had shifted to the defence to prove that Widiyarti had taken the baby, and to show how the baby’s body ended up in the rubbish bin. The contention was that the burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt did not shift from the prosecution throughout the trial.
28        This argument was without substance. In the first place, the judge did not hold that the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt had shifted to the defence, nor did he hold that the evidential burden had shifted to Soosainathan to explain how the baby’s body had ended up in the rubbish bin. He only stated that Soosainathan bore the burden of establishing that it was Widiyarti who had taken the baby. The exact words used by the judge in the grounds of decision were these:
Be that as it may, what was more significant was that the accused did take the baby into his bedroom at about 11.30pm of 4 August 2002. This was not disputed. Therefore, 
the evidential burden shifted to the accused to establish that at about 12.30am of 5 August 2002, Widiyarti and Mr X came to his bedroom whereupon Widiyarti took the baby away
, 
although the legal burden remained always with the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt
. [Emphasis added]
29        More importantly, the judge did not err in holding that the evidential burden had shifted to the defence. In 
Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR 645
, the court held that an accused bears an evidential burden to raise the issue of alibi if he is relying on it as a defence. This was clarified in 
Public Prosecutor v Chong Siew Chin
 
[2002] 1 SLR 117
 to mean that the accused “had to raise a reasonable doubt” as to his presence during the alleged offence.
30            Furthermore, on the evidence, it was Soosainathan who urged the court to believe that Widiyarti and Mr X had taken the baby from the bedroom. In our view Soosainathan should bear the evidential burden of proving this particular fact, in order to raise reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case. Section 105 of the Evidence Act states:
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.
31        In this appeal, it was argued that the scientific and forensic evidence was “equivocal and did not definitively establish any irresistible conclusion”. In particular,  issue was taken with the forensic pathologist’s assessment that the baby had been sexually assaulted. Counsel for Soosainathan claimed that the forensic pathologist was not qualified to make such an assessment as this was his first experience with a case of this nature.
32        This argument was without merit. The forensic pathologist was Dr Gilbert Lau, a senior pathologist with the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine. The mere fact that Dr Lau had never conducted an examination of a ‘hogtied’ six month-old infant with a torn hymen did not entitle Soosainathan to cast doubt on his professional opinion and judgment. Dr Lau’s opinion had often been relied on in criminal cases. In fact, Dr Lau’s professional opinion was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a recent case in which the trial judge disregarded Dr Lau’s opinion and substituted it with his own: 
Saeng-Un Udom v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 3 SLR 1
.
33            Furthermore, the following important facts were established by the scientific and forensic evidence:
(a)  The autopsy report concluded that the baby’s death was due to a severe head injury which was caused by a fall from a height. This was consistent with the baby having been dropped down the Flat’s rubbish chute.
(b)  DNA testing showed that the baby’s blood contained high levels of two sedative drugs: Chlorpheniramine and Diphenhydramine. Both of these drugs had previously been prescribed to Soosainathan.
(c)  DNA testing revealed that two pillows found in Soosainathan’s bedroom were stained with the baby’s blood and the accused’s blood was found on one of them.
(d)  The baby’s and the accused’s blood was found on a towel hanging on a raffia string in the accused’s bedroom.
(e)  The autopsy report concluded that there was evidence of sexual interference, with tearing of the baby’s hymen and vaginal penetration.
34            Soosainathan failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the incriminating scientific and forensic evidence outlined above. His explanations were illogical and unconvincing. The judge was entitled to find that Soosainathan had fabricated evidence in order to exonerate himself.
35        On the presence of Chlorpheniramine and Diphenhydramine in the baby’s blood, Soosainathan claimed that he had previously given one of the drugs to Widiyarti to use. She had allegedly put it into an Eye-Mo bottle. The suggestion was that the drugs were found in the baby’s blood because Widiyarti had previously used the Eye-Mo bottle to administer the drugs to the baby when she was ill.
36        We agreed with the judge that this was a fabrication. Save for Soosainathan’s assertions, there was no evidence that the baby was ill. He admitted that he had never seen Widiyarti use the Eye-Mo bottle on the baby. He could not explain the presence of Chlorpheniramine in the baby’s blood, as that drug was not in liquid form and thus could not be stored in the Eye-Mo bottle. In fact, there was no evidence of any Eye-Mo bottle in the Flat when it was searched by the police.
37            Soosainathan claimed that the bloodstained items found in his bedroom had been planted there by Widiyarti before the police arrived. His version of the events was that, when Widiyarti came into the bedroom to take the baby away, she also took a pillow from his bed. She re-entered the bedroom about an hour later and took a towel which was hanging from a raffia string and threw it into a pail in the bathroom. She proceeded to hang a green towel in its place before leaving the bedroom. When Soosainathan left the Flat to call the police, Widiyarti placed the bloodstained pillow on his bed. When the police arrived, they threw the pillows and mattress onto the floor, and emptied the contents of the bathroom pail.
38            Soosainathan’s version of the events stretched credulity. He was unable to explain why the baby’s blood was found on both pillows in his bedroom, and not only on the pillow which Widiyarti had allegedly taken with her.  He was also unable to give the correct colour of the towel that Widiyarti had allegedly hung on the raffia string. Furthermore, it was highly unlikely that the police had tampered with the crime scene by throwing the pillows and towel onto the floor in the manner described.
39            Counsel for Soosainathan contended that the judge failed to consider the fact that “the most accurate estimated time of death by [the forensic pathologist] fell outside the alleged time of commission of the offence”. The prosecution’s case was that Soosainathan threw the baby down the rubbish chute while Widiyarti went downstairs to call the police from the public phone. As such, the time of the offence must have been at or about 6.00am, and not between 3.00 and 5.00am. which the forensic pathologist said was a possible time frame. This argument, however,  ignored the entire evidence of the forensic pathologist. On re-examination, forensic pathologist unequivocally agreed that the death could also have occurred at about 6.00am in the morning, and that the time of death was only given as an estimate.
40        It was also submitted that the prosecution had failed to put its case to Soosainathan regarding the time of commission of the offence. He relied on the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 
[1893] 6 R 67
, which has been accepted as an important principle of our law: see 
Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor
 
[1999] 4 SLR 111
. The rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 requires that:
[A]ny matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief`: 
Cross & Tapper on Evidence
 (8th Ed, 1995) at p 319.
41        The rationale behind the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 was that a witness should not be impeached upon a matter which he has not had any opportunity to explain, by reason of there having been no suggestion that his story was not accepted. However, Soosainathan suffered no injustice from the prosecution’s failure to put the exact time of death to him because it was always clear that his story was not accepted.
42        It mattered not that no attempt was made to impeach the credit of Soosainathan against the numerous statements which he had given to the police. The police recorded six statements from Soosainathan after his cautioned statement was recorded (“the additional statements”). During the trial below, the defence argued that the additional statements must have been consistent with his oral evidence because the prosecution had failed to use them to impeach his credit. The judge did not accept this argument, and held that it was unsafe to infer that every material aspect of Soosainathan’s oral evidence had been disclosed in the additional statements. He also noted that Soosainathan did not ask the prosecution for the additional statements, nor did he apply to court for them.
43            Admittedly, there was no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) for the discovery by an accused of documents in the possession of the prosecution: 
Tan Khee Koon v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
. If an accused wanted to obtain copies of his own police statements, he should have applied to the court under s 58(1) of the CPC for a summons to be issued: 
Kulwant v Public Prosecutor
 
[1986] SLR 239
, 
[1986] 2 MLJ 10
. It was established that the proper time for such an application to be made was after the defence witnesses had finished giving evidence, as there was no longer any question of the defence tailoring evidence at that stage: 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
.
44            Accordingly, this ground of appeal was also without merit. The law presupposed that an accused who wished to obtain his own police statements would make an application for such statements. In the present case, Soosainathan never applied for the additional statements to be produced. It would not be right to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution under such circumstances.
Circumstantial evidence
45        At times, a prosecution’s case would be based entirely on circumstantial evidence. As long as the cumulative effect of all the evidence leads to the irresistible conclusion that it was the accused who committed the crime, then his conviction must stand: 
Ang Sunny v Public Prosecutor
 
[1965-1968] SLR 67
, 
[1966] 2 MLJ 95
.  Like the trial judge, we were irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that Soosainathan was guility of the murder of the baby.
Conclusion
46        For these reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

1          This was an appeal against conviction. On 12 March 2003, the appellant claimed trial and was convicted on two charges of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was sentenced to a total of six years imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. I dismissed his appeal and now give my reasons.
 
Agreed facts
2          At about 10.25pm on 16 October 2002, one Tan Kian Ming (“Tan”) was arrested by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers along Bedok North Avenue 1. The CNB officers conducted a search on his person. 60 tablets and five packets of crystalline substances, suspected to be controlled drugs, were found and seized. Tan admitted that he had received the drugs from a male Chinese in a white car at the car park of Block 36 Chai Chee Avenue 1. He was to deliver the drugs on behalf of this male Chinese, and would collect $1,070 in payment. Upon analysis, the Health Sciences Authority confirmed that the said drugs contained 0.5 grams of Methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug, and Ketamine, a Class B controlled drug.
Prosecution’s case
3          Tan was the prosecution’s main witness. Tan said that he first met the person who supplied the drugs to him about a month before his arrest. This person asked Tan to deliver ecstasy and ketamine for him. Prior to 16 October 2002, Tan met him on four occasions to collect and deliver drugs for him. On 16 October 2002, as prearranged, he picked Tan up at the Bedok Interchange in a white car, and drove Tan to Block 40 Chai Chee Avenue 1. He instructed Tan to alight and deliver the drugs to a contact at the playground of Block 40, and to collect $1,070 in payment.
4          Whilst waiting for his contact to arrive, Tan was arrested at about 10.30pm, and the drugs were found on him. He was questioned by a CNB officer, one ASP Mathew Lim (“ASP Lim”), in the presence of another CNB officer, at 11.00pm. Tan told the CNB officers that the white car was waiting for him behind Block 36 Chai Chee Avenue 1.
5          After recording the statement, ASP Lim received a call from one of his officers, Inspector Richard Soh (“Insp Soh”), who reported that he had seen Tan alight from a white sports car prior to his arrest. In court, Insp Soh also testified that the car had a blue light when the door was opened. He was not able to see the driver of the white car clearly. After Tan’s arrest, Insp Soh instructed the other CNB officers to look out for a white sports car.
6          The white sports car was later spotted by another officer, one Staff Sergeant Justin Fong (“SSgt Fong”), at Block 36. Upon notification of this, Insp Soh proceeded to the carpark of Block 36 with a few other officers. There were three white cars in the carpark, but the engines of the other two cars were cool. The appellant was subsequently seen walking towards the white car. When he opened the door, the light was blue. The appellant was then arrested. Upon arrest, he claimed that he had been visiting a friend on the 11
th
 floor of Block 36. When the officers visited the unit on the 11
th
 floor, they found a transvestite, Chia Hock Leong Michelle (“Michelle”), who said that she had just performed oral sex on the appellant.
7          Tan was brought in a van to Block 36, where he identified the white car as being the white car that he had alighted from after collecting the drugs. He was then escorted to the 11
th
 floor of Block 36. Insp Soh also gave instructions for the appellant to be brought to the 11
th
 floor for identification by Tan. On the 11
th
 floor, with the appellant standing about two to five metres away, Tan identified him as the person who had earlier handed the drugs to him in the white car. He then made a further statement at 11.50pm to ASP Lim. In this statement, Tan identified the appellant as the person who had handed the drugs to him in a car, referring to him as “Ah Goh”. He also identified a white Subaru Impreza bearing registration number SCN 3128L as the car. Another officer, one Sergeant Cherynn Lim (“Sgt Lim”), was present, and signed the statement as a witness.
8          In a second statement given on the following day to the investigating officer of the case, Staff Sergeant Mohd Ferdhouse (“SSgt Ferdhouse”), Tan again admitted that the appellant was the person who had handed him the drugs. Referring to the appellant as “Ah Goh”, Tan agreed to testify against him, saying he was positive that it was the appellant who had given him the drugs.
The defence
9          The appellant denied both charges against him. He claimed that he had become acquainted with a person by the name of Michelle through a chatline prior to 16 October 2002. On 16 October 2002, he spoke to Michelle on the phone and agreed to go to her place after 10.00pm. At about 10.00pm, he left his home to meet Michelle, telling his mother that he was going to meet a friend. He drove his car, a white Subaru Impreza, arriving at Block 36 Chai Chee Avenue 1 at about 10.25 to 10.30pm. Since this was his first visit to the area, he decided to drive around in order to determine whether there was a carpark nearer to Block 36. After driving to Block 40, he realised that the other carpark at Block 36 was nearer, and so drove back to Block 36.
10        After making a phone call to Michelle to ascertain her actual address, he went to her flat, staying there for about 30 to 45 minutes. When he returned to his car, he was arrested by the CNB officers, and brought to the 11
th
 floor of Block 36 where he saw Tan for the first time in his life. He saw a few officers questioning Tan aggressively, and also heard hitting sounds as he was standing besides the lift.
11        The appellant was placed under arrest and brought to Clementi Police Station, where he met Tan in the lock-up. He demanded to know why Tan had implicated him, but Tan remained silent. He met Tan at the Cantonment Police Station the next day, where he spoke to him on two occasions, telling Tan not to accuse him falsely. Tan again remained silent. The following day, he again met Tan and questioned him. This time, Tan apologised, saying that he was shocked and frightened on the day of his arrest because the officers had assaulted him. Tan assured the appellant that he would tell the truth in court.
 
The trial b
elow
12        Once he was on the stand, Tan asserted that the appellant was not “Ah Seng”, the person who had supplied him with the drugs. He claimed that he had only identified the appellant as Ah Seng because he had been assaulted by about ten police officers and was high on drugs at the time. He explained that he had concocted the person of “Ah Goh” when giving his statements to SSgt Ferdhouse, because he had been assaulted and was afraid of further assault by other police officers if he said that his statements to ASP Lim were untrue.
13        Upon cross-examination, Tan denied that he had been offered money to testify for the appellant, or that he had changed his evidence in order to save the appellant from prosecution. He had not met the appellant before 16 October and had not spoken to the appellant when he was at the Clementi Police Station. However, he had met the appellant in the lock up of the Subordinate Courts, whereupon the appellant had asked him why he had identified the wrong person. Tan then told the appellant that he had done so because he was high on drugs when he gave his statement.
14        In light of the inconsistencies between Tan’s evidence in court and his statements to the CNB officers, the trial judge granted the prosecution’s application to impeach Tan’s credit. Consequently, Tan’s two statements to the CNB officers were admitted as substantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
Criminal motion to adduce fresh evidence
15        At the initial hearing before me, counsel for the appellant requested an adjournment of the hearing so as to file a criminal motion seeking to adduce fresh alibi evidence from the appellant’s parents. I allowed the adjournment, but subsequently dismissed the motion.
16        In dismissing the motion, I was mindful of the principles governing the power of the High Court to take fresh evidence on appeal. This power is conferred by s 257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(the “CPC”), which reads:
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate’s Court.
 17        Section 257 of the CPC provides that additional evidence should only be accepted if 
necessary
. In exercising this power, our courts have applied the three principles of non-availability, relevance and reliability, as encapsulated in Denning LJ’s statement in 
Ladd v Marshall
 [1954] 3 All ER 745:
In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence for a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: first it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
I found that the motion to adduce fresh evidence failed to satisfy the third condition, and as such should be dismissed.
18        There is nothing in law preventing family members and relatives from being competent witnesses for the accused. Their credibility depends on whether or not the court finds them to be entirely disinterested witnesses, or otherwise reliable: 
Liow Siow Long v PP
 
[1970] 1 MLJ 40
. In 
Thirumalai Kumar v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 434
, the appellant before me sought to rely on alibis provided by his wife and mother to prove that he was at home at the time the offences were committed. However, I found his defence, which appeared to be mounted on his own instructions, absolutely unworthy of credit. Once his testimony was rejected, the evidence of his wife and mother was of no value, as both were interested witnesses, and there was every reason to treat their evidence with caution.
19        I found the scenario in this case similar to that in 
Thirumalai Kumar
. I agreed with the trial judge that Tan’s evidence was unreliable and inconsistent, and that there was substance to the prosecution’s submission that the appellant might have bribed him. As such, the defence was unworthy of credit. The appellant’s parents were unlikely to be entirely disinterested witnesses, since they would have a strong interest in their son’s acquittal.  As such, their evidence was unreliable and of no value to this court.
20        As in 
Chung Tuck Kwai v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 693
, I further considered the additional problem of credibility should their evidence be admitted at this stage. The prosecution would not have the opportunity of cross-examining them to determine their credibility. Their evidence was of such a nature that it should not be accepted as credible without putting them to cross-examination.
21        The circumstances in which an application to adduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited. After a careful evaluation of the facts, I did not consider that this case fell within such exceptional circumstances as to justify this court taking additional evidence.
The appeal
22        Before me, the appellant contended that the trial judge erred in four main areas in coming to her findings. It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court when reviewing the decision of a trial judge. It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they can be shown to be clearly wrong, reached against the preponderance of the evidence, or unless it is shown that the trial judge has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witness. This principle has been articulated in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 at 719, 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
 and 
PP v Hla Win
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
. This is especially so when, as in the present case, a finding of fact hinges on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 at 664. Should the appellate court wish to reverse the decision of the trial judge, it must not merely entertain doubts as to whether the decision is right, but must be convinced that it is wrong: 
PP v Poh Oh Sim
 
[1990] SLR 1047
, followed in 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
. With these principles in mind, I turn to the appeal proper.
The weight attributed to Tan’s statements to the officers as opposed to his oral testimony in court
23        Although Tan identified the appellant as the person who passed the drugs to him in a white sports car and made statements to this effect to the CNB officers after arrest, he recanted this evidence at trial. Upon cross-examination, Tan explained that the statements were made after he had been assaulted by the CNB officers and was in fear of further assault. He implicated the appellant in order that the case be settled as soon as possible. Moreover, he was high on drugs at the time he made the statements, as borne out by his subsequent conviction for drug consumption over this incident. The appellant thus contended that the trial judge was unjustified in relying solely on Tan’s statements to convict him.
24        The trial judge ruled that Tan’s claims of assault and of being high on drugs at the time of his arrest were “incredible”. I found no reason to disturb this ruling.
Allegations of assault
25        I found no extraneous evidence to substantiate Tan’s claims of assault. Tan claimed that he “did not know” how to report the assault to the CNB officers. Even if I accepted this excuse for his silence, it failed to explain why he did not ask to see a doctor. If his recital of the facts was true and he was assaulted by about ten police officers who used their hands, legs and metal implements to deliver blows to his body and chest, he must have sustained substantial injuries requiring medical attention. Moreover, even if Tan failed to mention the assault to his parents so as to avoid causing them worry, they would surely have seen the bruising and wounds when they visited him. Tan also conceded that the officer who recorded his statement on the day after his arrest, SSgt Ferdhouse, did not assault him, but treated him well. Even so, Tan did not mention the assault to SSgt Ferdhouse or retract his statement. Instead, he gave a more detailed statement confirming his identification of the appellant. His explanation, that he was afraid of further assault, if he did not confirm the appellant’s involvement in handing him the drugs, rings hollow.
26        Tan also testified that, when he met the appellant at the lock-up of the Subordinate Courts, he told the appellant that he had implicated him because he was high on drugs at the time. He did not mention the assault by the officers. I agreed with the trial judge’s finding that, if the assault was a substantial reason for Tan’s false implication of the appellant, Tan would have raised it in his defence when speaking to the appellant.  Furthermore, Tan’s version of events was inconsistent with the appellant’s testimony. The appellant claimed that when he confronted Tan in the lock-up of the Clementi Police Station, Tan remained silent. The appellant was then brought to a different lock-up by the police officers. However, upon cross-examination, the appellant claimed that he saw red marks and bloodstains upon Tan’s face when they met in the lock-up of Clementi Police Station. He asked Tan about the injuries and was told that the officers, including a lady officer, had assaulted him. This was inconsistent with both their testimonies, and difficult to credit. Further, by the appellant’s account, he did not urge Tan to report the matter or ask him to see a doctor because he was “furious” with Tan for harming him. I found it only logical that the appellant would have urged Tan to report the assault and have it documented, so that he would have official substantiation for his claims that Tan implicated him under duress.
27        I also found that Tan contradicted himself during cross-examination when questioned about the number of CNB officers who had assaulted him. He initially said that “about ten of them assaulted me”, but later changed the number to “about two or three”. This only undermined the reliability of his testimony in court.
28        The trial judge further observed there was no reason for the CNB officers to assault Tan just to compel him to identify the appellant. They had already found the drugs on Tan’s person and had ample reason to arrest him. The officers who sighted the car admitted that they could not see the driver of the car clearly, even when the lights in the car were on. They also admitted that they could not identify the car’s registration number. If they were intent on finding a scapegoat for the crime, it would have been far easier for them to testify that they recognised the appellant as the driver of the white car, than for ten of them to beat up a 19-year-old boy in order to force him to implicate an innocent man and then lie about it in court. I found this reasoning to be beyond reproach.
29        For these reasons, I found that the trial judge was correct in arriving at the conclusion that Tan’s account of the assaults was fabricated.
Allegation of being high on drugs
30        I found no reason to reject the trial judge’s determination that there was no merit in Tan’s assertion that his statements to the CNB officers were vitiated by the effect of the drugs on him.
31        I accepted the evidence of ASP Lim, who has three years experience as a CNB officer, and of Sgt Lim, that Tan was alert and responsive when questioned, answering ASP Lim’s questions immediately. He did not display any symptoms of being high on drugs, such as blood-shot eyes. Instead, he gave accurate and detailed answers when questioned, stating the nature and quantity of drugs in his possession, the intended sale price of the drugs and the amount he was to be paid for delivering the drugs. I found it unlikely that his mind would have functioned with such clarity, or that he would have been so lucid, if he was really high on drugs. It also follows that, if I allowed his claim that he concocted the name of “Ah Goh” on the spot, then he was alert enough to do so through his alleged haze of drugs and fear.
32        In addition, I noted that when Tan gave his statement to SSgt Ferdhouse the day after his arrest, he was not high on drugs. By his own admission, he gave it voluntarily. If he had been “high” the previous day, it is curious that he should remember the contents and details of the statement he gave to ASP Lim with such clarity, including the elements he had supposedly concocted on the spot, so as to replicate it for SSgt Ferdhouse and embellish it with further details. Moreover, he was able to remember the face of a supposed stranger, the appellant, and identify the appellant’s photograph before SSgt Ferdhouse.
33        Accordingly, I was satisfied that the trial judge was correct in rejecting Tan’s claim that he implicated the appellant because he was high on drugs as “incredible”.
Whether the trial judge erred in accepting Tan’s statements over his oral testimony, and giving undue weight to the retracted statements of an impeached witness
34        The appellant contended that the trial judge should not have accepted Tan’s statements to the CNB officers over his oral testimony in court. This court noted in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 that, in addition to their use for impeachment of the witness’ credit, previous inconsistent statements made by a witness to a police officer in the course of a police investigation are also admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein. As such, when Tan failed to give a satisfactory explanation for the inconsistencies in his statements, the trial judge was entitled to impeach his credit and admit Tan’s statements to the CNB officers as substantive evidence.
35        As for the appellant’s argument that the trial judge attached undue weight to Tan’s statements to the CNB officers, I was not convinced that this claim was of any merit. The trial judge correctly followed the decision in 
Sng Siew Ngoh
, which held that there is no requirement for corroboration of a previous inconsistent statement. Conviction can be determined on the evidence of previous inconsistent statements, provided that the court, in assessing the weight to be accorded to the inconsistent statements, has regard to the factors listed in s 147(6) of the Evidence Act, namely:
… all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question of whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
36        Further guidance on the application of this provision has been given in 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd & Another
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
, as affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
, 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
 and 
Thiruselvam s/o Nagaratnam v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 125
. First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important, since it guards against inaccuracy. Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement, but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts. Regard should also be had to the context of the statement, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon should be noted.
Contemporaneity
37        The first statement was taken almost immediately after Tan’s arrest. Tan was arrested at 10.25pm. The statement was taken at 11.00pm, and later at 11.50pm, while the facts were still fresh in Tan’s mind. Tan had the opportunity of seeing the appellant twice – first, in the car park of Block 36 from a distance of about eight metres and again, when the appellant was brought up to the 11
th
 floor for identification, from a distance of about two metres. Similarly, identification of the appellant’s car was made when Tan was in the police van and again, when Tan was on the eighth floor. The second statement was taken just a day after the arrest. In both statements, Tan was consistent in implicating the appellant as the supplier of the drugs. The trial judge found this consistency to be a strong indication that the statements were closer to the truth than Tan’s oral testimony, which was given after the passing of a period of time, during which he came into contact with the appellant. I had no difficulty in accepting this to be the case.
Incentive to conceal or misrepresent facts
38        The prosecution postulated, and the trial judge accepted, that the appellant must have offered Tan some monetary inducement to exonerate him in court. Tan testified that he only spoke with the appellant at the lock-up of the Subordinate Courts on 15 January 2003. The appellant, on the other hand, said that after their arrest, he spoke to Tan on four occasions. These contradictions in their testimonies were telling. From the circumstances, I agreed with the trial judge that there was sufficient reason to believe that the appellant was trying to give the impression of a wronged man who had spoken repeatedly to Tan in an effort to clear his name, whilst Tan was taking pains to give the impression that he had had minimum contact with the appellant, and that his retraction was purely voluntary.
Explanation of the inconsistency
39        As I accepted that Tan’s allegations of assault and being high on drugs rang hollow, I found that he had no incentive to misrepresent facts in his statements to the CNB officers. As such, the accuracy of his statements was not diluted. On the contrary, such an incentive did exist by the time he appeared in court to give testimony, which affected the weight to be attached to his testimony.
Context, cogency and coherency of the statements
40        I noted that, apart from Tan’s insistence that he had wrongly identified the appellant as the supplier of drugs, all the other details in his oral testimony were largely consistent with those in the statements he gave to the CNB officers. His statements to the CNB officers were clear and to the point. The officers testified that he was active and alert when he gave the statements. This militated in favour of placing more weight on these statements.
Weight to be accorded to Tan’s statements
41        Section 135(2) of the Evidence Act provides that the court can convict an accused person on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. Nevertheless, the trial judge treated Tan’s evidence with caution. She scrutinised the contents of Tan’s prior statements, testing the alleged facts against the evidence of the CNB officers, before concluding that they were accurate. She applied the s 147(6) factors when assessing the amount of weight to attribute to the prior statements. As such, I found no reason to overturn her decision to give more weight to Tan’s statements to the CNB officers than to his oral testimony and to use them as a basis for the appellant’s conviction.
Whether identification of the vehicle and its driver was tainted
42        The appellant canvassed the argument that the trial judge failed to adequately consider that none of the CNB officers could identify the vehicle or its driver, relying instead on Tan’s tainted identification. I was not convinced by this argument. The trial judge did recognise that none of the CNB officers could identify the appellant as the driver of the white sports car that dropped Tan, and that they could not identify the car. I also doubted that Tan’s identification of the car or its driver was tainted. The appellant premised this argument on the already discredited basis that Tan made the identification when he was high on drugs and in fear of further assault by the officers. Upon cross-examination, Tan admitted that he had “no difficulty” in recognising the appellant and that, even when he was “high” on drugs, he was still aware of who the driver of the car was.
43        Furthermore, I accepted the collective evidence of the CNB officers that they saw Tan alighting from a white car at Block 40. This car had a bluish light inside it. A white car was later seen in the car park of Block 36. This is consistent with the appellant’s own evidence that he drove from Block 40 to Block 36. It is also consistent with what Tan told SSgt Fong – that he had been dropped at Block 40 and that the supplier was waiting for him at the car park of Block 36. When the officers rushed there, the appellant’s car was the only white car in the car park with a hot engine. Moreover, it had a blue internal light.
44        I found that Tan’s identification of the appellant was far from tainted, since he had the chance to identify him more than once, when they were in close proximity. Given that the appellant did not deny ownership of the car, I found that Tan’s identification of the appellant alone was sufficient to link him to the case.
Whether an adverse inference should have been drawn against the appellant for his failure to provide an alibi witness
45        The appellant further criticised the trial judge for drawing an adverse inference against him for his failure to provide his mother as an alibi witness after seeking leave of the court to call her.
46        The general rule is that no adverse inference can be drawn against the defence if it chooses not to call any witnesses, as was held in 
Goh Ah Yew v PP
 
[1949] 1 MLJ 150
, followed in 
Abu Bakar v R
 
[1963] 1 MLJ 288
. Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act supplies an important qualification to this rule: the court is entitled to presume that “evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who holds it”. This was elaborated upon in 
PP v Nurashikin bte Ahmad Borhan
 
[2003] 1 SLR 52
 at para 24:
… if the prosecution has made out a complete case against the defendant, and yet the defence has failed to call a material witness when calling such a witness is the only way to rebut the prosecution’s case, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act then allows the court to draw an adverse inference against the defendant: 
Choo Chang Teik v PP
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 423
, 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 789
. This is based on the commonsense notion that if the only way for the defence to rebut the prosecution’s case is to call a particular witness, then her failure to do so naturally raises the inference that even that witness’s evidence will be unfavourable to her.
47        The appellant sought leave of the court to call his mother as witness in order that he might establish that he left his home in Bukit Batok at 10.00pm or 10.05pm. If so, it would have been physically impossible for him to be in Chai Chee, pick Tan up, pass him the drugs, and drop him at Block 40 by 10.25pm, the time of Tan’s arrest. The appellant’s mother was not in court when called on 14 February 2003. Court was adjourned and the defence was given ample time to search for her, but she was still not present when court resumed on 12 March 2003.
48        Relying on 
Nurashikin
, the trial judge drew an “irresistible inference” that, had the appellant’s mother been called, her evidence would have been disadvantageous to him. I found that the trial judge was fully entitled to do so. It was established at the trial below that the appellant had driven Tan in a white car and had given him drugs to traffic. The CNB officers saw Tan alighting from a white car with a bluish light in it at Block 36 at about 10.15pm. The appellant himself admitted that he was driving a white car with a bluish light in it, and that he drove to Block 36, albeit at 10.25pm, before going to Block 40. As such, a complete case was made out against the appellant, and the only way he could rebut the evidence stacked against him was to call his mother to the stand. The trial judge was therefore correct in drawing an adverse inference against him for his failure to produce his mother in court.
49        In any event, I considered that even if the adverse inference had not been drawn, this would have had little or no effect upon the determination of the case. Given the other evidence upon which the trial judge based her decision, coupled with the finding that the appellant’s defence was absolutely unworthy of credit, it was highly unlikely that the mother’s evidence, if given, would have carried enough weight so as to reverse the verdict in the court below.
Conclusion
50        In essence, the appellant premised his appeal on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt. I found this appeal, and the arguments canvassed in its support, absolutely untenable for the foregoing reasons. As such, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. He commenced practice as a sole proprietor under the name of Philip Wong & Co on 1 May 1969. His practice was mainly in the area of conveyancing. On 20 March 1989, he was struck off the rolls of advoca tes and solicitors by the Supreme Court on a disciplinary charge which was unrelated to the offences in respect of which the present appeal against sentence has been brought.
On 21 March 1989, the Council of the Law Society of Singapore passed a resolution vesting in the Law Society all moneys held in the clients` account in the name of the appellant` s firm and took control of it on 22 March 1989. The bank statement as at 31 March 1989 showed that the firm had a credit balance of $5,903.60 in the clients` account.
On 11 April 1989, the appellant surrendered himself to the Commercial Affairs Department and he was formally arrested on the following day. On 14 April 1989, he was adjudged a bankrupt by the High Court.
On 24 April 1989, the appellant was charged with six charges of criminal breach of trust in his capacity as an agent of clients` moneys held in the clients` account of the firm. In the event, the prosecution proceeded with only two charges, to which the appellant pleaded guilty, on the agreement that the remaining four charges were to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. The material facts of the six charges may be tabulated thus: 
 
Case no Amount No of Period
involved clients
 
 
 
DAC 4241 $143,220.15 7 10.01.89 - 09.03.89
DAC 4242 $683,039.40 9 25.01.88 - 31.12.88 
DAC 4243 $650,419.50 1 13.05.88 - 28.12.88 
DAC 4244 $163,961.29 6 20.04.87 - 29.12.87 
DAC 4245 $128,879.21 3 14.03.86 - 15.11.86 
DAC 4246 $ 71,712.81 4 01.01.85 - 15.06.85
 
 
 
Total $1,841,232.20 30
 
 
 
The statement to facts which the appellant accepted for the purpose of pleading guilty to the two charges under DAC 4241 and DAC 424 2 also disclosed that the bulk of the money misappropriated from the clients` account consisted of moneys paid by clients for completion of property transactions, payment of stamp fees and also one large sum held as stakeholder. There is no disclosure on w hat the appellant had done with the moneys dishonestly misappropriated by him over the years.
The appellant was represented by counsel in the plea of guilty. Counsel put forward the following factors in mitigation:
 
 
(1) he surrendered himself and co-operated with the police, resulting in the expedited completion of investigation; 
 
(2) he pleaded guilty and therefore demonstrated his remorse; 
 
(3) he was a bankrupt and struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors; 
 
(4) he was a man of good character and contributed to community service in the following respects: 
 
(a) as a member of the Dunearn Secondary School Advisory Board from 1969- 1989; 
 
(b) as a tutor in the Postgraduate Law Course from 1980- 1988; 
 
(c) as the President of the Singapore Ten Pin Bowling Congress from 1985- 1989/March, during which he helped to raise $430,000; 
 
(d) as a blood donor for 18 times from 1980- 1989.
  
 
 
The senior district judge sentenced the appellant to serve, consecutively, a term of three years` imprisonment on each of the two charges. In his grounds of decision, the judge reminded himself that the maximum sentence he could impose for the two offences was seven years` imprisonment for each offence, so that the three years he actually imposed was a little short of one-half of the maximum sentence within his own jurisdiction. He accepted all the mitigation factors I have mentioned above save that the appellant` s record of community service was not expressly adverted to in his grounds of decision.
The judge was of the view that in spite of what he regarded as strong mitigation factors, he could not overlook the following facts: (i) t he appellant misappropriated moneys he was holding as an advocate and solicitor, a position of trust in society; (ii) the regularity of the misappropriations over the period from 1985 to 1989; (iii) the total amount involved (which was more than $1.8m); (i v) the absence of any restitution.
The appellant was dissatisfied with the sentence and has now appealed against it. Before me, his counsel has advanced a number of grounds of appeal which I shall consider under the following heads:
 Strength of mitigation factors 
The submission under this head was that the judge had failed to give due weight to the mitigation factors generally and in particular to the appellant` s previous good character. In his grounds of decision, the judge stated that the appellant ` has convincingly demonstrated his remorse for his criminal acts` (by his co-operation) and in respect of which the judge considered as of ` paramount importance` . He also said it was to the appellant` s ` credit` that he co-operated with the CAD and that ` Just as admirable a factor to be considered in his favour is the fact that he had voluntarily surrendered himself to the CAD` . This is rather fulsome language to describe the mitigation quality of the surrender and the plea of guilty. These statements plainly show that there is no substance in counsel` s submission on this point.
However, having given careful consideration to the entire background in which the offences were committed and, in particular to the conduct of th e appellant during the period when he was misappropriating his clients` moneys, I am of the view that the judge has given undue weight to these two factors.
On the statement of facts, the appellant misappropriated during 1988 a total sum of about $1.33m and in the three months of 1989 he misappropriated about $143,000. These sums were misappropriated during a period when (i) a judgment for $235,000 had b een obtained against him in respect of which (ii) a petition had to be filed by the judgment credit or to make him a bankrupt and (iii) which he was so made on 14 April 1989 and (iv) when he had been ordered to show cause in disciplinary proceedings against him. The appellant did not appear to have been remorseful during this period. In fact, he conteste d the claim against him for the refund of $235,000 (which represented the 10% deposit for the purchase of a property from the appellant` s client) on the ground that his client had forfeited the said deposit when the truth was that he had dishonestly misappropriated this sum between 29 March 1988 to 31 August 1988 as admitted in the statement of facts.
Although the appellant surrendered himself to the CAD, it is significant to note that this event occurred at a time when he really had no other choice. He had no choice because the Council of the Law Society had taken over the clients` account of his firm and it was only a question of time before his misdeeds came to light. This is in stark contrast to the defence he put forward in respect of the claim fo r $235,000 at a time when his misdeeds remained secret and safe with him. Similarly, the plea of guilty was not made in a case where the prosecution might have any trouble in proving the charges.
In making these comments, I do not dissent from the principle applied by the senior district judge that the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may b e evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means o f escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.
With regard to the submission that the previous good character of the appellant, with particular reference to his commu nity service, had not been taken into account, it is, of course, not possible to say whether the senior district judge would have imposed the same sentences and in the same way if he had expressly taken them into account. I used the word ` expressly ` advisedly as it was unlikely that he could have overlooked them as he passed sentence on the day following the plea of guilty and counsel` s submission was made in writing. Be that as it may, for reasons which I shall give later, I do not think that the community service rendered by the appellant would have made a material difference to the sentences in this case, having regard to all the circumstances.
Counsel has also drawn the attention of the court to the fact that the appellant is now 50 years old and is ` out of circulation` and is a bankrupt. He submitted that imprisonment would deprive the appellant of the means of discharging his debts and that a long term of imprisonment would not protect the public interest. I do not agree with this submission. The appellant` s bankruptcy would make it difficult for him to repay his creditors, and his loss of his professional status would deprive him of the opportunity to do so. As for the point on public interest, I shall consider this later in relation to the princi ple of deterrence.
I should finally mention that the circumstances of this case are such that the appellant is, unfortunately, not even in a position to rely on as a mitigation factor what, in a normal case, would be the consequence of a conviction f or an offence involving dishonesty, viz the loss of professional status. Here, the loss of that status did not flow from his conviction but from an unrelated disciplinary offence.
 Proportionality 
I agree with counsel for the appellant on his submission on the principle of proportionality in sentencing. In an offence like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amoun t dishonestly misappropriated the greater th e culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court. However, the senior district judge is not lacking in knowledge or experience in the sentencing of offenders and accordingly, I do not believe that he has overlooked this obvious p oint when he decided to impose a term of three years` imprisonment for each offence involving substantially different sums of money.
In any case, I do not think that this point matters in this case. The division of the charges into six periods of tim e were a matter of convenience. The prosecution could have framed any number of charges from one to 30 or more. This is a matter of form rather than of substance. The important question is whether the totality of the consecutive sentences was manifestly ex cessive, and to this issue I now turn.
 Totality of consecutive sentences 
It is an established principle of sentencing that where consecutive sentences are passed against an offender, the sentencer must take into account the totality of the cumulative sentences to determine whether it is justified by the criminal behaviour of the offender in the case as a whole. As analysed by DA Thomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing (2nd Ed) at p 57, the totality principle has two limbs: 
 
 
A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved or if its effect is to impose on the offender ` a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his record or prospects.
 
 
 
The issue in this appeal is therefore whether the cumulative six years` imprisonment infringes either of these two considerations.
Before I answer that question, there is another argument of counsel for the appellant that I should first dispose of. It is that the senior district judge, in exercising his discretion to order the sentences to run consecutively, did not act judicial ly on the ground that he gave no reason for so acting. It is true that the judge did not explicitly say why he considered the consecutive sentences to be appropriate in this case, but he did say that the offences merited a ` sterner punishment ` which would have been ` sterner` but for the mitigating factors. One of the considerations that he expressly took into account was the fact that the total amount misappropriated by the appellant was a ` colossal $1.4m, or thereabouts, siphoned from his firm` s clients` account over a period from 1985 to 1989` . In my view, it is sufficiently clear that from these references that what was uppermost in the mind of the senior district judge was the totality of the criminal acts of the appellant when he made the sentences consecutive. The judge was not looking merely at the two charges of criminal breach of trust but at all the criminal acts and the total amount involved.
 Was six years` imprisonment manifestly excessive? 
The important consideration under this head is the nature of the offence, as on it depends its gravity. It is criminal breach of trust. The gravity of this type of offence is recognized by the legislature in s 409 of the Penal Code. When committed by an agent, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for life, or up to ten years, and a lso liability to a fine. The rationale for viewing criminal breach of trust as a serious offence is explained in Andrew Ashworth` s book, 
 Sentencing and Penal Policy (1983) at p 194 in these words: 
 
 
Where an offence involves a breach of trust, this is generally treated as an aggravating factor. Its powerful influence is shown by the degree to which it outweighs factors which would normally go in mitigation. Indeed, there is the paradox that some of the strongest factors in mitigation (unblemish ed career, model citizen, good employment record) are often present in these cases and yet do not tell greatly in the offender` s favour. The reason is that positions of trust are not normally given to individuals unless they have unblemished references, an d so the offence may be seen as a betrayal of those very basis of trust, and one of the burdens of a position of trust is an undertaking of incorruptibility. The individual who puts himself forward as trustworthy, is trusted by others and then takes advant age of his power for his own personal ends can be said to offend in two ways - not only does he commit the crime charged (be it theft, false accounting or a sexual offence), but in addition he breaches the trust placed in him by society and by the victims of the particular offence.
 
 
 
Although the appellant was tried on the two charges in the district court which, in consequence, limited the maximum sentence the district judge could impose to seven years each, it does not follow that the maximum sentence for that offence is seven years in terms of its gravity. The decision of the public prosecutor to bring criminal proceedings in the district court cannot affect the gravity of the offence as reflected in s 402 of the Penal Code. It may, at most, reflect his judgment on the appellant` s culpability in relation to the offences. It is no more than a factor that the court may take into account.
There may be other aggravating factors. The deliberate and systematic embezzlement of clients` money by an advocate and solicitor is such a factor. In 
 R 
 v 
 Barrick (1985) 81 Cr App R 78 at pp 81- 82, Lord Lane CJ, after stating that the sum involved was not the only factor to be considered, said: 
 
The following are some of the matters to which the court will no doubt wish to pay regard in determining what the proper level of sentence should be: (i) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender including his rank; (ii) the period over which the fraud or the thefts have been perpetrated; (iii) the use to which the money or property dishonestly taken was put; (iv) the effect upon the victim; (v) the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence; (vi) the effect on fellow-employees or partners; (vii) the effect on the offender himself; (viii) his own history; (ix) those matters of mitigation special to himself such as illness; being placed under great strain by excessive responsibility or the like; where, as sometimes happens, there has been a long delay, say over two years, bet ween his being confronted with his dishonesty by his professional body or the police and the start of his trial; finally, any help given by him to the police.
 
 
 
Applying the above guidelines to the present cases, what we have here is a case w here (1) the amount dishonestly misappropriated was a large sum, (2) by a person who because of his status the public has entrusted to him the safety of their moneys in relation to their property transactions, (3) over a long period of time, (4) whose effe ct on some of the 30 victims could be traumatic or financially disastrous, bearing in mind that the purchase of a house is generally the most expensive transaction an ordinary person is likely to enter into in his lifetime, (5) which embezzlements have a s erious impact on public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession, (6) the only person who has benefitted from the criminal acts was the appellant himself, and finally (7) he has not made any restitution at all to any of the victims.
Thus, whilst there are many aggravating factors in this case, there are only a few plausible and also relatively weak mitigating factors. I have commented on two of these earlier. The third factor, viz community service, is the only mitigating factor that can be said to be in his favour but that is a weak factor in an offence of this type for the reasons I have given. I do not think that it has such a material effect on the totality of the sentence that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
Counsel has also submitted that the senior district judge was wrong in giving undue weight to the status of the appellant as a solicitor. He said this was wrong. In support of this argument, he referred to a case (MA No 15/81) reported in 
 The Straits Times concerning a solicitor who had drawn out a sum of about $11,000 from his firm` s clients` account to settle a personal debt. He surrendered himself and was charged with criminal breach of trust to which he pleaded guilty. It was an isolated act. In fact, the cheque was dr awn out from the general credit in anticipation, by a few days, of a sum of money due to be collected for a client who had given him consent to draw the same out. Thus, if he had waited a few days, he would not have committed the offence. He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment. The Chief Justice, in reducing the sentence to one day` s imprisonment and a fine of $5,000, was reported to have said: ` In a CBT case, it could be wrong for a sentencing court to be more severe on the offender merely because he is a professional` . 
Counsel relies on this statement. In my view, this statement does not assist the appellant in this appeal. The Chief Justice said it 
 could be wrong and not that it 
 was wrong. In the case before him, the Chief Justice found that i t was wrong to give undue weight to the status of the wrongdoer because the circumstances in which the offence was committed were exceptionally unusual and provided exceptionally strong mitigating factors. The Chief Justice did not intend to mean and could not have meant that in every case of criminal breach of trust, a solicitor who commits such an offence should receive the same sentence as a lowly clerk who commits that kind of offence. The circumstances of this case are very much different. 
Lawyers trade on their honesty. They sell their trustworthiness. Accordingly, one of the gravest offences an advocate and solicitor can commit is to take his clients` money. Criminal breach of trust by a lawyer in the discharge of his professional duty must inev itably call for a custodial sentence of a deterrent nature, not so much as to deter the offender concerned but to deter other members of his profession from committing similar offences.
I will now refer to two other cases of criminal breach of trust committed by lawyers. In MA No 21 of 1975, the Chief Justice dismissed an appeal against a six-year sentence on a solicitor who had pleaded guilty to seven charges of criminal breach of trust of clients` money from 1972 to 1973. The total amount involved w as slightly in excess of $200,000. The senior district judge had imposed a term of imprisonment of three years for each offence, the first two sentences to run consecutively, and the other five sentences to run concurrently with the first two sentences.
In 1979, another solicitor also pleaded guilty to four charges of criminal breach of trust (see DAC Nos 415/79, 417/79, 592/79 and 595/79). The total amount involved was about $1,480,000, of which restitution in the amount of about $543,590 had been ma de and a further sum of about $100,000 was available from the sale of his house. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of four years on each of the first two charges and three years` imprisonment on the remaining two charges. The judge made one of th e three-year sentences consecutive with one of the four-year sentences, and the rest to run concurrently, with the result that the total custodial sentence imposed was seven years. The solicitor concerned did not appeal and this was consistent with the sol icitor` s statement in his plea of mitigation that he was prepared for any punishment that the court might pass upon him. His conduct demonstrated his genuine remorse for his wrongdoings.
For the reasons I have given, the consecutive sentences amounting to six years` imprisonment passed on the appellant are not excessive in the present case. The appeal is dismissed.

The facts
 
1          Whilst cycling on a footpath at the Pasir Ris Park on a Sunday afternoon, the plaintiff, a five year old boy, was injured in a collision with a lorry travelling on the same footpath.  The occupier of the park, the 1
st
 defendant, had engaged the 2
nd
 defendant to clean the park.  The 2
nd
 defendant had subcontracted the cleaning works to the 3
rd
 defendant.  The lorry was driven by the 3
rd
 defendant’s servant and or agent.
2          The plaintiff claim was that the three defendants were jointly and severally liable for the accident: as against the 1
st
 defendant, for occupier’s liability and or negligence, against the 3
rd
 defendant, for vicarious liability for the negligence of his servant or agent, and against the 2
nd
 defendant, for vicarious liability for the acts of the 3
rd
 defendant whom the 2
nd
 defendant allegedly controlled and supervised.
Pleadings
Claim against the 1
st
 defendant
3          The 1
st
 defendant is a body corporate established under the National Parks Act Cap 198 A whose functions include managing controlling and administration of the National Parks and nature reserves of Singapore.
4          The plaintiff alleged the 1
st
 defendant had a duty of care to all lawful visitors to the park to ensure that the park was safe to use and that it did not introduce or allow to be introduced potentially dangerous or unsafe contraption or practices to the park.
5          It was in breach of this duty and or negligently that the 1
st
 defendant caused, allowed and or permitted the accident.  The particulars alleged were:
(1) Permitting or allowing the 2
nd
 defendant to operate on the park on a Sunday without taking into consideration the expected increase in the policy number of users, especially young children;
(2) Permitting or allowing the 2
nd
 defendant to operate without ensuring that a proper and safe or adequate system of clearing rubbish was implemented;
(3) Permitting or allowing the 2
nd
 defendant to introduce the lorry, instead of a safer and smaller contraption into the park when the designated tracks were only meant for cyclist and pedestrians/ joggers;
(4) Permitting or allowing the 2
nd
 defendant to introduce the lorry without any safety barrier, hoarding or warning signs;
(5) Failing to put up advance warning to visitors that a lorry would be introduced onto the designated tracks of the park on that day at that time;
(6) Failing to take any or any reasonable care to ensure the plaintiff, a young child would be reasonably safe in using the park;
(7) Failing to take any or any reasonable care to prevent injury to the plaintiff from the introduction of a lorry into the park which it knew or ought to have known to be potentially dangerous;
(8) In the circumstances exposing the plaintiff to risk of collision which it knew or ought to have known.
Claim against the 2
nd
 defendant
6          The claim against the 2
nd
 defendant was that as the 3
rd
 defendant was under the supervision and control of the 2
nd
 defendant, the 2
nd
 defendant was vicariously liable for the acts of the 3
rd
 defendant.  The 2
nd
 defendant had failed to ensure that the 3
rd
 defendant complied with all safety requirements of the 1
st
 defendant.
Claim against the 3
rd
 Defendant
7          The particulars alleged against the 3
rd
 defendant were:
(1) Failing to stop and allow the plaintiff to pass safely;
(2) Failing to give way to the plaintiff;
(3) Failing to keep proper look out or have sufficient regard for cyclist and children that were or expected to be at the Pasir Ris Park;
(4) Failing to have any control or proper control of the lorry;
(5) Travelling at an excessive speed than permitted at the Pasir Ris Park;
(6) Failing to stop, slow down, swerve so as to avoid the collision;
(7) Failing to put up any or adequate safety barrier whilst operating at Pasir Ris Park;
(8) Failing to put up any or adequate hoarding or warning signs along the path of the lorry at Pasir Ris Park;
(9) Failing to comply with the safety requirement of the 1
st
 defendant in particular failing to install a rotating light on the lorry.
8       Obviously, the particulars referred to negligence on the part of the driver.  In his amendment to allege that one Ang Cheng Hock drove the lorry as servant and or agent of the 3
rd
 defendant, the plaintiff omitted to reflect this in the particulars of negligence.  As the 3
rd
 defendant was not in court, I did not think it appropriate to consider an amendment to put this right.  However, it was clear that no one was for a moment misled by this error; the affidavits filed for the 3
rd
 defendant attest to this.
Defence of the 1
st
 defendant
9          The 1
st
 defendant denied breach of its duties as occupier and negligence.  Its pleaded that the main footpath was also a service track intended for use of service vehicles, and that it had exercised all reasonable care in engaging an independent contractor and was not liable for acts of the independent contractor.  The 1
st
 defendant also alleged negligence on the part of the infant plaintiff, the 2
nd
 defendant and or the 3
rd
 defendant.
10        In closing, the 1
st
 defendant argued that the accident not caused by the physical condition of the land, but by current operations at the site which, it argued were not unusually dangerous.  It also argued that a lorry on a footpath in the park was not a danger unusual to the infant plaintiff.
Defence of the 2
nd
 defendant
11        The 2
nd
 defendant’s defence was that the 2
nd
 defendant had engaged the 3
rd
 defendant as independent contractor.  At no time was the 3
rd
 defendant under the supervision or control of the 2
nd
 defendant.
Defence of the 3
rd
 defendant
12        The 3
rd
 defendant alleged contributory negligence on the part of the infant plaintiff as well as the plaintiff’s mother against whom the 3
rd
 defendant subsequently took out third party proceedings which were ultimately abandoned.   The 3
rd
 defendant denied it was servant, agent or contractor of 2
nd
 defendant.
13        The 3
rd
 defendant did not appear at the trial.  The 3
rd
 defendant solicitors discharged themselves after the first day of trial as they were unable to reach the 3
rd
 defendant.  I was given to understand that the 3
rd
 defendant insurers were not defending the action despite the personal injuries as they denied liability on the ground that the accident took place in a park and not a public road.
Reply
14        The plaintiff denied negligence on the part of the third party.
Evidence
15        The evidence, insofar as it is relevant for the purposes of the appeal is set out below.
L
16       L, the father of the plaintiff, testified that on the Sunday 5 December 1999, he and his wife brought their two children to the park at about 1pm.  His wife hired two bicycles for the two children.  His son had been riding the four wheel bicycle unassisted since 1998.  His wife would keep an eye on the children riding their bicycles in the vicinity.  They had been to the park many times and they thought the park was safe for children to roam freely as there were no vehicles allowed in the park. He attended to outdoor photography at the park.
17      He felt that the 1
st
 defendant was to blame for the accident.  After all, it had control and directed the modus operandi of the cleaning contractor:  He agreed that it was reasonable for the 1
st
 defendant to place the refuse in bags and remove the bags from the park.  He disagreed however that it was reasonable for the 1
st
 defendant to allow vehicles into the park;  The ambulance had not entered the park but had waited at the carpark. He said that the footpath was narrow and a vehicle entering it would find it hard to manoeuvre. According to him, the ambulance did not enter the park as the road was too narrow.  The width of the footpath could be seen from Exb P1 and PA1, pg 16.
18        The plaintiff’s father testified that the height of the lorry (Exbs P1 and PA1, pg 17) hindered the driver’s view of the children cycling.
19        He pointed out that after the accident, the 1
st
 defendant switched to using tricycles at the East Coast (Exb PA1, pg 50) to clear rubbish.
20        L said that his son was able to ride a four-wheel bicycle and had been doing so in the year before the accident.  He agreed that his son was not able to ride a two-wheel bicycle but at the time of the accident, the son was not riding a two-wheel, but a four-wheel, (Exb P2) which he was able to ride.
21        L pointed out that it was not possible for the parents to run after the bicycle when the child rides the bicycle.
Y
22        Y testified that he had been riding the bicycle (Exb P2) for a year before the accident. On the day in question, his mother was trying to follow him but he was cycling fast and his mother could not keep up with him.
23        The accident occurred at the junction (Exb PA1 pg 16).  Y marked on a sketch plan (Exb P5 pg 1) his position ‘XB’ and that of the lorry ‘XL when he first saw the lorry
.
 He was not very clear as to the point of contact with the lorry.  At one point, he said it was the front of the lorry at the left side of the mudguard which hit him.  Elsewhere, he said it was the left corner or the left side of the lorry near the corner which hit him.  Upon impact, the lorry stopped.
24        When he saw the lorry, he was very frightened.  When he knew that the lorry and he would meet at the junction, he applied his brakes.  He marked his position when he applied his brakes at point ‘Y’ on the sketch plan (Exb P5, pg 1).  At that point, he was very close to the lorry and it was too late.  He was cycling fast before applying his brakes.  There was no slope from the XB to the point of impact.  It was level ground.  When he was questioned by the police, he had said that he did not brake.
George Tay
25        Mr Tay, the principal park manager since 1 November 1998, gave evidence for the 1
st
 defendant.  The 1
st
 defendant had engaged the 2
nd
 defendant to clean the park under a three year contract.  He agreed that there was no professional expertise required in the cleansing operations; the 1
st
 defendant could have executed them on its own
.
26
       
 Mr Tay’s evidence at one point suggested that very often, rangers imposed fines on adult cyclists on the footpath and warned little child cyclists off the footpath. Elsewhere, he said that it was to a limited extent that park users did not adhere the footpath and the bicycle path.  His rangers would warn child cyclists off the footpath.  The accident occurred at Park Area 3, which was 15 hectares in size.  On the day of the accident, the park rangers were in Park Area 3 for half an hour from 5pm to 5 30pm.  I gathered from his evidence that at the time of the accident at 3pm, there were no park rangers in Park Area 3.
27        Under the cleansing contract, the 1
st
 defendant specified the system of refuse disposal.  The system adopted by the 1
st
 defendant was that refuse would be collected and placed in bags alongside the service track, which was also the footpath, and a lorry would enter the park and travel on the footpath to collect the bags.  After the accident, the 1
st
 defendant changed the system of work:  The refuse bags were brought from the park to the carpark where the lorry waited; At the East Coast Park, the refuse was brought by tricycles and later, by pushcarts to the carpark where the lorry waited.  At the Pasir Ris Park the workers pushed the bags to the carpark where the lorry waited.
28        In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Tay stated that under the system in place at the time of the accident, a lorry or pickup would enter the park to collect the bags. Cross-examined, Mr Tay agreed that the type of vehicle used had to be approved by the 1
st
 defendant and that it had been a specific requirement on the part of the 1
st
 defendant that lorries be used.
29        The 1
st
 defendant regulated the hours the lorry could enter the park.  It specified the number of times the park to be cleaned, and the time by which each cleaning had to be finished.  As the park was especially crowded on weekends, a lot of refuse was generated and it was necessary to clean the park twice a day. On average, 1.5 tonnes of refuse was collected from the 70 hectare park on weekends.  Park Area 3 was 15 hectares in size.  According to Mr Tay, it took the lorry one to two hours to clean the park. At the time of the accident, it was to be cleaned twice on Sundays with the first cleaning completed by 10 am and the second at 4 pm. According to Mr Tay, these were convenient times as it was still well lit and not so crowded. The park usually became more crowded in the evenings when it was not so hot. After the accident, the 1st defendant revised the cleaning hours to commence at 6 am to 8 am at the Pasir Ris and 5.30 am to 8 am at the East Coast.
30        In regulating the hours of entry to the park, the 1
st
 defendant’s rules prohibited the lorry from entering the park before 9 30 am and after 4 30pm at the time of the accident. These were what the 1
st
 defendant called ‘peak hours’.  In drawing up the peak hours, the 1
st
 defendant made no distinction between the peak hours on week days and peak hours on weekends; The peak hours on Sundays were the same as those on weekdays.
31        In practice, however, according to Mr Tay, the 1
st
 defendant allowed the lorries entry into the park during the prohibited peak hours as well.  This was borne out in its letter of 3 June 2000 to the Bedok Police Division, (Exb PA1, pg 47), where the 1
st
 defendant stated that:
‘There is a certain time frame of 
non-peak hours
 which vehicles have to adhere to when entering the park (please refer to the attached guidelines). This applied to all vehicles 
except our cleansing contractors
. This is because the contractor is required to carry out his cleansing work everyday, especially on weekends and public holidays, when there is heavy park usage.  (emphasis is mine)’.
32            Incidentally, the stipulated hours of entry did not give the lorry sufficient  time to complete the cleaning in the mornings; The 1
st
 defendant  allowed the lorry to enter at 9.30 am.  However, it required the park to be cleaned by 10 am. A lorry required one to two hours to clean the park.  The contractor was liable to be fined if it failed to complete the cleaning by the stipulated time. Cross-examined on whether this would cause the lorry to rush through its cleaning, Mr Tay said that depended on how they organised their work.          
33        After the accident, the 1
st
 defendant started to enforce the rule prohibiting the entry of cleansing vehicles during the peak hours.
34        After the accident, the 1
st
 defendant also revised the prohibited hours of entry.  Prior to the accident, the lorry was prohibited entry during the peak hours before 9.30 am and after 4.30 pm on weekdays and weekends alike.  From May 2001, the lorry was prohibited entry throughout the day on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.
35        Mr Tay also testified that at the time of the accident, the 1
st
 defendant imposed a speed limit of 15 km/h on the lorry and required rotating lights installed atop the lorry.  He agreed that installing on the lorry a speed warning for exceeding the speed limit would warn park users, the driver and the 1
st
 defendant of any violation of the speed limit.  This was not a requirement of the 1st defendant.
36        Park rangers patrolled the park to enforce such regulations as to speed and the rotating light.  In the event of non-compliance, a ranger could stop the vehicle and issue a warning or report the contractor to the 1
st
 defendant which would take action.
37        The lorry involved in the collision did not have a rotating light. Mr Tay said that his rangers had overlooked the fact. The lorry had been in use for a one year but there was no evidence as to how long it had been without a rotating light. The 1
st
 defendant came to know of this after the accident  at a meeting with the 2
nd
 defendant. After the accident, a security guard at the carpark entrance where lorries entered would take down particulars and furnish guidelines to the lorry drivers.
38        Mr Tay learned of the accident six days after the accident from the newspapers.  There was no report of the accident from the rangers.  On the day in question, the 5 rangers at Park Area 3 from 5 pm to 5.30 pm were on an anti littering exercise.  Mr Tay disagreed the 1
st
 defendant placed more importance on cleanliness than on safety.  The 2
nd
 defendant was required under the contract to report the accident to the 1
st
 defendant, the police and the insurance within 24 hours of the accident. This not done in this case. The 2
nd
 defendant was required to report daily to the 1
st
 defendant’s administrative office at Gateway Beach Rd, but sometimes it did not come.
39        The 1
st
 defendant imposed on the 2
nd
 defendant a fine of  $1000 for injury to public and $100 for failure to install rotating lights.
40        Mr Tay accepted that it was reasonable for parents to think the park was relatively safe. However, he felt that it was not unusual for a lorry to travel on the footpath. It was, according to him, commonly sighted.  This accident in 1999 was the first involving a child and lorry since he took over in 1996.  There was no evidence as to the year in which lorries were introduced onto the footpath. 
41        He agreed that the there were no signs in the park that children should be accompanied by parents and or any warning that a lorry would enter on the footpath.
42        Mr Tay testified to the efforts of the 1
st
 defendant in procuring a competent independent contractor. The 1
st
 defendant had no knowledge that the 2
nd
 defendant had subcontracted the works as the 2
nd
 defendant had not sought its consent despite being required so to do under the contract.
Sor Kim Hock
43        Mr Soh, a director of the 2
nd
 defendant, testified that the 2
nd
 defendant subcontracted the works under its contract with the 1
st
 defendant to the 3
rd
 defendant under a contract dated 1 September 1999. He did not seek the consent of the 1
st
 defendant.  The operations were then left entirely to the 3
rd
 defendant.
44        Prior to the subcontract, the 3
rd
 defendant was already helping the 2
nd
 defendant in cleaning projects including the Pasir Ris Park. He merely helped him out as a friend and accordingly, he did not pay his CPF. Mr Soh found him good and reliable. The 1
st
 defendant’s contract was not attached to the two page subcontract entered into with the 3
rd
 defendant.  But the fact remained that the 3
rd
 defendant was already aware of the work requirements, having helped the 2
nd
 defendant in the operations prior to the subcontract.
45        I will deal with the claims against each defendant in turn. 
The 1
st
 defendant
The law
Common duty of care
46        It was common ground that the 1
st
 defendant was occupier of the park. 
 
The common duty is to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there.  The relevant circumstances include the degree of care, and of want of care, which would ordinarily be looked for in the visitor, so that in proper cases, the occupier must be prepared for children to be less careful than adults.  In determining whether the occupier has discharged the common duty of care to a visitor regard must be had to all the circumstances.
 
Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore
 
(2000 ed) para 240.281.
Occupier's liability
47        The 1
st
 defendant, as occupier, owed a duty to a licensee, such as the plaintiff, not to create or allow concealed danger to exist in the park, of which the 1
st
 defendant knew or ought to have known.  Willes J in 
Indermaur v. Dames
 
[1886] LR 1
 CP 274, cited by our Court of Appeal in 
Industrial Commercial Bank v. Tan Swe Eng & Ors
 
[1995] 2 SLR 716
, and 
Awang Bin Dollah v. Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd
 
[1197] 3 SLR 677
 at 689 E-F, stated the duty owed by an occupier to an invitee in the following terms:
‘And with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knew or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as a matter of fact…’
In short, the duty of an occupier to an invitee would be to prevent damage or injury from any unusual dangers on the premises he knows or ought to know and which the invitee does not know about.
48            Accordingly, the 1
st
 defendant would be liable if:
(1) The 1
st
 defendant actually knew or ought to have known of the danger that caused the injury;
(2) The danger was unusual to the plaintiff, having regard to the nature of the place and their knowledge;
(3) The danger was unknown to the plaintiff and the significance not appreciated by him; and
(4) The 1
st
 defendant had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
Standard of care
49        The law in all cases exacts a degree of care commensurate with the risk created: 
Read v. Lyons & Co. Ltd
 
[1946] 2 AER 47
.
  The measure of care to be exercised must also be appropriate to the ability of those whose presence ought to be anticipated: 
Glasgow
 
Corporation v. Taylor
 
[1922] 1 AC 44
.  In deciding whether there is a danger, regard must be had to the physical and mental powers of the child visitor: 
Cooke v Midland Great Western Rly of Ireland
 
[1909] AC 229
 at 238. In determining the standard of care owed to a child who is not accompanied by a guardian, it will be material to inquire, whether, in the circumstances, the occupier could reasonably have expected the presence of the child unaccompanied: 
Phipps v. Rochester
 (1955) 1 QBD 451.
50        In 
Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor
, the defendant was liable for the death of a boy aged 7 from eating berries of poisonous shrub in its public gardens.  The danger from the berries was known to the corporation, but it gave no warning of it.  
Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor
 was a Scottish case.  In considering whether corporation used reasonable care for the child's safety, the House of Lords said:
""When the danger is familiar and obvious, no special responsibility attaches to the municipality or owner in respect of an accident having occurred to children of tender years.  The reason of that appears to me to be this, that the municipality or owner is entitled to take into account that reasonable parents will not permit their children to be sent into the midst of familiar and obvious dangers except under protection or guardianship.  The parent or guardian of the child must act reasonably; the municipality or guardian of the park must act reasonably.  This duty rests upon both and each; but each is entitled to assume it of the other.""
51        This was not in reference to the English law of licence, but Scottish, but Devlin J in 
Phipps v. Rochester
 said it expressed perfectly the way in which English case could be applied. He went on to observe:
'A licensor who tacitly permits the public to use his land without discriminating between its members must assume that the public may include little children.  But as a general rule he will have discharged his duty towards them if the dangers which they may encounter are only those which are obvious to a guardian or of which he has given a warning comprehensible by a guardian.  To every general rule there are, of course, exceptions.  A licensor cannot divest himself of the obligation of finding out something about the sort of people who are availing themselves of his permission and the sort of use they are making of it. 
He may have to take into account the social habits of the neighbourhood.  No doubt there are places where little children go to play unaccompanied.  If the licensor knows or ought to anticipate that, he may have to take steps accordingly.
 But the responsibility for the safety of little children must rest primarily upon the parents; it is their duty to see that such children are not allowed to wander about by themselves, or at least to satisfy themselves that the places to which they do allow their children to go unaccompanied are safe for them to go to.  It would not be socially desirable if parents were, as a matter of course, able to shift burden of looking after their children from their own shoulders to those of persons who happen to have accessible bits of land.  
Different considerations may well apply to public parks or to recognized playing grounds where parents allow their children to go unaccompanied in the reasonable belief that they are safe.'
(emphasis mine.)
Issues
Occupier’s liability
52            Accordingly, the 1
st
 defendant would be liable if:  (1) The 1
st
 defendant actually knew or ought to have known of the danger that caused the injury; (2) The danger was unusual to the plaintiff, having regard to the nature of the place and their knowledge; (3) The danger was unknown to the plaintiff and the significance not appreciated by him; and (4) The 1
st
 defendant had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
Negligence
53        The issues arising were:  (1) the purpose for which the child was invited or permitted by the 1
st
 defendant to be at the park; and (2) whether the 1
st
 defendant took such care as in all the circumstances of the case was reasonable to see that the child was reasonably safe in using the park for such purpose.
Findings
This was a park with well developed cycling facilities.  Apart from a well-defined cycling track, there were, located at the park itself, rental facilities for bicycles.  Such facilities made bicycles readily available and encouraged cycling activities at the park.
55            Children’s bicycles were amongst the bicycles available for rent.  In particular, the type of bicycle (Exb P2) which the plaintiff rode at the time of the accident was available for rent.  The bicycle which the plaintiff rode at the time of the accident was rented from such facilities.
56        Running in a rough parallel to the cycling track was the footpath.  The footpath and the cycling track were connected by connecting paths running at right angles to the footpath and cycling track.  A rough sketch of the layout appears at Exb P5.  Clearly, the purpose for which the park users were invited to the park was to cycle and stroll in the park.  It would be fair to say that cycling was a purpose more dominant in this park than in other parks which were not equipped with such cycling facilities.
Standard of care
57        In determining the standard of care owed to the boy, it was material to inquire, whether, in the circumstances, the 1
st
 defendant could reasonably have expected the presence of the child unaccompanied.  
Phipps v. Rochester
 suggested, obiter, that a park is a place where parents allow their children to go unaccompanied in the reasonable belief that they are safe.
58        The 1
st
 defendant argued that the accident occurred because the child was not accompanied by a parent.   The above cases including 
Phipps v. Rochester
 have stated that it is material to enquire whether the occupier could reasonably expect the presence of the child unaccompanied.  It was important however to recognise that the true purpose behind the enquiry.  The purpose of such enquiry was to ascertain if the child was alone when he encountered the danger, or a parent was present to perceive the danger, and to remove the child from the danger.  Unlike the child in those cases, the child in the present case was not on foot.  He was on a bicycle.  This had a significant effect on whether the parent would be present to perceive the danger and whether the parent was able to remove the child from the danger.  It was important to bear in mind how quickly a cyclist could move relative to a person on foot.  A parent on foot would soon be left behind.  Within seconds, the sights and sounds within the child’s radius might be different from the sights and sounds in the parent’s radius.  Admittedly, the parent was better able to recognise the danger, but the danger might not have come into the parent’s field of vision whereas it might have already manifested itself to the child.  It appeared then that a parent on foot accompanying a child cyclist might not be able to see a danger which was already visible to the child cyclist.  Was it reasonable to expect the parent on foot to run to keep abreast with the child cycling?  Or to expect that the parent must cycle with the child?  Assuming for a moment the parent was cycling with the child and able to perceive the danger, was he in a position to remove the child from the danger?  The child was on a bicycle which had a momentum of its own.  If the child in motion on a bicycle stopped pedaling, the bicycle would continue on its course.  To avert an accident, the parent had to assume control of the child’s bicycle, whether by shouting instruction to the child or by direct intervention. Was the parent to shout instruction at a child in the event of danger?  Might that confuse the child, or distract the child from the danger?  A parent on wheels himself might be better able to keep up with the child cyclist and be present to see the dangers the child saw; But he might not necessarily be in a position to remove the child from danger.  Saddled with a bicycle himself, and its attendant duty of care to others, was it reasonable to expect the parent to leap off his bicycle to assume control of the child’s bicycle in the event of danger?
59        What could the 1
st
 defendant reasonably expect the parent to do? After all, this was a park where it was reasonable to expect that the children would cycle, perhaps more so than in other parks.
60        In my view, it was reasonable to expect the parent to keep the boy within view.  There would be occasions where the parent would be able to both perceive the danger, as well as remove the child.  But there would be occasions where the parent might be able to perceive the danger, but be powerless to intervene, and other occasions where the parent might not be able to perceive the danger in time.  I did not think it reasonable to expect a parent on foot to run with the bicycle in order to be in a position to perceive any danger which the child cycling may see.  I also did not think it reasonable to expect a parent cycling with a child must assume control of the child’s bicycle in the event of danger.  Admittedly, this would mean the child cyclist may collide with things in the park such as other cyclists.  But this was all part and parcel of children cycling in a park;  To collide into other cyclists was a usual danger in the park.
61            Accordingly, I was unable to accept the 1
st
 defendant’s case that the accident occurred because the child was not accompanied and the 1
st
 defendant should bear no blame for putting the lorry on the footpath with the boy.
Danger unusual to the plaintiff
62        When the danger is familiar and obvious, no special responsibility attaches to the municipality or owner in respect of an accident having occurred to children of tender years:  
Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor.
  As a general rule, a licensor would have discharged his duty towards little children if the dangers which they encountered are only those which are obvious to a guardian or of which the licensor has given a warning comprehensible by a guardian: 
Phipps v Rochester
.
63        It was difficult to find that the danger of the lorry was familiar or obvious to the parent or for which the 1
st
 defendant had given a warning comprehensible to the parent.  Mr Tay said that prior to the accident, lorries entered the parks and were commonly seen in the parks everyday. This was however not borne out by the evidence nor, more importantly, put to boy or father.  He father in his evidence had said that the 1
st
 defendant breached its duty by allowing the lorry onto the footpath which it knew or ought to have known was unusual and potentially dangerous particularly when the park was meant for pedestrians and cyclists.  It was not put to the father that the lorry was not an unusual danger and that it was commonly sighted in the park.  The law concerning putting matters to a witness in cross-examination which are going to be in issue was well put by Lord Chancellor Herschell in 
Brown v Dunn
 [894] 6 R 67.  Failure to put its case entitled the Court to draw an inference that the 1
st
 defendant had accepted the evidence of the father: 
Brown v Dunn
.  I drew such an inference against the 1
st
 defendant here.
64        Added to this, there was evidence which did not support Mr Tay’s assertion that lorries were commonly sighted in the park.  On weekdays, the lorry was only on the footpath once a day and on weekends twice a day.  The lorry would be out of sight most of the time. Most of the time, it was not present.
65        It was also difficult to find that the 1st defendant had given a warning of the danger of the lorry comprehensible to the parent. The 1
st
 defendant gave no warning signs that the lorry would ply the footpath.  There were no signs that the children should be accompanied by adults. The footpath had footprint marks on it. Without more, the footprints on the footpath were misleading. They gave the erroneous impression that the intended user of the footpath was the pedestrian, when in fact, it was intended that the lorry use the footpath as well. There was a a solitary speed limit sign spotted in a photograph in L's affidavit but this was not referred to at all in the evidence. The Court was left in the dark as to where and how frequently such signs appeared and the response that the plaintiff’s father would have been to this. More importantly, the speed limit sign together with the footprint marks could hardly constitute a warning that 
a lorry
 would enter onto the footpath.
66        Mr Tay said that there would be the other cyclists, a tree or lamppost into which the child may collide. He took the position that because of these dangers, the child ought to be accompanied. Accordingly, the child would be accompanied when the lorry appeared. This argument was flawed. Cyclists, trees and lampposts were commonly sighted on the park. Their presence would not give any alarm to a child cyclist. They would be a usual danger. A child in a park would not be alarmed at the sight of trees, lampposts or cyclists and in a collision with any of these, might well suffer scrapped knees and superficial injuries.  But this was not the case here.  I have already found that the lorry was not commonly sighted. The child may reasonably be alarmed or intimidated at its appearance, as Y was.  He was ‘very frightened’.  Unlike trees and lamp posts, the lorry was mobile. There was a danger which sprang from its mobility. Of course, the other cyclists Mr Tay referred to were mobile too. However, a lorry was very different from a bicycle.  Apart from being much larger in mass than a bicycle, it was powered by an engine. It was not a small motorised vehicle such as a scooter, but a lorry. The large mass of the lorry was a direct component of the force the lorry carried with it, and could inflict on those with whom it came into contact. The boy suffered a cut deep enough to expose the jaw bone or the chin bone. Being hit by a cyclist, trees or lamppost in a park was not an unusual danger, having regard to the nature of the park and the knowledge of the presence of such objects commonly sighted in a park. Being hit by a lorry on a footpath in a park was very different. It was an unusual danger having regard to the nature of the park and the lack of any warning of the presence of the lorry, which was not commonly sighted. It was important to remember that this was not a public road, but a park which had rental facilities for bicycles for children.
67            Accordingly, I found the danger was unusual to the child.  No child is expected to guard against such a danger when he cycles in the park as an invitee.
Danger unknown to the plaintiff
68        The question was whether the child was entitled to protection against this sort of danger. What is not a danger to an adult may be a danger to a child. In deciding whether there is danger, regard must be had to the physical and mental powers of a child visitor:  
Cooke v. Midland Great Western Rly of Ireland
.
69        The lorry on the footpath was a danger imperceptible by a little child of the plaintiff’s age because he was not old enough to see the necessity of avoiding it by applying brakes early. It was concealed from his understanding
. 
 Y’s evidence was that despite seeing the lorry at XB, he continued to move forward until point Y where he applied his brakes. It was only at point Y that he realised that the lorry and he were going to meet.  I found that the danger was unknown to a five year old child.
The 1
st
 defendant knew or ought to have known of danger
70        A licensor may have to take into account the social habits of the neighbourhood. No doubt there are places where little children go to play unaccompanied. If the licensor knows or ought to anticipate that, he may have to take steps accordingly: 
Phipps
 
v Rochester
. Here, there was ample evidence that children cycled on the footpath in a way which ought to have brought home to the 1
st
 defendant the use that was being made of the licence. L produced three photographs (Exb PA1 pg. 16) of the relevant strip of the footpath 3 months after the accident which showed a number of child cyclists cycling on the footpath.   Mr Tay himself accepted that this happened although he qualified that it was to a limited extent.  His evidence elsewhere suggested that the rangers had to warn the child cyclists off the footpath very often.  On the day the photograph (Exb PA1 pg. 16) was taken, the child cyclists were obviously not warned off the footpath.  On the day of the accident, there were no park rangers in Park Area 3 at the time of the accident at 3pm.  I formed the view that far from a limited extent, cyclists including child cyclists used the footpath an extent significant enough for the 1
st
 defendant to take notice.  The 1
st
 defendant knew or ought to have anticipated this and should have taken steps accordingly.
71        I found that the 1
st
 defendant knew of the danger of a lorry journeying on the footpath together with the other park users which included child cyclists.  The 1
st
 defendant restricted the hours the lorry was able to enter the park. It restricted the speed of the lorry when it entered the park. It required a rotating light to be installed atop the lorry. It required its rangers to enforce compliance of the requirement of the rotating light.  By imposing such rules, it was clear that the 1
st
 defendant recognised the danger.  The 1
st
 defendant counsel argued that the 1
st
 defendant had restricted the hours in order that the lorry could clean quickly, and not slowly, when park was crowded. This argument was really the other side of the same coin; When the park was crowded, the path of the lorry would be impeded by presence of park users.  It recognised that the lorry competed with the other users in the use of the footpath and put in place a system where it sought limit the hours of entry and speed of the lorry.
72            Alternatively, the 1
st
 defendant ought to have known of the danger. Imputation of knowledge is based on the state of knowledge at the time
: Industrial Commercial bank v. Tan Swa Eng
.  The 1
st
 defendant said that it had no reason to know of the danger as there had been no previous accident of a similar nature. It was not established when lorries were introduced to the footpath.
73        Mr Tay accepted that the 1
st
 defendant should not have allowed the lorry into the park on Sunday on hindsight
. 
 The 1
st
 defendant knew that child cyclists used the footpath. The 1
st
 defendant also knew of rental facilities for bicycle at the park. Such facilities only increased the frequency of children cycling at the park. The 1
st
 defendant knew that the lorry used the footpath on Sunday afternoons. It knew the width of the footpath. Effectively, the 1
st
 defendant knew that on Sunday afternoons, both the lorry and child cyclists would travel together on the footpath and ought to have known the danger.
Defendant failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage
74        The next question was whether the 1
st
 defendant had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
75
       
 I found that the 1
st
 defendant had failed in this duty. Given that the 1
st
 defendant knew or ought to know that child cyclists used the footpath, it ought to take steps accordingly. Yet, it was the 1
st
 defendant’s specific requirement that a lorry be used to for cleaning the park. The 1
st
 defendant may have chosen a method of refuse disposal which did not require a lorry to enter into the park. One such method would be its current method of employing manual labour to carry the refuse to the lorry parked at the car park. If it was constrained to require the lorry to enter the park, it may have prohibited entry at hours when there would be more children such as Sunday afternoons. Mr Tay agreed that on hindsight, the 1
st
 defendant should not have allowed the lorry into park on Sunday in interest of the safety of park users. And if it was constrained to require the lorry to enter the park on Sunday afternoons, it ought to have given appropriate notice or signs that children should be accompanied by parents or signs to warn the park users, particularly the parents, that a lorry would ply the footpath. Such warning may have been by way of signs erected alongside the footpath featuring a picture of a lorry and the hours it plied. Alternatively, a pictorial presentation of a lorry with its hours of entry may have been printed on the footpath. Without such warning, the footprints printed on the footpath were misleading. The speed limit sign, which  was not referred to at all in the evidence, together with the footprint marks could hardly constitute a warning that 
a lorry
 would enter onto the footpath. With its knowledge that child cyclists used the footpath, the 1
st
 defendant ought to have required a ranger to range ahead of the lorry to keep the footpath clear or close the footpath when the lorry plied. None of this was done.
 
 Up to 5pm on the day of the accident, there were no park rangers in Park Area 3.
Decision
76        I found that the danger of the lorry was unusual to the child cyclist in the park.  It was also unknown to him in that its significance was not appreciated by him until it was too late.  I also found that the 1
st
 defendant knew or ought to have known of the danger of a lorry travelling on the footpath together with bicycle operated by a child limited by his inability and immaturity, and that in providing no warnings, it had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage to the child from its own operations and hazards known to it.
Independent contractor
77        The 1
st
 defendant relied on 
Mohd Bin Sapri v. Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and another appeal
 
[1996] 2 SLR 505
 to argue that the duty of an occupier to use reasonable care to prevent unusual dangers which the occupier knew or ought to have known about, only relates to the physical condition of the premises, as opposed to current operations at the site.  The accident to the plaintiff in that case arose from current operations at the site carried out by the 3
rd
 defendant.  The current operation was carried out in an unsafe manner over which the occupiers, the 1
st
 defendant, had no control.
78        In 
Mohd Bin Sapri
, however, the Court of Appeal also approved (at pg 518-E).  the words of Lord Keith in 
Ferguson v. Welsh & Ors
 [1987] 3 All ER 777 (at p 783):
‘It would not ordinarily be reasonable to expect an occupier of premises having engaged a contractor whom he has reasonable grounds for regarding as competent, to supervise the contractor’s activities in order to ensure that he was discharging his duty to his employees to observe a safe system of work.  In special circumstances, on the other hand, where the occupier knows or has reason to suspect that the contractor is using an unsafe system of work, it might well be reasonable for the occupier to take steps to see that the system was made safe.
 
                 
79        In the present case, the 1
st
 defendant did not merely know of, endorse or approve any unsafe system.  It was the 1st defendant which set up the unsafe system. 
80        In 
Mohd Bin Sapri,
 the Court of Appeal also made it clear (at p 514) that:
‘A person who appoints independent contractors does not, ipso facto, absolve himself of any liability in negligence to the employees of his independent contractors.  He may still be liable where the working conditions were inherently dangerous, thereby requiring the exercise of significant degree of supervision and control over persons with whom he has no contractual relationship.  Alternatively,…he may have to observe such a duty if he had taken it upon himself to exercise a degree of control and actively co-ordinate the independent contractor’s activities, given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or danger.  Thus, both elements of ‘danger’ and ‘control’ will have to be considered. (emphasis added).’ 
81        Taking first the element of danger, was there danger?  The 1
st
 defendant had to take into account the habit of the children in cycling on the footpath and take steps accordingly:  
Phipps v. Rochester.
  The photographs at PA1, pg. 16 showed children cycling on the footpath.  Exb P1 showed how much of the road the lorry occupied.  The question was this:  Was there danger in a lorry and a child cyclist journeying together on a footpath of that width?
82        The child cyclist is limited in his development and consequently his ability to appropriately manage his bicycle in relation to the lorry.  To avoid the lorry, the child had to execute a series of acts:  first, to perceive that their paths would meet unless he stopped; secondly to break his motion of peddling forward; and thirdly, to apply his brakes early enough, and with sufficient strength in order to bring his moving bicycle to a halt.  A range of faculties including mental, cognitive, emotional and motor skills were involved.  A child might not be able to perceive that unless he did something to avert or stop, he and the lorry would meet;  Even if a child was able to perceive so, he might be overwhelmed by fear or lack the requisite motor skills to stop his bicycle in time.  
83        On his part, the driver seated elevated in the lorry was less able to see the low bicycles the children rode.
84        The footpath was not wide and the lorry occupied a large part of the footpath. With both the lorry and the child cyclist in motion on the same footpath, the limited width of the footpath and the size of the lorry increased the danger that the lorry and the child cyclist would come into contact.
85        Turning next to the element of control, the1
st
 defendant had control over who came onto the footpath. It had control over the means by which the refuse was to be removed and it chose a method that required the use of motorised contraption. It had control over the type of contraption and it chose a lorry.  It had control over where the lorry was to be located, whether within or without the park at the carpark.  It decided that the lorry would enter the park. It had control over the path that lorry would take and it decided that the lorry would take the footpath despite its knowledge of child cyclists thereon.  It had control over the hours when the lorry could enter the park and it decided that the lorry would enter into the park on Sunday afternoons.  It had control over the safety requirements of cleaning and safety aspects of the park.  It chose to erect no warning signs nor did it restrict access to the footpath at the time the lorry plied.
86            Accordingly, I find the 1
st
 defendant liable qua occupier or alternatively, qua joint tortfeasor with the 3
rd
 defendant in negligence.  It may look to the 2
nd
 defendant to be indemnified under clause 22(a) of its contract with the 2
nd
 defendant.
The 3
rd
 defendant
87        I found that the accident was caused in part because the boy due to his limited faculties as a child, was unable to respond appropriately to the appearance of the lorry and failed to brake in time. I also found that the accident was caused in part because the lorry driver failed to keep a proper lookout. Looking at the photographs (Exb PA1, pg 16), it was clear that there was ample opportunity for the lorry driver to see the boy’s approach. Had he done so, he would have seen the boy’s approach before he applied his brakes, and his failed attempt at braking. Although those travelling on the footpath had the right of way over those emerging from the link path, the lorry driver could not ignore the boy’s approach and eventual entry onto the footpath, however wrongful it may have been.  It was incumbent on the part of the lorry driver to keep a proper lookout and to take evasive action once it became apparent to him that their paths would meet. This would have been apparent as the boy approached the footpath before he applied his brakes.  Prior to the boy applying his brake, the lorry driver would have seen that the boy was going too fast to stop at the junction to give way to him.  Accordingly, I found the lorry driver, and consequently, the 3
rd
 defendant liable for the accident.
The 2
nd
 defendant
Issues
88        The issues were:  (1) Whether the 3
rd
 defendant was independent contractor or servant and agent of the 2
nd
 defendant; (2) In the event the 3
rd
 defendant was independent contractor, whether there was negligence on the part of the 2
nd
 defendant in selecting an incompetent contractor; and (3) Whether the 2
nd
 defendant was joint occupier of the park from which may arise non-delegable duties in certain situations.
The law
89        If the employer has employed an independent contractor to do work on his behalf the general rule is that the employer is not responsible for any tort committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work and in this respect the employees of the contractor, whilst acting as such, stand in the same position as their employer, so that the employer of the contractor is not liable for the torts committed by the contractor’s employees:  
Penny v. Wimbledon U.D.C.
 
[1899] 2 Q.B. 72
, 
D. & F. Estates Ltd v. Church Commissioners for England
 [1988] 3.W.L.R 368, HL. Although the damage complained of may have been caused by an independent contractor, it may also be attributable to the negligence of the employer, for example, where he has negligently selected an incompetent contractor, he will himself have committed a tort for which he can be held liable:  
Clerk & Lindsell
 18 ed. Para 5-48.
90        The test of whether the 3
rd
 defendant is independent contractor or servant is whether there exists a right of control over the manner in which the work is to be done:  
Performing Right Society v. Mitchell & Booker
 
[1924] 1 KB 726
.
Decision
91        There was no evidence that the 2
nd
 defendant controlled the manner in which the work was done.
 
 The 2
nd
 defendant’s evidence was that it engaged the 3
rd
 defendant as independent contractor and that at no time was the 3
rd
 defendant under its supervision or control. Although the simple three page subcontract could not possibly provide the 3
rd
 defendant with the requirements of the 1
st
 defendant, this really did not matter in the light of the unrebutted evidence that the 3
rd
 defendant had already been doing the work prior to the subcontract.  The 2
nd
 defendant had left the matter entirely to the 3
rd
 defendant.  Accordingly, I found that the 3
rd
 defendant was the independent contractor of the 2
nd
 defendant.
92        There was no evidence to suggest that the 3
rd
 defendant was incompetent.  The unrebutted evidence was that he was good and reliable.
93        As for the plaintiff’s argument the 2
nd
 defendant was occupier, there was a paucity of evidence that the 2
nd
 defendant had any control at all.  The evidence disclosed that having subcontracted the work, the 2
nd
 defendant was not controlling the operations or involved in any substantial supervisory or co-ordinating capacity.  The 2
nd
 defendant left the works entirely to the 3
rd
 defendant.  The 2
nd
 defendant was not at the site.  It went once in six months for random checks.  Accordingly, I was unable to find that the 2
nd
 defendant was occupier and consequently, no non-delegable duty could arise.  The 2
nd
 defendant was not liable for the tort of the 3
rd
 defendant, its independent contractor.
94            Counsel for the plaintiff indicated that 2
nd
 defendant was in breach of its obligations under the contract in subcontracting the cleaning works to independent contractors without the consent of the 1
st
 defendant. While this may constitute a breach of contract between the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 defendants, it could not found tortious liability for the 2
nd
 defendant.
The plaintiff
95        The accident was caused in part by the boy’s failure to control his bicycle and his failure to brake.
 
 Although the1
st
 defendant alleged contributory negligence on the part of Y, it did not plead nor, was not put to Y, that he should not have been on the connecting path emerging onto the footpath. The 1
st
 defendant did not take issue with his path of travel. 
96        Adults and big children can be guilty of contributory negligence; a little child cannot:  
Phipps v. Rochester
. The question of contributory negligence on the part of a child is dependent on the circumstances.  A very young child cannot be guilty of negligence; an older child may be. A judge should only find a child guilty of contributory negligence if he or she was of such an age as to be expected to take precautions for his or her own safety and should only make such a finding if blame could be attached to him or her:  Lord Denning in 
Gough v. Thorne
 
[1966] 1 WLR 1387
.
97        In 
Abraham v. Choo Jit Fung
 
[1965] SLR 90
, the Federal Court of three judges held that a girl of seven years plus should not be held in any degree or in any way blame for the accident when she crossed the road.  Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin, as he then was, approved the trial judge who said:
“She acted as a normal child of her age would have done under the circumstances.  Children are children and they are not expected to act with the same degree of caution as an adult person.  Their judgment of things cannot be said to be as high as that of an adult individual.”
98
       
 In 
Ang Eng Lee v. Lim Lye Soon
 
[1986] SLR 116
, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the High Court and allowed the child’s claim but with contributory negligence of 1/3 liability.  The Court of Appeal was of the view that the child, an eight year old was old enough to exercise reasonable care in not running across the road in the path of oncoming lorry.  In the instant case, Y was five years old at the material time.  He was cycling in a park.
99        In 
Gardner v. Grace
 [1858] 1 F. & F. 359, the Court was of the view that a three and a half year old child who ran out to the road and was knocked down was not contributorily negligent.
100      
Ang Eng Lee’s
 case concerned a child crossing a road.  One would ordinarily expect traffic, including lorries, on the road.  I had found that the lorry was not commonly sighted at the park.  I did not think it could be said that one would ordinarily expect a lorry in a park where children were cycling. 
101      Unlike the child of eight years in
 
Ang Eng Lee’s
 
case, Y was only five years old at the material time.  Considering the faculties of a five year old child, I was not inclined to find that a five year old was old enough to be expected to take precautions for his own safety when a lorry appeared in its path in a park.  To avoid the lorry, he would have to be able to execute the series of steps outlined above.  This might be reasonably expected of an older child with fully developed faculties, but not of a five year old boy. He was behaving as a child with the inability and immaturity of a 5 year old would to the unusual appearance of the lorry in a park.  Accordingly, I found no contributory negligence on the part of Y.
Joint liability
102      Where injury has been done to the plaintiff and the injury is indivisible, any tortfeasor whose act has been a proximate cause of the injury must compensate for the whole of it.  As between the plaintiff and the defendant it is immaterial that there are others whose acts also have been a cause of the injury and it does not matter whether those others have or have not a good defence.  These factors would be relevant in a claim between tortfeasors for contribution, but the plaintiff is not concerned with that; he can obtain judgment for total compensation from anyone whose acts has been a cause for his injury:
 
Dingle v. Associated Newspaper Ltd and Others
 
[1961] 2 QB 162
.  In
 
Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v. Setron Ltd and anor appeal
 
[2000] 1 SLR 166
 the Court of Appeal held (at p 168):
‘Where the damage or injury was occasioned by more than one party, the question whether there should be joint or separate liability depended essentially on the facts and in particular the damage caused.  If the damage caused could be identified and isolated as attributable to the negligent act or the breach of contract of each party, then a separate Judgment in respect of that damage can be entered against each of the parties.  If, however, the damage caused by the parties could not be so indentified and isolated, but form indivisible parts of the entire damage, it would not be possible to enter separate Judgments against each of them.’
103      Each of them, the 1
st
 defendant and 3
rd
 defendant, though not acting in concert, committed a tort contemporaneously and caused the same or indivisible damage.  Each of them is liable for the whole damage.  A joint judgment for the whole damage was proper.
104      The general principle governing the apportionment of liability is found in ss 15(1) and 16(1) of the Civil Law Act Cap 43, 1991 Ed) which provide:
15(1)  Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise)….
16(1)  Subject to subsection (3), in any proceedings for contribution under section 15, the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in question.
105      These provisions are, in all material respects, the same as ss 1(1) and 2(1) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 of the United Kingdom.  In
 
Fitzgerald v. Lane & Anor
 
[1989] AC 328
 at 339, Lord Ackner said:
In the contribution proceedings, whether or not they are heard during the trial of the main action or by separate proceedings, the court is concerned to discover what contribution is just and equitable, having regard to the responsibility between the tortfeasors inter se, for the damage which the Plaintiff has been adjudged entitled to recover.
106      In the present case, the driver did not come to court.  There was no evidence from him as to respective speeds of his lorry and the boy prior to the accident, or their respective positions when he first saw the boy and when he first realised the boy was not going to stop at the junction to give way to him.  I also had no evidence from him as to whether the height of the lorry obstructed his view of the boy on his low bicycle and whether he (the lorry driver), applied his brake.  I had the boy’s evidence and the photographs of the location.  The boy did not testify as to the speed of the lorry.  Although he said that he did not see the lorry driver brake when he (the boy) braked, I doubt very much if he could have seen the lorry driver apply his brakes.  What he did see was that the lorry continued to move.  But he did not testify to its speed although he said on impact, the lorry stopped.  In the absence of evidence enabling the Court to draw a distinction between their blameworthiness, it should hold them blameworthy in equal proportions:

.
107            Accordingly, a just and equitable apportionment of the liability between the two defendants would be on an equal basis and I ordered that liability for the damages, interest and costs for the plaintiff and 2
nd
 defendant be apportioned equally between them.
Anxiety Disorder
108      There was an appeal against my decision not to allow the plaintiff’s claim for damages for anxiety disorder.  Dr Woo, a child psychiatrist, gave evidence that Y suffered from anxiety disorder which was likely to be a result of the accident. After the accident, he had nightmares of monsters about once weekly, precipitated by watching on the television cartoons of robots fighting and reports of road traffic accidents. He had a fear of the dark after the accident. He had been sleeping alone before the accident but did not dare to sleep alone after the accident. Dr Woo said that his nightmares had since stopped and he was able to sleep alone at night. However, he still had a fear of the dark. His symptoms had improved and his prognosis was good.
109            Counsel for the plaintiff’s argued that anxiety disorder was similar to, although less severe than, post traumatic stress disorder, and invited the Court to award $10,000 under this new head of damage not hitherto recognised in our courts.  He relied on the following cases: 
Goh Eng Hong v. The MCST of Textile Centre Strata Titles
 No 695 (Suit No 307 of 1998)(High Court unreported), where the plaintiff suffered post traumatic stress disorder with symptoms of fear when entering the lift. She needed to be accompanied for most part of her life, avoided items which remind her of her traumatic experience, and was dependent on people and medication and needed ongoing treatment.  She was awarded $30,000.  In 
Pang Koi Fa v. Lim Djoe Phing
 
[1993] 3 SLR 317
, the plaintiff was awarded $30,000 for post traumatic stress disorder with symptoms of personality change, frequently quarrelled and contemplated suicide.  In 
Edwards v. Maurice Wood
 (1996 unreported), the 12 year old plaintiff was awarded 1,424 pounds when he suffered post traumatic stress disorder with nightmares and fear of travelling two weeks after the accident.  He improved after several weeks.  In 
Davies v. Edmonds
 (1999 unreported), the plaintiff after an accident suffered mild re-experience phenomena, was nervous of motor vehicle travel and irritable and anxious for a month.  The symptoms were not deemed significant enough to constitute post traumatic stress disorder, clinical depression or clinical anxiety.  She was diagnosed with mild phobic response and the prognosis was favourable.  She was awarded 1,350 pounds.
110      I declined to recognise a new head.  The plaintiff’s anxiety disorder appeared to be of a more temporary nature than post traumatic stress disorder.  Every accident would be traumatic.  Our courts had hitherto recognised the suffering of a trauma if it had very great impact on their lives, such as for post traumatic stress disorder.  By the plaintiff’s own quantification, the amount sought was only $10,000. I felt that it would be more appropriate to take the anxiety disorder into account in assessing the quantum of damages under the established heads of pain and suffering and did so accordingly.",2003-10-16 00:00:00,SG Magistrates' Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 17 March 1981 at about 2.45pm Chan Kong Hwa alias A Wa (the deceased) was driving his motor car on his side of Tampines Road, when a lorry veered on to his road and collided with his motor car. At 3.45pm on the same day he died from the injuries which he received. The lorry was owned by the third defendants, Eng Bee & Co Pte Ltd, and was driven at the time by the first defendant, Sim Kok Lee, in the course of his employment with the third defendants. The second defendants, Boon Yam & Co, were motor repairers who were the regular repairers for the third defendants` vehicles and had also attended to the lorry in question. This action under the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) was brought by the plaintiffs as the administratrix and co-administrator of the deceased ` s estate for the benefit of the estate and his dependants.
 Liability 
At the trial, six witnesses gave evidence for the plaintiffs, and a total of seven witnesses for the defendants. In his defence, the first defendant (DW2) said that he had been employed by the third defendants as a lorry attendant since 1973. In January 1980 he had become a lorry driver and had been assigned to drive this lorry. After the accident, he had ceased to be a driver, and was now a storekeeper. On Saturday 14 March 1981, some three days before the accident, he said that he found the steering of his lorry to be very heavy and reported the matter to his supervisor, Tay Kim Beng (DW5). He was instructed to send the lorry to the second defendants for the necessary repairs. He had had many occasions in the past to take the lorry to them for various purposes and, up to that date, had done so on more than ten occasions. At the second defendants` premises, he explained the problem to one Ah Yam and left the lorry there for the problem to be attended to.
On Monday 16 March 1981 at about 5pm he took back the lorry after being told by Ah Yam that the problem had been attended to. As this was already in the late afternoon, he drove the lorry to his home and parked it overnight in an HDB car park. On the following day, the lorry was driven by him for a considerable distance: first, he drove it to his employer` s store in Geylang and carried a load of building materials from the store to a customer in King George` s Avenue near the employer ` s office; from there he drove it to the office to collect a delivery order for a second load; then he drove it again to the store, collected the load, and delivered it to a customer in Woodlands; finally, he drove the lorry back, this time unladen, towards the store, in the course of which the accident took place. He confirmed a statement which he had made at the earlier in the coroner`s court, that he was on the road for about five hours that day and covered a total distance of about 80km before the accident.
The first defendant`s evidence on the cause of the accident was in effect that the steering failed suddenly. Just before this happened, he was driving normally along a two-way stretch of road, on his own side of the road, and at a speed of no more th an 20 to 30 km/h, because there were speed regulating strips on the road surface. He recalled that he felt the road surface to be uneven as he drove over the strips, but in spite of this the lorry was moving normally. After he had passed the strips and was some five lorry-lengths beyond them, the lorry suddenly went out of control. He said that he shouted to his lorry attendant that the steering was not working. He jammed on his brakes. He was still on his own side of the road, but the lorry went over to the other side and collided with an oncoming motor car driven by the deceased.
After the collision, he got down from his lorry. He went to a telephone kiosk and made three telephone calls: for an ambulance; to his supervisor, Tay Kim Beng, to inform him of the accident; and to Ah Yam when he asked Ah Yam why the steering had failed. According to him, Ah Yam said he would go to the scene and have a look. The accident happened at about 2.45pm. He said that he was away from the scene to make his telephone calls for about ten minutes and got back to the scene at about 2.55pm or 3pm. A police officer, not the Inspector whom he saw later, was there. He did not remove anything from the lorry, and did not see anyone else remove anything. According to him, there were no tools in the lorry, apart from a screw-driver.
The lorry attendant, Lim Kow Nee (DW3), was not particularly helpful as a witness. While he substantially corroborated the first defendant` s evidence in respect of the delivery of goods to customers on that day, he was confused about the circumstances at the time of the collision. Of particular interest, he said that at the time of the collision he heard the first defendant say, ` Die, no steering` . Under cross-examination, he was not sure whether these words were said before or after the collision, although he had said at the earlier inquiry that he heard this said a few moments before the collision.
Inspector Roger Yeo Kong (PW4), an officer attached to the Traffic Police in March 1981, arrived at the scene of the accident at 4.38pm on 17 March 1981. He said in evidence at the inquiry on 31 July 1981 that he found, among other things, that the steering drag link of the lorry was disconnected from the drop arm, and t he nut securing the two parts together was missing. The lorry was sent at 5.30pm on the same day to the Force Transport Branch, where it was placed in a fenced and guarded compound. It was examined there on 21 March 1981 by Foo Yin Fatt (PW3), an engineer attached to the Force Transport Branch of the Singapore Police Force. Following his examination he reported that the speedometer, the handbrake and the footbrakes were in order, and the tyres were in serviceable condition; but he also reported that the drag link and the drop arm, both of which were component parts of the steering system of the lorry, were disconnected. The disconnection, in his opinion, made it impossible to steer the lorry.
Tong Teck Tiong (DW1), a director of the third defendants, told the court that his company had dealt in building materials since 1964. To deliver them to customers, the company had its own fleet of lorries. In 1981 there were six lorries in the fleet. The company did not have a service department of its own, however, and for some ten years before the accident had been sending its vehicles to the second defendants for servicing and for repairs. This included preparing the company` s lorries for the periodical examinations by officers of the Registry of Vehicles. The company had been happy with the services provided by the second defendants and had no complaints. Even after the accident and up to the date of the trial, the company` s standing instructions were still to send all the lorries to the second defendants. The second defendants billed the company each time for work done. They sent an invoice for $91 for repairs done on 16 March 1981 to the lorry in question before the accident. This invoice had been paid in cash and had then been entered in the cash book of the company.
Cheng Kuang Bong, (DW6), a motor mechanic who in 1981 was also one of the two partners of the second defendants, Boon Yam & Co, who are sued as a firm in this action, gave evidence. (He appeared to be the same person who was referred to by the first defendant at various times in his evidence as Ah Boon and as Ah Yam.) He said in his evidence that the lorry was sent to them for repairs at about 4pm on Saturday 14 March 1981, at which time the first defendant complained that the steering was stiff. This being late in the afternoon on a Saturday, he told the first defendant to leave the lorry with him and to come back for it after the weekend on the following Monday, 16 March 1981. On the Monday morning, he did repair work on the lorry for some two hours, during which the steering system was repaired. He found that there was no oil in it which was the cause of the stiffness in the steering. Under cross-examination he confirmed that the shortage of oil was something which would only take five or ten minutes to remedy. He claimed that he also changed the drag link. This involved disconnecting the drag link from the drop arm so as to fit on the new drag link. To do the reconnection he used a special ` nyloc` nut which could not come loose. He did not use a split pin because there was no provision for a split pin in the new drag link which he used. After the repairs, the lorry was jacked up. He manoeuvred the steering to assure himself that it was now in order, but he did not test-drive the lorry. Later that day, at about 5pm the first defendant came to the workshop and took back the lorry.
Cheng Kuang Bong said that it was Tay Kim Beng (DW5), the supervisor, who telephoned him between 2.35pm and 2.45pm on 17 March 1981 and told him about the accident. Tay Kim Beng told him to go to the scene and take a look. He got there about 10 to 15 minutes after receiving the call, before the police arrived. The first defendant was also not there, and only came back to the scene some time later. When he examined the lorry after he arrived at the scene, he found that the drag link and the drop arm were disconnected. He did not see the nut which he had fitted on, and he was unable to account for its absence. He agreed that it was not his practice to go to the scene of an accident; he went on this occasion only because Tay Kim Beng had asked him to go, and as the steering had been repaired by him and the driver had complained that the steering had failed at the time of the accident. He said that, when he examined the lorry at the scene of the accident, he did not disconnect the drag link and the drop arm.
Denis Packard (DW7), a qualified automotive mechanical engineer, was called by the first and third defendants as an expert witness to support the evidence of the first defendant. He had previously submitted a written report to suggest that the first defendant` s account was entirely possible. In his opinion, the heavy steering could have been caused by lack of oil, because the oil in the system could have leaked past the seals. The real thrust of his evidence, however, was to cast doubt on the work done by the repairers and to suggest that, in reconnecting the drag link to the drop arm, the repairers had by an oversight omitted to put on a nut to secure the two parts together, but had merely slid the drag link tapered end into the corresponding drop arm taper. This created what he explained at every considerable length as a jamming effect. The single impact of a relatively minor hammer or a large spanner would cause further jamming at the taper. In this condition a vehicle could be driven without the driver having any indication of looseness in the steering because there was no looseness at the taper until it broke free of itself. However, once the taper jamming broke, the parts would probably disconnect altogether in a very short space of time, perhaps in a few seconds. It was possible for the drag link to ` pop-out` entirely from its taper-jammed position in a single action. For the driver, there would be an almost instantaneous deterioration from full steering control to no steering control at all. In his opinion, it was possible that when the vehicle went through the speed regulating strips or other rough surface irregularities, the taper jamming effect between the two parts came adrift. When this happened and the brakes were applied, the vehicle could have skidded in a straight ahead fashion or it could just as likely have deviated.
Under cross-examination, Denis Packard admitted that he would not be happy driving a vehicle without a nut in place to secure together the drag link and drop arm and just rely on the jamming effect alone, although the real security would be in the ta per, and any nut or pin would only be a secondary consideration. On being shown in court the enlargements of the photographs of the steering system in the lorry, he expressed the opinion that the drag link in the enlargements (which he called the tie-rod end) was clearly not new, that there was provision for a split pin, and that the thread on the shank could be seen through a magnifying glass, although it looked worn. He also agreed that if the drag link had not been replaced, the alleged repairs could not have been done, and the question of whether the second defendants as repairers had put in a nut or had omitted to put in a nut did not arise.
The defence of the first and third defendants was therefore that the cause of the accident was the failure of the steering system. When this failed, the first defendant had no control over the lorry, which veered on to the wrong side of his road despite attempts by him to control it, and it then collided into the oncoming motor car driven by the deceased. This failure of the steering system resulted from the drag link and the drop arm becoming disconnected. Both these parts had not been properly reconnected together when the lorry left the workshop of the second defendants but had merely been ` jammed together`. The parts had held together in this way only up to the time when the first defendant found that he no longer had control over the steering. That was when these parts came adrift. Up to then they were joined by the jamming effect alone.
Lew Chan Phon (PW6), another qualified automotive mechanical engineer, was called by the plaintiffs as an expert witness. He was forthright in dismissing the ` jamming effect` theory. Under cross-examination by counsel for the first and third defendants, he said he was convinced that with only the jamming effect and without a nut to secure the drag link to the drop arm, it would have been impossible for the vehicle to travel in the town. Certainly, the jamming effect would not have lasted the five hours and the 80km which the lorry travelled on the day of the accident. Under cross-examination by counsel for the second defendants, he maintained this view.
As the evidence then unfolded, it was suggested by counsel for the plaintiffs that two questions emerged over the repairs to the lorry. First, how were the repairs carried out by the second defendants on the day before the accident and were these repairs carried out properly? According to Cheng Kuang Bong (DW6), he not only put in some oil, but also changed the entire drag link set and fixed the two parts together with a special ` nyloc` nut which could not have come loose. He did not put in a split pin because there was no provision for a split pin in the part which he used. The thrust of the arguments of the first and third defendants, however, was that the second defendants never did the repairs which they claimed to have done, that they probably only replenished the oil and changed the seal, and in the process of reconnecting the drag-link and drop arm omitted or failed to put in a nut and a split pin. As evidence of this, they brought in another expert witness, Yan Fook Sum (DW4), an assessor and surveyor who was instructed by the insurance company to inspect the damaged lorry and who said in his evidence that the thread of the ball joint of the drag link was in worn out condition: ` If you screw a nut to hold it to the drop arm, it would not hold. The whole tie-rod ought to have been changed.`
The second question suggested was whether the lorry had been sent for repairs at all before the accident. The first and third defendants claimed that the second defendants had issued an invoice after the repairs, but this invoice was never produced and was said by the first defendant to have been handed by him on the day of the accident to the Sepoy Lines police, a statement which was not clarified later in any way. As against Cheng Kuang Bong` s claim that he had changed the drag link and put in a ` nyloc` nut without a split pin because there was no provision for a split pin, the photographs of the drag link of the lorry taken after the accident clearly sho wed a provision in the drag link for a split pin. Equally significant was the evidence of Foo Yin Fatt (PW3), the police mechanical engineer who was an independent witness. In his report, he said that as far as he could recall the drag link could not have been new. But the thread at the ball joint was intact, with no visible damage to the thread. If the nut had been forced out in any way, the thread would have been damaged, and his firm conclusion was that the nut was removed after the collision.
As the accident took place in 1981, many years before this action came on for hearing, it was inevitable that memories had become blurred by the passage of time, and a considerable amount of detail in the evidence of witnesses was not as satisfactory as it should have been. Much of the evidence was also self-serving, even if it was not untrue. This made it all the more difficult to tread a logical path through the contradictions in the evidence. In such cases, a court has no alternative but to piece together the contrasting picture to the extent possible, making such allowances for inaccuracies and obscurities as would be reasonable in the circumstances.
In my judgment, the lorry was sent to the second defendants for the stiffness in the steering to be attended to. It was found on examination that the stiffness was the result of a lack of oil in the steering system, and accordingly all that the second defendants did was to add some oil to the system. This was sufficient to cure the stiffness, and to enable the first defendant to drive the lorry normally and without complaint on Tuesday 17 March 1981 before the accident. The drag link or the tie-rod was not changed when the steering was repaired, contrary to the evidence of Cheng Kuang Bong, who claimed that he put in a new drag link without a provision for a split pin to be used, when the photographic enlargement of the part in the damaged lorry clearly showed a drag link with such a provision. There was no evidence that it was necessary to change the drag link, and the evidence of all the technical witnesses - Foo Yin Fatt, the police engineer; Denis Packard, the first and third defendant` s expert; and Yan Fook Sum, the insurance company` s assessor and surveyor - was that the drag link or tie-rod found on the lorry after the accident could not have been new.
When the lorry was taken back from the second defendants on Monday 16 March 1981, the drag link must have been secured to the drop arm by both a nut and a split pin. In my judgment, the lorry could not have been driven before the accident on the following day for some five hours and some 80km relying on the ` jamming effect` alone. Neither can I find that the drag link and the drop arm were somehow forced apart, and thereby resulted in the steering failing. The parts of the thread on the shank, albeit worn, were sufficiently visible in the photographic enlargements to suggest that the thread had not been damaged in the way it undoubtedly would have been if the drag link and the drop arm had been forced apart, either before the accident or even by the impact of the collision. The nut and split pin were found to be missing after the collision, and the only logical inference to draw was that the nut and split pin were removed after the collision. It was not disputed that it would take an ordinary person only about five minutes or so to remove the nut, and a mechanic would take less than that time if the right tools were available. Yan Fook Sum (DW6), the automobile surveyor and assessor, found that the appropriate tools - nut opener, pliers - were available in the lorry itself. After the nut and split pin were removed, a blow with a hammer or spanner would separate the drag link and drop arm, as Cheng Kuang Bong demonstrated. Cheng Kuang Bong however was an u ncertain and unsatisfactory witness. On this occasion, contrary to usual practice, he was either sent by Tay Kim Beng, the supervisor, or went in response to a request from the first defendant that he go to the scene of the accident. Whoever it was who sent him to the scene, he went because he was told that the driver had complained that the steering failed at the time of the accident. He arrived at the scene of the accident in some haste, only 10 to 15 minutes after the telephone call from the first defendant and well before any of the police arrived. He removed the nut and pin, and disconnected the drag link and drop arm. He could have done this to avoid any suggestion that he had not carried out the repairs properly; more likely, because a person had been killed, he wanted to protect their customer and show that the accident was the result of some mechanical failure. Whatever his reason was, it was a stupid thing to do, because it could have resulted in his own firm becoming liable. It led to the production of a large bundle of accounts and invoices, bills and receipts which were unreliable and unhelpful as evidence. It also led to the mystery of the missing nut and split pin diverting attention from the real issue in this case and taking up a lot of court time.
I now turn to the question of what in my judgment was the actual cause of the accident and who was the person liable for it. The first defendant claimed that he was travelling normally at a speed of 30 km/h just before the accident, and that the relatively slow speed was because of the speed regulating strips on the road. The relevance of the speed regulating strips was contradicted by the evidence of the police investigating officer, Inspector Roger Yeo Kong (PW4), under cross-examination in the coroner` s court inquiry: 
 
Q: At scene of accident just before the actual bend was there speed reducing strips there?
 
 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any one of these nearby? 
 
A: No. They are quite far from scene of accident.
  
 
 
The police sketch plan showed very long brake marks of 10.3m and 12.1m which in the circumstances at the time suggested a violent and desperate braking at a very considerable speed, well in excess of the maximum speed limit of 50km/h along Tampines Road at that time. There could not have been any other explanation for these brake marks other than the very considerable speed at which the lorry was travelling when the brakes were applied, as the lorry was not loaded at that time. From these marks, the lorry appeared to have veered first to the left, and then to the right, and finally to have come to a stop only when it hit the motor car of the deceased, leaving long brake marks. When the first defendant realized that the lorry was veering to the left because of the speed, and was about to hit the curb on the left, he swerved the steering to the right, applied the brakes, and lost control. This was clearly negligence on his part, and vicariously on the part of his employers, the third defendants, for which they were liable in damages to the plaintiffs.
 Damages 
At the date of his death, the deceased was 32 years of age. He left a widow and two very young sons, one born in March 1977 and the other in February 1981. He was a lieutenant in the Singapore Armed Forces Commandos earning $1,216.98 per month. He had a secondary education up to Middle School III at the Chinese High School in Segamat in Malaysia. This would be below the GCE ` O` level. He joined the SAF on 27 May 1971 and in the normal course his term of service would expire on 11 March 1999. He joined on another rank and had been promoted second lieutenant in March 1975, and to lieutenant in April 1977. His previous commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Boon Hon Lim who had known him since his joining the SAF said in evidence that he had in 1981 a potential rating to become a lieutenant-colonel, but he could not say when this might come about, because ` you cannot guarantee promotion` . Assessment of an officer for purposes of promotion was at three levels - unit level, formation level, and army commander level, and all three levels would have to approve any junior promotion. According to the widow, he gave her by way of support $750 per month, out of which he consumed food at home to the value of only $50 per month because he only had occasional meals at home, so that the net loss of dependency to her was $700 per month.
 Estate` s claim 
The cause of action having arisen in 1981, the claim for the estate of the deceased was made under s 8 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) before the coming into force of the 1987 amendments. There was no evidence as to whether the deceased was conscious or unconscious after the accident and before he wa s pronounced dead about an hour later, and I therefore award no amount for pain and suffering. For loss of expectation of life I award the conventional amount of $7,000. For the loss of future earnings in the lost years, I am of the opinion that it would be fairer to base this on a retirement rank of major, rather than a rank of captain or lieutenant-colonel on the evidence available. I have therefore based my calculation on the median of his pay at the date of the accident of $1,216.98 and a major`s pay on retirement of $4,055 to arrive at the figure for his probable lost earnings. After making deductions for income tax, adding back the employer`s CPF contributions, and taking an available surplus of 40%, I have applied to the resulting multiplicand a multiplier of 14 and rounded up the figure to $215,000 for loss of future earnings. Accordingly, I award a total of $222,000 on the estate`s claim.
 Special damages 
These have been agreed at $7,000 to cover the funeral expenses, damage to the deceased` s motor car, and a vehicle inspection report fee, which were claimed.
 Dependants` claim 
The widow and the two children were wholly dependent on the deceased for support, and by his death they have been deprived of this support. After his death, the family was awarded by the Armed Forces Council a lump sum gratuity of $45,000 as his death was considered as a result of service; additionally, the widow has been awarded a monthly pension of $311.67 while she remains unmarried, and each of the two children receives $62.33 per month which will continue until he reaches the age of 18 years or becomes self-supporting. These payments by the Armed Forces Council, however, must be disregarded in considering the dependants` claim in this action in view of s 12(3) of the Civil Law Act. It is not disputed that, before his death, the deceased gave the widow $750 per month, out of which the cost of his occasional meals at home was estimated at $50 per month, leaving the widow $700 per month for the support of herself and the children. Some allowance must be made for increases in his take-home pay in the period between his death and the date of judgment following trial, and an average figure of $1,000 per month is in my judgment a fair assessment of the loss of pre-trial dependency. This will amount to about 117 months or about $117,000. As with the estimate of pre-trial loss, the estimate of future loss of support is fraught with difficulties, but the court must do the best it can on the evidence before it. Taking into account his promotion prospects and resultant increased earnings, the proportion of his earnings which he has been giving to his dependants, and the fact that the two children were born in 1977 and 1981, I assess the future loss of support of $1,500 per month with a multiplier of 7, amounting to $126,000.
In the present case, a composite claim of a lump sum of $120,000 was also made by the plaintiffs in respect of ` loss arising out of benefit of pension, gratuity and CPF`. As the claim was of a considerable amount, and I was only referred in the written submission to a passage in the judgment in 
 Parvathy v Liew Yoke Khoon 
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 183
  which was not particularly relevant, I asked all counsel to make further submissions on this claim. In the result, the plaintiffs` counsel referred me in his further submission to the evidence of Ang Swee Loh (PW2) who gave evidence for the Personnel Affairs Department of the Ministry of Defence. He had stated in his evidence that, when a captain retired at the age of 50, his full pension would be $24,101.80 per year. He could also opt for the alternative of a gratuity of $120,590 and a smaller pension of $1,205.09 per month. If he was promoted beyond the rank of captain before retirement, the corresponding amounts would be proportionately higher. At the retirement age of 50, the life expectation of a male Singaporean at that age would be a further 22 years. On CPF, I was referred to the case of Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd v Lim Soon Yong 
 
 [1985] 2 MLJ 267 
 which was followed by me in Lee Wee Hiong & Ors v Victor Koh Ai Sai & Ors 
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 340
 . In Lee Wee Hiong`s case, I merely referred in the context of that case to the fact that any calculation of CPF contributions which had been lost in those circumstances could be a frustrating exercise, and that the court would have to assess a reasonable sum from the given facts, bearing in mind that the dependants would now get accelerated payment. 
I have considered at some length the claims for loss of pension, gratuity and CPF. Claims for loss of pension rights and other post-retirement earnings have been admitted in the past in the case of living injured plaintiffs. In 
 Lai Chi Kay & Ors v Lee Kuo Shin 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 167
  it was not disputed that the plaintiff had suffered this loss, and by consent a formula was adopted which gave the plaintiff the equivalent of two years` pension amounting to HK$46,000 or S$23,000 at the exchange rate then prevailing. In principle, therefore, if a claim can be proved, there appears to be no reason why the estate should not be allowed to claim for loss of pension rights, or why dependants should not also be entitled to claim for any loss of support which they would have derived from a pension, gratuity or other post-retirement income which the deceased would have received, had he not been killed. In Nani v WG Williams 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 68
 , general damages were awarded by the High Court in Penang for loss of pension and for loss of gratuity, but the judgment did not have to deal with the principles on which liability was founded. Although the defendants in that case initially lodged a notice of appeal against the whole of that decision, the appeal proceeded later only on the quantum of damages, and the judgment was therefore confined to that issue. 
The problem for both the court and the parties in dealing with a claim for loss of pension, gratuity and CPF contributions is the practical difficulty of proving the claim and assessing the damages to be awarded. For a claim to succeed, the plaintiff must discharge the burden of proof required, so that at the least the claim will not be considered to be too remote and speculative. It is one thing when an injured plaintiff is living, and the difference can be readily ascertained between the amount of the reduced pension which he is receiving and the amount which he would have been receiving had he not been injured. But it is another thing when the deceased is killed at an early age; the whole claim for loss of future earnings is in the realm of speculation, and any attempt to justify it by making the usual allowances for contingencies and the vicissitudes of life is really an exercise in futility. In 
 Mariayee & Anor v Mohamed Nasir & Anor 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 427
 , in which the facts were not the same, the judgment of the Malaysian Federal Court, in dealing with a claim over the loss in the amount of pension, included the following paragraph: 
 
Now, the deceased was 32 years old when he was killed in 1981 and it would take another 18 years before he reached the optional retiring age of 50. In answer to the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiffs we would like to repeat what Lord Scarman said in the case of 
 Ratnasingam v Kow Ah Dek 
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 297
  at p 301 that learned counsel had ` grossly exaggerated the present capital value of these distant benefits lost as a result of the accident. None of them would have materialized until the deceased had reached the optional retiring age of 55 and there was an element of uncertainty, not only as to the prospect of promotion` but other contingencies in life. In our judgment, having regard to these factors, the trial court would be moving into a world of unreal speculation if it were asked to perform such a difficult task.
 
 
 
In 
 Chan Heng Wah & Anor v Peh Thiam Choh & Anor 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 175
  a claim by the estate of a 20-year old medical student for loss of pension was denied by the High Court. Chua J said at p 179: 
 
 
The first plaintiff also claims for pension and gratuity. In my view it should not be allowed as it is highly speculative and too remote. The deceased might not live to 60 years of age; she might have married, have children and resign from the Service and go into private practice.
 
 
 
Pensions are in fact the creations of statute, and in considering a claim for loss of pension, regard must first be had to the particular statute governing the award or grant of the pension.
In the case of an officer in the Singapore Armed Forces, such as the deceased, his claim to a pension or a gratuity would be governed by the Singapore Armed Forces Act 1972 as amended, and the Singapore Armed Forces Pensions Regulations 1978. Regulations 3 and 4 read as follows: 
 
3 The Armed Forces Council may grant to members of the Singapore Armed Forces and to their dependants or personal representatives pensions, gratuities and other allowances in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations.
 
 
 
4 (1) No member or other person shall have an absolute right to compensation or to any pension, gratuity or other allowance under these Regulations nor shall anything in these Regulations limit the right of the Armed Forces Council to dismiss or to terminate the services of a member without compensation.
 
 
 
 
(2) Where it is established to the satisfaction of the Armed Forces Council that a member has been guilty of negligence, irregularity or misconduct it shall be lawful for the Armed Forces Council to reduce or altogether to withhold or cancel the pension, gratuity or other allowance for which the member would have become eligible but for the provision of this regulation. 
 
(3) The Armed Forces Council may cancel, withhold or reduce a pension, gratuity or other allowance granted to a member if it is established to the satisfaction of the Armed Forces Council that such pension, gratuity or other allowance has been obtained by the wilful suppression of material facts or has been granted in ignorance of facts which, had they been known before the retirement of the member, would have justified a reduction in his emoluments or resulted in his dismissal or discharge from the Singapore Armed Forces. 
 
 (4) Where a pension, gratuity or allowance has been cancelled, withheld or reduced under paras (2) or (3), the Armed Forces Council may at any time, if in any case it considers it equitable to do so, grant or restore the whole pension, gratuity or allowance, or a portion thereof.
  
 
 
On a officer qualifying for a pension by his retirement after the successful completion of his service, it is entirely in the discretion of the Armed Forces Council to grant to him a pension, or gratuity or other allowance. The Council`s powers are very extensive, and the Council may for good cause cancel, withhold or reduce a grant, or subsequently restore it in whole or in part. This being so, there would have been in my opinion no right or entitlement to a pension or gratuity vested in the deceased which would have enabled the personal representatives to base a claim against a tort-feasor either on behalf of the estate or for the benefit of the dependants. A claim to a pension at the age of 50 in respect of a 32-year old lieutenant in the Commandos would simply have been too remote and speculative. It is true that in this case the Council granted a gratuity of $45,000 to the family, a pension to the widow, and allowances to the two children; but these were payments which were made under other provisions in the Regulations which specifically provide for such payments to be made (see reg 30), and cannot affect the position in respect of the deceased` s claim. As there was no acceptable evidence before the court by which any loss of pension or gratuity could be capable of being estimated, I have not made any award under this head.
On the loss of the employer` s CPF contributions, I was referred to 
 Lee Wee Hiong` s case in which I said: 
 
In my view, the principle that the loss attributable to the ce ssation of contributions to the CPF forms part of a dependency claim can no longer be in doubt since the Privy Council decision in 
 Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd v Lim Soon Yong 
 
 [1985] 2 MLJ 267 
, dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal. Any calculation of CPF contributions which have been lost in such circumstances can be a frustrating exercise: even where the initial problem of estimating the future salaries is reduced, as in this case, there have been several significant variations in the rates of the respective contributions even during the period from 1 July 1980 to the date of hearing. Nevertheless it is possible to make a calculation to arrive at an appropriate figure, bearing in mind that what is arrived at is the accelerated receipt of a lump sum which should be discounted.
 
 
 
It is of course for the plaintiffs, as the claimants, to prove the loss of such contributions and their quantum. It is not for the court to take on the primary responsibility of making the calculations which would be necessary to quantify any such loss. In the present case, the claim for the loss of the employers` CPF contributions was in fact lumped into the composite figure of ` $120,000 for pension, gratuity and CPF ` , which appeared to have been submitted more in hope than in conviction. The plaintiffs` bundle in their further submission contained the successive Central Provident Fund (Government Employees) Regulations issued over the years, together with a letter dated 10 September 1990 from the Central Provident Fund Board containing some rather inconclusive calculations on this claim. As it has not been possible in this case for me to arrive at any reliable figures on the evidence before me, I have also refrained from making any award under this head.
Section 9 of the Civil Law Act empowers the court to award interest on damages. In the present case, interest should be calculated at 6% pa on the amounts for loss of expectation of life, and for special damages, from the date of the issue of the writ, 7 September 1983. Interest should be calculated at 3% pa on the amount of damages for pre-trial loss of support from the date of the accident, 17 March 1981.
As the dependants are also the same beneficiaries of the estate, the awards to them as dependants will be reduced in each case by the respective amounts received through the estate as beneficiaries. The special damages should be paid to the widow. For the purpose of complying with s 12(4) of the Civil Law Act, the damages awarded in respect of the dependants` claim should be divided as to two-thirds to the widow and as to one-sixth to each of the two children, for whom the widow rather than the Public Trustee shall hold in trust.
There will also be an order as to the costs of the plaintiffs to be paid by the first and third defendants.

1          This was an appeal against the decision of district judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan. The appellant, Saravanan s/o Ganesan, had claimed trial to a charge of possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or purpose in a public road or place under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65) (‘the Act’). The district judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He appealed against conviction and sentence. After hearing the submissions of counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal against both conviction and sentence. I now give my reasons.
 
The charge
2          The charge against the appellant read:
… that you, on 17
th
 day of February 2002 at or about 3.20 am, outside of Katong Village, along East Coast Road, near Joo Chiat Road, Singapore, which is a public place, did have in your possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife with blade about 15 cm in length, otherwise than for a lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, Chapter 65.
The offence in the charge carries a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment and a minimum sentence of six strokes of the cane.
Background facts
3          The appellant was at a pub in Katong (‘the pub’) on the date of his arrest with his ‘sworn sister’ Pushpa, her husband Suresh who was his ‘sworn brother’, Balakrishnan s/o Srigadan (‘Balakrishnan’) and some others.
4          The pub closed at about 3.00am on 17 February 2002. The Prosecution’s key witness, the manager of the pub, Balraju Ranggersamy (‘Balraju’) left the pub for home. At that time he  saw that a lorry was parked at the pub’s entrance. He later saw this same lorry parked across the road from the pub. Balraju then saw a confrontation between two groups of Indians along Tanjong Katong Road and noticed that some of the customers from the pub were involved. The persons in the two groups were shouting, and moving forward and backward. The appellant admitted later that he and his friends were involved in this confrontation.
5          One of the persons involved in the confrontation was waving a knife at the other group to intimidate them. Balraju called the police at this point and continued to observe the developing situation. 
He did not see anyone else with a weapon nor did he see the knife being passed around
. Although Balraju did not have a good look at the person carrying the knife, he did observe that this person was of medium build and average height. He also observed that this person was wearing a ‘black long-sleeve t-shirt and pants’, and had shoulder length hair. The two groups ran off in different directions when the police arrived at the scene. Balraju did not notice where the person wielding the knife went.
6            National Service Probationary Inspector Andrew Tay Han Meng (‘NSPI Tay’) and Staff Sergeant Roslan Bin Amat (‘Ssgt Roslan’), two of the police officers at the scene, spotted seven Indian subjects including the appellant near the lorry parked across the road from the pub. Passers-by shouted to the police officers that there was a knife on one of the subjects. The police officers proceeded to screen the subjects and conducted a physical check of the lorry. NSPI Tay found a knife (‘the knife’), marked as Exhibit P3 at trial, hidden under a wooden plank in the back of the lorry. Upon questioning at the scene, the lorry driver, Balakrishnan, admitted that the knife belonged to him. NSPI Tay proceeded to arrest him for possession of an offensive weapon.
7          NSPI Tay then instructed Staff Sergeant Affendy Bin Idris to conduct a vehicular identification parade of the seven Indian subjects with the complainant, Balraju. At the vehicular identification parade, Balraju identified the appellant as the person he had seen with the knife by his ‘dark shirt and clothing’. None of the other subjects at the vehicular identification parade were wearing clothing similar to those worn by the appellant. NSPI Tay arrested the appellant. The appellant and Balakrishnan were then escorted back to the police station for investigations.
8          The knife was described by the district judge as a sport knife with a sharp pointed blade measuring 15 cm in length with a molded rubber grip. I agreed fully with the district judge that the knife, being designed for cutting, stabbing or prying, was an ‘offensive weapon’ under s 2 of the Act which defines an ‘offensive weapon’ as ‘any instrument which if used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause hurt’.
9          During police investigations, Balakrishnan retracted his earlier admission that the knife belonged to him. He informed the Investigating Officer (‘IO’) that he had only admitted ownership of the knife on the instructions of the appellant and that the knife did not, in fact, belong to him. The prosecution reviewed the evidence and decided not to take further action against Balakrishnan. Instead, Balakrishnan was called as a witness for the prosecution in relation to the charge against the appellant.
The prosecution’s case
10        The prosecution’s case was that the appellant was the person whom Balraju had seen using the knife to intimidate and threaten the members of the opposing group during the confrontation. This would, if accepted without more, constitute the offence charged under s 6(1) of the Act. An offence under s 6(1) is made out where the accused person is found in possession or in the control of an offensive weapon in any public road or place without lawful authority or purpose. The burden of proving such lawful authority or purpose is upon such person pursuant to s 6(2) of the Act. Therefore, the person seen by Balraju wielding the knife would be, 
prima facie
, an offender under the Act.
11        There were, however, difficulties in the Prosecution’s case. Balraju provided the only useful first-hand account of the events on the date in question for the prosecution. Further, Balraju did not get a good look at the person he saw carrying the knife and had identified the appellant as the offender during the vehicular inspection parade, based only on his attire and hairstyle. Significantly, Balraju could not identify the appellant in court as the offender.
The defence
12        The appellant disputed only one material portion of the charge against him. He claimed a lawful purpose for the possession of the knife – that he had disarmed one ‘Siva’, who by the appellant’s account was the offender seen by Balraju. He had done this in order to prevent injury being caused to the other persons involved in the confrontation. Apart from this, the appellant admitted to all the other elements in the charge. The appellant did not dispute that, on the date of his arrest, he was wearing black clothing and that his hair was of shoulder length. The appellant recounted the following version of events to the court below.
13        The appellant said he was at the pub on 17 February 2002 with Pushpa, Suresh and three other friends. In the pub, the appellant met Balakrishnan and ‘Siva’. ‘Siva’ had approached the appellant and his group for company and the appellant had obliged. During cross-examination, the appellant mentioned for the first time that ‘Siva’ was, like him, wearing a black shirt and had long hair.
14        The appellant and his group decided to go for supper when the pub was closing. Balakrishnan left the pub first with ‘Siva’ to drive the lorry closer to pick them up. The rest of the group made their way out of the pub soon after and the appellant stayed behind for a while to speak to one of the pub’s bouncers. When the appellant rejoined the rest of his group outside the pub, he saw that they were in a heated argument with another group of six or seven Indians. The appellant tried to break up the argument but the other group attacked his group suddenly. There were about 15 people fighting and a few men in the other group were also wearing black shirts.
15        While the group was defending itself, the appellant turned and saw Pushpa restraining ‘Siva’, who was holding something in his hand. The appellant went towards them, fearing for Pushpa’s safety. ‘Siva’ said to him that he was happy to have been accepted into the appellant’s group and could not stand by as they were being attacked. The appellant realised that ‘Siva’ was intoxicated and was holding a knife.
16        The opposing group shouted and taunted ‘Siva’. ‘Siva’, angered, held up the knife, saying ‘Come lah! Come lah!’ The appellant then disarmed ‘Siva’ by twisting his hand and forcefully grabbing the knife somewhere between its blade and handle in order to prevent any injury from occurring. The accused claimed that he was then in a state of shock for a few seconds as he had never held such a weapon before. Following this, Pushpa pulled the appellant across the road towards Balakrishnan’s lorry. Balakrishnan was surprised to see the appellant with the knife and asked the appellant how he had obtained it since the knife belonged to him. The appellant proceeded to follow Balakrishnan’s instructions to hide it under a plank in the back of the lorry.
17        Soon after, a police car arrived and the knife was discovered by NSPI Tay. ‘Siva’, according to the appellant, had disappeared by this time. Balakrishnan was arrested after he admitted to the police that the knife belonged to him. The appellant was then lined up beside the lorry with the rest of the group, and was subsequently also arrested despite his protestations of innocence.
The decision below
18        I was satisfied that the district judge had considered the cases put forward by the prosecution and the defence exhaustively. He was fully aware of the difficulties in the prosecution’s case. At the same time, he rightly held that the burden of proof in relation to the appellant’s defence of lawful possession was upon the appellant. This was clear from the wording of s 6(2) of the Act which provides that in ‘any prosecution for an offence under subsection (1), the onus of proving the existence of a lawful purpose shall lie upon the accused.’
19        At the close of trial, the district judge considered the main issue in contention: whether the appellant did in fact disarm ‘Siva’. This was a question of fact on which two completely different versions arose. After giving consideration to the credibility and consistency of the witnesses for both sides, the district judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution and held that the appellant had failed to discharge the burden on him in relation to his defence of lawful possession. He found that the appellant did not disarm ‘Siva’ and in fact doubted the very existence of such a person. Instead he found that the appellant ‘was armed with the knife, and that he used this to intimidate the other group’. Having made these findings of fact, the district judge was able to convict and sentence the appellant on the charge.
The appeal against conviction
20        The crux of this appeal was essentially whether these findings of fact by the district judge were ‘plainly wrong’ or ‘against the weight of evidence’, since these findings supported the conviction on the charge without more. Counsel for the appellant challenged the findings of fact by the district judge that the appellant was in possession of the knife and that the appellant had not disarmed ‘Siva’. It was also submitted before me that the district judge had ‘completely erred in law in failing to call material witnesses during the trial knowing that the appellant was defending himself in person.’ I found counsel’s challenge against the finding that the appellant was, at some point, in possession of the knife inexplicable as this much was admitted at trial. It was therefore unnecessary for me to address this.
Principles of appellate intervention with findings of fact
21        It is beyond question that an appellate court is reluctant to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact, especially where these findings of fact hinge on an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses at trial. There is a very high threshold to meet before an appellate court will be convinced by an appellant to intervene with such factual findings. The appellant must demonstrate that the contested findings were ‘plainly wrong’ or ‘against the weight of evidence’
.
 This principle has been consistently articulated in the cases: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
, 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
, 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
, 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
, 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 and more recently, 
Shamsul Bin Abdullah v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 176
.
22        The following findings of fact by the district judge therefore stood as 
prima facie
 correct:
(a)        The appellant had intended to confront the other group on the date of his arrest.
(b)       
 
The appellant was on the way to supper in Balakrishnan’s lorry, but had instructed Balakrishnan to make a U-turn in order to confront the other group.
(c)       
 
The appellant had been armed with the knife, and used it to intimidate the other group.
(d)        The appellant hid Exhibit P3 in the lorry, and had instructed Balakrishnan on how to explain it away if the police asked.
These various findings of fact support the two key findings on which the conviction rested: that the appellant did 
not
 disarm a ‘Siva’ and 
therefore
 was the offender seen by Balraju.
Did the appellant disarm ‘Siva’?
23        The question here was simply this: whose version was to be believed? Balraju never saw anybody disarming the offender of the knife or that the knife even changed hands. This stood in stark contrast to the appellant’s account.
Balraju’s testimony
24            Counsel for the appellant sought to impugn the credibility of Balraju as a witness. Counsel submitted that Balraju’s evidence was ‘rigged with doubts’ and that Balraju was ‘in no position to affirm that the culprit was the appellant’ since he did not see the culprit’s face, nor did he see where the culprit went when the police came. I found this contention entirely misconceived. Balraju never professed to having seen where the offender went upon the arrival of the police, nor did he ever testify to seeing this person’s face. His honesty and consistency in this latter respect has, ironically, resulted in the lack of any direct evidence against the appellant but at the same time it has strengthened his credibility as a witness. This Court did not have the advantage of seeing and hearing witnesses at trial. Thus, an appellate court will generally defer to the finding of the trial court that a witness is a witness of truth unless the trial judge was plainly wrong in so finding: 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
. As such, the district judge’s following assessment of Balraju stood:
Their main witness, Balraju, provided a clear and consistent account as to what he saw that night…It is my opinion, after having seen the demeanour of this witness, that Balraju was a credible independent witness of truth. I accept that he did not know the accused, and I found nothing to suggest that he had motive to fabricate his evidence against the accused. He certainly had the opportunity to do so when he was asked whether he could recognise the accused in court. To this, he readily admitted that he could not. He did not seek to bolster or exaggerate his evidence. It is my opinion that Balraju was being completely forthright in his evidence.
Ridzuan’s Testimony
25        In contrast, the district judge found the evidence given by the appellant and his witness, Ridzuan, riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions. The district judge could not accept Ridzuan as a credible witness for the following reasons:
(a)        Ridzuan was not able to provide certain important details – his evidence covered only broadly the main events in sequence.
 (b)            There were inconsistencies between the appellant’s and Ridzuan’s accounts:
 
(i) Ridzuan had testified that the appellant disarmed ‘Siva’ almost immediately after approaching him, while the appellant himself had said that he did so only after five to seven minutes.
 
(ii) Ridzuan’s testimony that there were four or five persons in the appellant’s group contradicted the appellant’s account that there were eight persons in his group.
 
(c)        Even though Ridzuan was supposedly the Chief Security Officer on duty that night, it did not occur to him to inform the police although he thought the fight was ‘serious’.
(d) Ridzuan’s explanation for his presence at the scene, i.e. that he wanted to prevent the troublemakers from returning to the pub, fundamentally undermined his credibility as a witness because the pub had already closed by then.
26        I came to the crucial question of whether the contested findings that the appellant did not disarm ‘Siva’ and 
therefore
 was the offender seen by Balraju were ‘plainly wrong’ or ‘against the weight of evidence’. I was fully aware, as was the district judge below, of the difficulties in the prosecution’s case. Having accepted Balraju’s version of events as the truth, the district judge made the conclusion that the appellant was the offender seen by Balraju. This conclusion was an inference which the appellate court is in as good a position to make as the trial judge: 
Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 439
.
27        I found this inference made by the district judge entirely defensible by reason of the stark 
differences between the accounts from Balraju and the appellant. Having accepted Balraju as a witness of truth, the district judge was entitled to disbelieve the account given by the appellant and his witness, Ridzuan. This conclusion was made rather easier by the fact that there was only one material factual question in issue, i.e. whether the appellant disarmed ‘Siva’. The appellant did not dispute that he had possession of the knife at some point. Further, Balraju had identified the appellant as the offender at the vehicular identification parade while the offender’s distinctive features, i.e. the dark clothes and long shoulder length hair were still fresh in his mind. The appellant had those same exact features on the night of his arrest. The inference drawn by the district judge that the appellant was the offender seen by Balraju wielding the knife was therefore beyond reproach.
28        Further, it was clear to me that the findings of fact of the district judge did not hinge on Balraju’s testimony alone. The following other factors were laid out by him in his grounds of decision.
Balakrishnan’s Testimony
29        The account given by Balakrishnan about the behaviour of the appellant just before and after the incident dovetailed with Balraju’s version of events. The district judge had accepted Balakrishnan as a credible witness despite certain inconsistencies in his testimony at trial and the fact that he had initially admitted ownership of the knife. Again, given that the district judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing Balakrishnan, I accepted this assessment of veracity.
30        I found the following portions of Balakrishnan’s testimony, which were 
unchallenged by the appellant
 during cross-examination to be significant:
(a)        The appellant and his friends had boarded Balakrishnan’s lorry just before the confrontation, and the appellant had asked Balakrishnan to make a U-turn for some ‘unfinished business’.
(b)        The appellant and his friends had alighted from the lorry to confront the other group.
(c) The appellant had instructed Balakrishnan on how to explain to the police the presence of the knife in the lorry.
 
           
31            Balakrishnan’s account showed that the appellant and his friends had intended to confront the other group, implicating the appellant with a state of mind that supported a conviction upon the charge. It also provided more material that stood in contradiction to the testimony of the appellant.
Coincidences and improbabilities in the appellant’s version
32        The district judge found that the appellant’s version of events involved a list of ‘curious coincidences’ which led to real doubt regarding the very existence of ‘Siva’. They were as follows:
(a) The claim that ‘Siva’ was also dressed in black and also had long hair. The district judge rightly found it perplexing that the appellant mentioned these features of ‘Siva’ for the first time only when he was challenged during cross-examination.
(b)        The only person in the appellant’s group who escaped on the date of the incident was ‘Siva’.
(c)        The appellant was unable to offer any assistance in tracing ‘Siva’ and had no further details of ‘Siva’ apart from his first name.
(d)            Attempts by the police to locate ‘Siva’ proved futile.
(e)        Apart from Balakrishnan, all the other persons in the appellant’s group of friends were unavailable at trial to testify on the appellant’s behalf.
33        Further, the district judge found the following aspects of the appellant’s version of events improbable:
(a)        That the appellant had managed to turn and see Pushpa with ‘Siva’ during the sudden attack by the other group even though the situation was ‘messy and chaotic’.
(b)        That the appellant had managed to extricate himself from the melee in order to go and help Pushpa.
(c)        That the appellant had felt fear for Pushpa’s safety when it was clear from the appellant’s own account that ‘Siva’ was not attacking Pushpa. This appeared inconsistent in light of the fact that the other members of his group actually being attacked were in more urgent need of help.
(d)       
 
That the appellant’s hands were uninjured, given that the appellant would have had to hold the sharp blade to forcefully take the knife from ‘Siva’ in order to disarm him.
(e)        That even though the appellant had the courage to disarm a drunk wielding a knife, he was ‘blur’ and ‘shocked’ immediately after taking the knife, and had stood rooted to the ground in a ‘stupor’ holding and staring at the knife for a few seconds.
Failure by the appellant to question Balakrishnan
34        The district judge found it highly suspicious that the appellant had failed to seek confirmation on the existence of ‘Siva’ from Balakrishnan, who was the only member from his group available at trial. This was especially so since the appellant was very conscious of the need to prove the existence of ‘Siva’ for his defence, given that the district judge had explained to the appellant that this burden was upon him.
35        The district judge also found it extremely difficult to understand the appellant’s failure to put his version of events to Balakrishnan when the latter was on the stand. This was especially so given that Balakrishnan’s version of events was in direct contradiction to the appellant’s own version and inculpated the appellant with the intention to confront the other group.
36        The district judge could not accept that these omissions on the part of the appellant were due to ignorance. The appellant had represented himself competently at trial and was, according to the district judge, ‘not a simpleton’. The district judge justifiably concluded that the appellant did not want to risk an outright denial from Balakrishnan that would have weakened his case further.
Findings of fact to be left undisturbed
37        In light of the foregoing, I was satisfied that the district judge was justified in preferring the prosecution’s account on the evidence before him and in finding that the appellant did not disarm ‘Siva’ of the knife and was, indeed, the offender. The appellant had fallen far short from demonstrating that the district judge’s findings of fact were ‘plainly wrong’ or ‘against the weight of evidence’ such that this Court may interfere with them.
Did the district judge wrongly fail to call material witnesses?
38            Counsel also submitted before me that the district judge had ‘completely erred in law in failing to call material witnesses during the trial knowing that the appellant was defending himself in person’. Counsel further submitted that the district judge ‘should have directed the prosecution to produce these material witnesses’ at the scene, namely Pushpa and Suresh. I found these submissions utterly without merit.
39            Counsel drew my attention to s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC’) in his written submissions. Section 399 of the CPC reads:
Any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceedings under this Code, summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned, as a witness or recall and re-examine any person already examined and the court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person, if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.
In 
Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 3 SLR 276
 at 284, I held that there were two limbs in s 399 of the CPC – the discretionary and the mandatory. In the discretionary limb, the court 
may
 recall or summon witnesses in order to reach a just decision on the case. In the mandatory limb, where it is ‘essential to the just decision of the case’, the court 
shall
 summon and examine any person as a witness. The question here was whether it could be said that the calling of Pushpa and Suresh was essential to the just decision of the case, given the difficulties present in the prosecution’s case. I answered this question in the negative.
40        In 
Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor
 I held also that what was essential to the just decision of the case could not be defined categorically, but that the question could be clarified by asking whether a conviction in the absence of such evidence would be safe, or that an acquittal in such circumstances would amount to an injustice. Having satisfied myself that the district judge had sufficient and justifiable reasons to reach the findings of fact which supported a conviction upon the charge brought against the appellant, I was able to find that the production of Pushpa and Suresh as witnesses was not essential for a just decision of the case. The curious coincidences and inherent improbabilities apparent from the appellant’s version of events would still have existed even if other witnesses for the defendant were called at trial.
41        It was therefore the discretionary limb of s 399 of the CPC that is applicable here. In 
Sim Cheng Hui v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 2 SLR 302
 the Court of Appeal held that the discretionary power conferred upon a court to recall or summon witnesses should be exercised sparingly and judiciously to reach the just decision on the case. Indeed, utmost circumspection in the exercise of this power is imperative where there is likelihood of fresh evidence prejudicial to the accused arising (see 
PP v Phon Nam
 
[1998] 3 MLJ 415
 and 
Ramli bin Kechik v PP
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 33
, on the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code equivalent of s 425). However, judicial circumspection here does not exist exclusively for the benefit of the accused. As articulated in 
Ramli bin Kechik
, a section such as s 399 of the CPC is as much about the prevention of escape of a guilty person through some carelessness of the prosecution or the trial judge as the vindication of the innocence of the person wrongly accused. A ‘just decision’ under this section does not necessarily have to be a decision in favour of the defence. 
42        It is pertinent at this point to state, as I did in 
Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v PP
, that generally no attack may be made on the failure of a court to call a witness notwithstanding that the judge may not have actually considered s 399 of the CPC in his decision. Any failure to call a witness would only be material where the mandatory exercise of the power pursuant to s 399 is in question. This was not the case at hand and the district judge could not be faulted as counsel had suggested.
43        The district judge had rightly held that s 6(2) of the Act placed the duty squarely upon the appellant to prove the existence of a lawful purpose to avoid a conviction under s 6(1) of the Act. Section 107 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (‘EA’) further provides that the legal burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case ‘within any special exception or proviso contained…in any law defining the offence’ is placed upon the appellant, failing which ‘the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances’. It was therefore clearly neither for the court nor the prosecution to call witnesses to adduce factual evidence on behalf of the appellant to support his defence.
44        There are, further, strong reasons in principle for an emphatic rejection of counsel’s argument that the district judge had a duty to effectively assist the defence by ordering the production of material witnesses in these circumstances. First, doing so would conflict with the statutory allocation of the burden of proof pursuant to s 6(2) of the Act and s 107 of the EA. Second, and more importantly, imposing such a duty upon the judge in these circumstances would be untenable and strike at the very root of the independence of the trial judge as an impartial and independent adjudicator. The onus of proof imposed by statute here does not shift to the judge, or the prosecution for that matter, simply because the accused was unrepresented.  It is not for the judge to play the role of defence counsel. This was the basis for my decisions in 
Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 815
 and 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
, where I rejected similar arguments that the trial judge had some form of duty to inform the unrepresented defendant of possible defence strategies. It bears repeating that a just decision in a criminal trial is not necessarily one in favour of the accused person.
  45       Be that as it may, I found that the district judge had been more than accommodating towards the appellant, which must be in no small part due to the fact that he was unrepresented at trial, counsel having discharged himself. Prior to that, the appellant had approximately a year between his arrest and trial to prepare his defence with his lawyer. Nevertheless, the district judge had taken pains to impress upon the appellant the necessity for him to produce Pushpa and other material witnesses right from the start of trial. The appellant understood this, given his production of Ridzuan as a witness. After the defence was called and again at the end of the trial, the district judge gave the appellant further opportunities to produce Pushpa and his other witnesses. The appellant, unfortunately, did not do so.
Appeal against conviction dismissed
46        The undisturbed findings by the district judge sufficiently constituted the offence, by the appellant, of being in possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or purpose pursuant to section 6(1) of the Act.
47        As explained above, I was satisfied that the appellant was the offender and accordingly dismissed the appeal against conviction.
Appeal against sentence
48        The appellant was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane by the district judge. On behalf of the appellant, counsel pleaded the fact that the appellant had subsequently hidden the offending weapon the knife in Balakrishnan’s lorry. I found this completely unhelpful. The fact that this was done does not change the fact that the appellant was in possession of the weapon, nor does it provide him with any lawful authority or excuse.
49            Counsel also pleaded, on behalf of the appellant, the hardship that would result to the appellant’s family because of his sentence and the fact that he had no previous convictions. I rejected both arguments without hesitation. I was unable to accept hardship upon the appellant’s family as a mitigating factor to warrant a reduction in his sentence. I have consistently held that hardship upon an offender’s family occurs inevitably as a consequence of his own criminal conduct, and carries little mitigating value save in very exceptional or extreme circumstances: 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
 and 
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
. I did not find the appellant’s circumstances either exceptional or extreme.
50        I was also satisfied that the sentence imposed by the district judge was in line with the sentencing benchmarks for the offence, and that the fact that the appellant had no previous convictions had already been taken into account. The usual sentence for a first offender who pleads guilty to the offence charged is six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane where the weapon is a knife. Given the circumstances of the offence and the overriding need to protect the public from the potential danger arising from the possession of such weapons in public places, I found the sentence meted by the district judge entirely proportionate and dismissed the appeal against sentence.

1            ABC, a 24-year-old male Singaporean,  a private security guard by occupation,  was charged for four offences, two counts of aggravated rape, one of outraging modesty in aggravated circumstances  and one of theft. All of them were said to be committed in the early hours of  28 February 2003, in a residential apartment block in Singapore. The victim was a Filipino national, residing at the material time in one of the apartments in the said apartment block.
 
2          The charges preferred against the accused, insofar as they are material, with the omission of the name of the victim, read as follows:

3          The accused who was unrepresented, pleaded guilty to all four charges. He was, through a court interpreter in Tamil, advised of the consequences of his plea, including the range of sentence(s) for the charges he was facing and the effect of Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code which prescribes that where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted shall order that the sentences for at least two of the offences shall run consecutively. The accused informed the court that he was aware of the consequences of his plea.
Facts
4          The facts pertaining to the four charges as read out by the prosecution and admitted by the accused  are as follows:
5          The victim is a Philippines national bearing FIN No. .............. At the time of the offences she was residing at  ...... . She is working as an underwriter with .....................Company.
Arrest of the accused
6          On 28 February 2003 at about 5.13am, the victim called the police for assistance to ascertain if the man who had broken into her apartment was still there. She reported that the man, who was the security guard at her condominium, had climbed into her apartment from the balcony and tried to rape her while she was sleeping in her bedroom. The police arrived shortly and found the accused sleeping on the victim’s bed, whereupon they immediately placed him under arrest.
7            Investigations revealed that the victim had come to Singapore to work sometime in May 2002. She moved into QW about a month after and lived there alone.
8          The accused started to work as a security guard at QW on 13 January 2003. Although the victim did not know him personally, she used to greet him whenever she saw him at the guardhouse.
9          On 27 February 2003, the victim walked home alone from Novena MRT station at about 11pm. When she walked past the main gate of QW, she did not see any security guard in the guardhouse, but did not think anything of this as the security guard on duty usually works until 10pm only.
10        After taking a lift to her apartment on the second floor, the victim showered, packed her suitcase as she had planned to return to the Philippines the following day and then went to sleep after locking the main door, through which human entrance or departure from her apartment is effected. As always, she left the door leading to the service balcony closed but unlocked, erroneously believing that nobody would enter her apartment through this door as it was almost 4 metres above the ground, especially in Singapore, a country reputed to be safe.
Housebreaking and theft by night
11            Investigations revealed that in the early hours of the morning of 28 February 2003, the accused had placed a black rubbish bin below the rubbish chute of Block A where the victim lived, climbed on top of the step above the chute, reached out to grab the metal railing of the service balcony to the victim’s apartment and climbed over the said railing onto the balcony, and entered the victim’s apartment through the door leading to the service balcony. Upon entering the apartment, the accused saw $110 placed under a coaster on the table in the living room and promptly pocketed this money.
First aggravated rape
12        After the accused pocketed the money, he heard a noise coming from the victim’s bedroom. He then grabbed a wooden stool, entered her bedroom and used the stool to hit her on the head. The victim awoke, but could not recognise the accused because it was dark. The accused then dragged the victim off her bed onto the floor and used his body to pin her down. The victim screamed and struggled against the accused. The accused then used his hand to cover the victim’s mouth, and told her not to scream and resist him or he would kill her. Fearing for her life, the victim complied with the accused’s instructions.
13        The accused then told the victim that he loved her and wanted to have sex with her. He then told her to take off her panty. When she refused, he leaned on her and pulled off her panty. He then inserted his penis into her vagina. Terrified of the accused, the victim did not dare to struggle or resist but merely kept crying as he continued to thrust his penis in and out of her vagina.
Second aggravated rape
14        After some time, the accused then withdrew his penis and told the victim to lie on her bed. When she refused, he used vulgarities on her and again threatened to hurt or kill her if she did not follow his instructions. The accused then got up and pulled her onto the bed by her hand. He then lay on top of her and told her to remove her nightgown. When she kept crying, he threatened to kill her unless she stopped crying and complied with his instructions. Out of fear, she took off her nightgown. The accused then inserted his penis into her vagina again and continued to thrust his penis in and out of the victim’s vagina. The victim did not dare to put up a struggle as she was afraid he might carry out his threat and harm, or kill her.
Aggravated outrage of modesty
15        After the accused withdrew his penis, he told the victim that he wanted to lick her as he loved her very much. He then promptly licked the victim’s vagina. The victim did not dare to put up a struggle as the accused’s threats to kill or hurt her still operated on her mind.
16            Thereafter, the accused also kissed her on her mouth and touched her all over her body. He again told her that he loved her, and asked her if she could ever love him. She replied that she first needed to know who he was. He then revealed that he was the security guard of QW. At that point, the victim suddenly recognised the accused and realised that he was telling the truth. He also told her that his name was ‘Troy’.
17        At this point, the victim complained that her head was very painful and she asked if she could go to the kitchen to get ice. The accused went with her. She then put the ice in a towel and placed it on her forehead. When they returned to her bedroom, the accused told her to lie down on her bed. He then asked if she wanted to see his face. When she said yes, he switched on the light. The victim saw that he was indeed the security guard of QW. He then switched off the light and went to lie beside her. He told her that if she dared to call the police, he would kill her, which would be easy as he had many friends and knew where she lived. He then made her swear that she would not call the police.
18        He then asked her to get him some water. She told him to get it himself as she had a very bad headache. When the accused returned from the kitchen, the victim pretended to be asleep. He lay down beside her and put his arm across her body. After she ascertained that he had fallen into a deep sleep, she got out of bed quietly, put on her nightgown and went into the living room, intending to escape. Whilst waiting in the living room, she noticed that the $110 she had left on the table in the living room was missing. She then ran out of her apartment to her neighbour’s apartment on the 9
th
 floor and told him what had happened. Her neighbour, a male Italian national then called the police. Feeling ‘dirty’ after having been raped, the victim took a shower whilst at her neighbour’s apartment and threw her nightgown into the rubbish bin. The police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested the accused who was found sleeping in the victim’s apartment. The $110 was subsequently recovered from the right front pocket of the accused’s pants.
Medical examination of the victim
19        The victim was examined at the K K Women’s & Children’s Hospital on 28 February 2003 at about 8.55am. She was found to have numerous bruises all over her body, on her chest, hip, knee cap and left thigh. There was also a swelling on her left forehead.
20        On 19 March 2003, the victim was also examined at the Department of Sexually-Transmitted Diseases Control (DSC) Clinic. She had complained of vaginal discharge and pain on passing urine for a week, and was found to be suffering from gonorrhoea infection of the uterine cervix.
Sentence
21        In the event, the accused was convicted of all four charges. He also admitted that he had a record of previous convictions. The memorandum submitted by the prosecution revealed that he had committed a series of offences involving robbery, theft and false personation of another person during the time he was undergoing a period of probation.
22        In mitigation, the accused said that he was thoroughly remorseful and that he committed those offences at the time when he was totally inebriated. He pleaded the court for leniency suggesting that a long custodial sentence would cause great hardship to the support level of his father who is presently paralysed.
23        The prosecution, on the other hand, urged the court to impose a deterrent sentence, bearing in mind that the offender is a security guard who instead of protecting life and property had gone about abusing the very trust placed in him.
24        In my view, the offences committed by the accused could not be treated lightly. It appeared to me that he did not seem to have learnt anything from his past infractions of the law and the opportunities afforded to him previously, namely the previous probation order and the subsequent stint at the rehabilitative training centre. The violence he had committed presently on the hapless female victim and the manner in which he had conducted himself towards the victim in the early hours of 28 February 2003, appeared to evince a pattern of behaviour which required a fitting sentence. No doubt, I took into consideration that he pleaded guilty at the outset and thereby saved the victim having to revisit the agony and trauma she had suffered in the hands of the accused in March this year.
25        Having considered all the facts, including all those said by the accused in his mitigation and bearing in mind the broad principles articulated by the Singapore Court of Appeal in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
, I imposed the following sentences:
On the first charge marked A1, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 12 strokes of the cane;
On the third charge marked A3, a sentence of imprisonment of  8 years and 12 strokes of the cane;
On the second charge marked A2, a sentence of imprisonment of 4 years; (As regards the mandatory caning requirement as prescribed under section 458A of the Penal Code in relation to the charge at hand, the accused having already been ordered to receive a total of 24 strokes, no further caning can be ordered in view of the  provisions of s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences any two or more of which are legally punishable by caning the combined sentence of caning awarded by the court for any such offences shall not, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding, exceed a total number of 24 strokes in the case of adults or 10 strokes in the case of youthful offenders); and
On the fourth charge marked A4, a sentence of  imprisonment of 2 years; (no further caning to be imposed in view of the provisions of section 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code).
26            Pursuant to s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the sentences as regards the first and third charges to run consecutively and the rest of the sentences are to run concurrently. The sentences are to be back-dated to the date of arrest of the accused, ie, 28 February 2003.",2003-11-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

The charge
 
1          The accused pleaded guilty before me to the following amended charge (DAC 46346/03):
You, Andasamy Alagurasamy, M/61 yrs old, NRIC No: S1163064B, DOB: 15/10/1941, are charged that you on the 29
th
 day of November 2002, at around or about 2.30 am, at Block 106 Clementi Street 12, outside of unit #01-56 Singapore, did commit theft of three brass urns which [are] valued at S$230/- (Two Hundred and Thirty Singapore Dollars), in the possession of Low Chin Huat, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2          The accused admitted the statement of facts without qualification.  The victim, Low Chin Huat (‘Mr Low’) owns a restaurant at Block 107 Clementi Street 12 known as ‘Chin Huat Eating House’.  Investigations revealed that on 29 November 2002, the accused had gone to Mr Low’s restaurant in the early hours of the morning.  He intended to steal three brass urns which were placed outside the said restaurant.  The accused brought along a trolley to transport the three urns.
3           Fortunately for Mr Low, the owner of a neighbouring Chinese medicine shop known as ‘Shan Dong’ had installed a close-circuit television (‘CCTV’) camera outside his shop for security.  The CCTV recording showed the accused using his trolley to cart away the three brass urns at about 2.30 am.  Apparently, he had taken the urns for the purpose of offering prayers to the gods.  After his prayers, he left the urns unattended along Clementi Avenue 4.  The urns could not be traced subsequently.  The day after, the accused was spotted along Clementi Street 12 by the complainant, one Tan Nhiap Seng (‘Mr Tan’), who recognised him from the CCTV recording as the person who had taken the urns.  Mr Tan proceeded to call the police.
4          A second similar charge of theft (DAC 46347/03) was admitted by the accused and taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  It transpired that the trolley used by the accused to transport the three brass urns was also stolen on 29 November 2002, at about 12.20 am.  He had taken the trolley, valued at $40/-, from Block 106 Clementi Street 12, outside #01-56.
Antecedents and mitigation
5          The accused admitted that he had 33 previous convictions.  It should be noted however that the copy of the antecedent report (CRO60) tendered by the prosecution did not list his convictions in proper chronological order.  His prodigious criminal record dates back to June 1966, when he was sentenced to 1 week imprisonment for possession of an offensive weapon.  Thereafter, he progressed to committing other offences of varying degrees of gravity, from being habitually drunk and incapable (nine related convictions) to more serious crimes such as robbery and rape.
6          Of particular note were his sixteen previous convictions under s 379 (10 counts) and s 380 (6 counts) of the Penal Code.  His last conviction (in March 1998) for an offence under s 380 resulted in a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment.  More recently, in June 2003, he was again convicted on a charge of being drunk and incapable. He was sentenced by a magistrate’s court to 2 months’ imprisonment.
7          In mitigation, the accused informed me that he had sustained a fracture and had been hospitalised for 4 weeks.  He also had a weak heart and lungs.  He was very sorry for what he had done.   He was already quite old.  He was willing to make restitution for the value of the urns as his salary of $850/- was due from his employer.  He promised never to commit any other offence.
Reasons for sentence
8          From a perusal of the CRO60, it appeared that the accused has been awarded a whole spectrum of imprisonment terms for his previous similar or related property offences under s 379 or s 380, ranging from 1 day imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 in 1981 to 6 years’ imprisonment in 1998.  Curiously, at no point over the last 20-odd years was he apparently considered to be a potential candidate for corrective training or preventive detention, despite being amply qualified for both sentences.
9          There was no mitigating value in his plea of guilt as he was caught in the act on the CCTV recording.  He committed the present offence shortly after his release from six years’ imprisonment for a related property offence under s 380.  Six years is of course a substantial period of time.  But perhaps the previous period of incarceration was somehow still not substantial enough to effectively deter him from further crime.  Evidently, upon his release from imprisonment, he had simply drifted back to his old ways of alcoholism and pilfering.
10        I had little doubt that preventive detention was the only viable option, for which the starting point would be seven years.  Even if he was ultimately not going to be reformed or deterred, a long-term sentence would at least serve the more important basic purpose of preventing further crime by incapacitating him for a lengthy period.  Hence I called for a pre-sentence report to determine his suitability for preventive detention, bearing in mind his complaints of poor health and weak constitution.
The pre-sentence report
11        The pre-sentence report for preventive detention (‘the PD report’) confirmed that he was mentally and physically fit to undergo preventive detention.  In the PD report, the prisons psychologist had assessed the accused’s general risk of recidivism as being in the ‘medium to high risk’ category, with a 54% chance of recidivism within a year or release.  In my view, this assessment was entirely consistent with his pattern of offending.
12        When interviewed by the psychologist, the accused attributed his offending behaviour to alcohol consumption but denied being an alcoholic (see Part Seven – Risk Findings at page 4 of the PD report).  This flew in the face of his admission at page 3 of the PD report that he was addicted to Chinese wine which he consumed daily.  Moreover, he claimed that he did not intend to steal the trolley or the urns, and had planned to return the urns the next morning. 
13        By this claim, the accused could be seen as having qualified his earlier plea of guilt and admission of the statement of facts.  Had he raised this in his mitigation plea earlier, I might have had to consider whether to reject his plea of guilt on the ground that he was disputing that he had the necessary mens rea for the offence.  Nevertheless, it was clear to me that his plea of guilt was voluntary and unequivocal.  He had not mentioned any matters before me which could qualify his plea.  As such, I was not troubled by his new assertions.  Plainly, he had raised them only in an effort to diminish his culpability for the present offence, upon realising that he could be facing preventive detention.
14        In any event, even accepting what the accused had raised, he would still have committed an offence of theft as he had removed the urns and the trolley without permission from the owners, thereby causing them wrongful loss.  It made no difference that he may have only intended to use the items temporarily for his prayers.  Obviously, as the investigations revealed, he did not return the items at all, contrary to what he claimed he had intended to do.  Instead, he had simply abandoned them along Clementi Avenue 4.   I saw no difficulty therefore in allowing his plea of guilt to remain.  In any case, he made no effort before me to retract his plea of guilt.
15        I should add that despite assessing the accused to be of ‘medium to high risk’ in terms of recidivism, with respect, the psychologist nonetheless arrived quite inexplicably at a surprising conclusion at Part Eight (page 4) of the PD report.  It was noted that the accused had expressed remorse over his actions and was still able to find jobs to support himself despite his age.  Thus, the psychologist concluded that ‘in view of these factors and his current frail condition, a long deterrent sentence may not be warranted’. 
16            However frail the accused may have appeared during the interview with the psychologist, he had undergone a medical examination before the prisons medical officer and he was duly certified to be mentally and physically fit to undergo preventive detention.   The psychologist herself had noted that the accused had ‘drifted along life aimlessly with little insight into his alcohol addiction and offending cycle’ and had a displayed a tendency to attribute his offences to alcohol addiction, reflecting his ‘lack of personal control and deflection of accountability’.   These considerations would clearly indicate a strong likelihood of continued recidivism.  This was amply supported by his LSI-R assessment of having a 54% chance of recidivism within a year of release.  Curiously, the psychologist concluded nonetheless that ‘a long deterrent sentence may not be warranted’ on account of his ostensible expression of remorse, his self-sufficiency and his perceived ‘current frail condition’.
17        I did not see why the accused should be given any credit for expressing remorse, since he was literally caught in the act on the CCTV recording.  An expression of remorse would carry hardly any weight in view of his inexhaustible criminal proclivities.   With 33 previous convictions in his CRO60, he was eminently suitable for preventive detention.   He was also found to be mentally and physically suitable to undergo preventive detention.   These are essentially all that s 12(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) requires the court to consider.  I was satisfied that keeping him in preventive detention for a substantial period of time would be expedient for the protection of the public.
18        I should also add that the PD report contains an error at Part Four (page 2) where it was stated that the accused had been first imprisoned at age 30 for offences of rape and robbery.  In fact, as the CRO60 reveals, he was first incarcerated in 1966 when he was 25 years old.  It is not clear why this mistake was made despite the psychologist having had access to all the relevant documents, including the CRO60.
19        There is no mandatory requirement for the court to call for a pre-sentence report: see 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
; 
PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
.  The PD report is only obtained as a matter of practice, for the basic purpose of assisting the court in ensuring the physical and mental suitability of the offender to undergo long-term incarceration: see 
Kua Hoon Chua’s
 case.  Ultimately, the court has to determine the appropriate sentence for each offender, having regard in every case to what is expedient in the public interest. 
20        In the circumstances, it was regrettable that the psychologist had ventured an unsolicited and unmeritorious submission on sentence to the effect that ‘a long deterrent sentence may not be warranted’.  The discretion to determine the appropriate type and length of sentence is vested solely in the courts.  Our sentencing policies towards recidivists have always been clear and consistent.  The principles are well-settled in cases such as 
PP v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid
 
[2002] 4 SLR 154
; 
PP v Perumal Suppiah
 
[2000] 3 SLR 308
; 
Tan Ngin Hai v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 161
.  The primary objective in dealing with recidivists is deterrence.  Incapacitation goes hand in hand with long-term deterrent sentences.  There was no reason in this case to make an exception.
21        This was the accused’s 34
th
 conviction over a period of 37 years.  There was every risk that he would reoffend upon his release.  Thus I sentenced him to nine years’ preventive detention.  He would therefore be incarcerated for a period far in excess of the maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment permitted for the offence of theft.  In my opinion, this was the only appropriate course in the present case.  I understand that the accused filed a notice of appeal on 12 November 2003.  He is presently serving sentence.",2003-11-15 00:00:00,SG District Court

Background
 
1          On 10 October 2003, the accused was scheduled to plead guilty before me to the following amended charge (DAC 33048/03):
You, Lim Beng Yee, Male/38 years old, NRIC No: S1660972B, (DOB: 13/09/1964), are charged that you, on the 24
th
 June 2003 at about 9.50 am, at the vicinity of Block 401 Hougang Avenue 10, Singapore, did cheat one Ang Ronghui Louis, to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you needed $800/- in order to use it for medical treatment, when that was not true and in actual fact, the money was used for gambling, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Ang Ronghui Louis to deliver to you a sum of $800/-, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
2          As the accused had indicated at an earlier pre-trial conference that he would be pleading guilty, the prosecution offered not to proceed with two other charges of cheating, but to apply to have them taken into consideration.  However, on 10 October 2003, before his plea was taken, the accused changed his mind about pleading guilty to the charge.  He maintained that he did not cheat the victim, Mr Ang Ronghui Louis ('Mr Ang'), and that he had only borrowed money from Mr Ang.  As such, I scheduled the trial to be heard before me two weeks thereafter, over two days from 30 to 31 October 2003.
3          On 30 October 2003, the accused confirmed that he was accepting the prosecution's standing offer to proceed only with DAC 33048/03 provided he was prepared to plead guilty to that charge.  The charge was duly read to him in English.  He pleaded guilty unreservedly to the charge and admitted the statement of facts without any qualification.  Accordingly, he was found guilty and convicted on his plea of guilt.
The statement of facts
4            According to the statement of facts, Mr Ang was at City Hall MRT station on 20 June 2003 at about 6.30 pm to meet his friend.  When Mr Ang alighted from the train, the accused approached him and introduced himself as 'Michael'.  The accused told Mr Ang that he was in financial difficulty and needed help.  He had just been released from prison and could not find a job.  They started to chat and the accused showed Mr Ang his NRIC and a letter of release from prison.  Mr Ang felt pity for the accused.  Later, both Mr Ang and the accused exchanged telephone numbers.
5          On 24 June 2003, the accused called up Mr Ang to arrange a meeting.  When they met that morning at about 9.50 am, the accused told him that he had a spinal problem and needed $800/- for medical treatment.  Believing that the accused needed immediate medical attention, Mr Ang handed him $800/-.  Investigations revealed that the accused spent the $800/- to sustain his gambling habits and on his daily expenses.  He had thus cheated Mr Ang by dishonestly inducing him into believing that the money was to be used for medical treatment.  To date, the accused had not made any restitution.
6          Two other similar charges of cheating (DAC 33047/03 and DAC 47423/03) were admitted by the accused and taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  It transpired that he had deceived Mr Ang into parting with $500/- on an earlier occasion, on 20 June 2003.  He had also adopted the same ruse to cheat another victim, one Tow Chew Choy, of $600/- on 23 June 2003.
Antecedents and mitigation
7          The accused admitted to a total of 16 previous convictions.  His first brush with the law occurred in 1984, when he was convicted for an offence of criminal breach of trust and fined $2,000.  He went on to accumulate another 15 convictions between 1991 and 2003, committing a wide variety of offences of varying degrees of gravity. 
8          Among his previous convictions, the offences included the following.  In 1991 and 1992, he was convicted for offences of theft in dwelling (s 380 Cap 224).  In 1992, he was also convicted on one count of gaming in a common gaming house (s 7 Cap 49).  In 1994, he was convicted on one count of possessing a house-breaking implement or offensive weapon (s 27(f) [now s 22(1)] Cap 184) as well as one count of mischief (s 427 Cap 224). 
9          In 1996, he was convicted on three separate occasions for the following five offences:
a. One count of doing an obscene act in a public place (s 294(a) Cap 224)
b. One count of wilful trespass on property (s 21 Cap 184)
c. Two counts of cheating (s 420 Cap 224)
d. One count of possession of an offensive weapon (s 22(1)(a) Cap 184)
10        Shortly after his release from imprisonment in 1997, he was again convicted on another count of disorderly behaviour (s 20 Cap 184).  In 1999, he was convicted a second time for doing an obscene act in a public place (s 294(a) Cap 224).   A year later, in 2000, he was convicted again on two counts of cheating (s 420 Cap 224).  His most recent conviction was in March 2003, for a third offence of doing an obscene act in public (s 294 Cap 224).  
11        From his criminal record, the accused was clearly unappreciative of the leniency previously extended to him by the courts.  He had enjoyed relatively brief stints of imprisonment for all his previous offences.  But his extensive criminal record spoke volumes; he was a persistent offender who reoffended with impunity.  In particular, I was concerned with his progressive affinity for cheating offences.  This would be his fifth such conviction, along with five similar counts taken into consideration.
12        In mitigation, the accused pleaded for leniency and asked for forgiveness.  I was conscious that at a pre-trial conference which I conducted on 7 October 2003, the accused had extended copies of his cautioned statements to the charges for my reference.  This was ostensibly for the purpose of mitigation in anticipation of his plea of guilt and conviction on 10 October 2003.  However, as I have mentioned earlier, the accused changed his mind about pleading guilty on 10 October 2003.  Subsequently, on 30 October 2003, no further reference was made to the cautioned statements when the accused was invited to mitigate his sentence.  As such, for present purposes, I do not consider it necessary to make any further reference to the cautioned statements as well.
Reasons for sentence
13        The prosecutor observed that from a perusal of the accused's antecedent report (CRO60), he would qualify for corrective training or preventive detention.  I called for a pre-sentence report for corrective training only to determine his suitability to undergo such a sentence, and sentencing was thus adjourned to 18 November 2003.  However, on 18 November, I was informed that the accused was unfit to attend court. Apparently, he was required to undergo psychiatric treatment for signs of psychosis while in remand.  Hence I directed a further adjournment to 3 December 2003.
14        The corrective training report ('CT report') was eventually tendered on 3 December 2003.  He was certified to be physically and mentally fit to undergo corrective training.  More importantly, he was assessed to fall within the 'high risk' category of offenders, with a 66% chance of reoffending within one year of his release (page 3 of the CT report).  After all, he had committed the present offence within a few short weeks after his release from a three-month term of imprisonment.  Previous terms of incarceration had not made any real impact in terms of deterring him from further crime.
15        The following observations noted by the prisons counsellor in the CT report were also pertinent.  At Part Five (page 2) of the CT report, the accused was observed to have been 'talkative and unfocused', and had 'often side-tracked to talk about other things during the interview'.  He 'tended to be emotionally charged when recounting his experiences, and would raise his voice or stand up from his seat'.  At Part Seven (page 3), the counsellor noted that he 'tried to minimise his criminal intent by claiming that he did not intend to cheat the victim, but was merely borrowing the sum of money from him'.
16        I shall recite the counsellor's evaluation of the accused's 'specific risks of offending' (Part Seven, page 3) in full as this was entirely consistent with my own assessment:
He also appeared to be unfavourable towards convention.  During the interview, subject was self-opinionated and shared strong views about systemic flaws of social institutions.  For example, he reportedly was unhappy about halfway houses' policy of charging $100 for accommodation, when these are supposedly 'welfare homes'.
He was also giving opinions about how some prisons policies need to be amended.  On another instance, he reportedly felt that it is unfair to punish people by incarceration, as everybody makes mistakes.  He also reportedly felt that prisoners are brave and honourable people, who work hard in prisons and showed one another brotherly love.
His lifestyle was also evidently poor towards convention.
He was apparently engaged in self-victimisation as well, as he reportedly shared how he was unjustly treated on several occasions.
Therefore, subject's pattern of law violations seemed to be largely due to his unconventional and criminal thinking, as well as his tendency to minimise his criminal intent.
17        Given the above evaluation, I was not confident that the accused's propensity towards crime would necessarily be arrested by a long-term sentence.  He was singularly unremorseful about his conduct.  This was evident from his attempt to qualify his plea of guilt by suggesting that he was merely borrowing money from Mr Ang without intending to cheat him.  All too often attempts to qualify or retract guilty pleas are made out of sheer desperation during pre-sentence interviews, and only when accused persons come to realise that they may be facing extended terms of incarceration as repeat offenders.  There may well be exceptional cases where the circumstances justify further inquiry to determine whether the plea of guilt should be permitted to stand.  I did not think this was such a case.
18        When given the opportunity to mitigate on 30 October 2003, the accused had raised no such allegations.  It will be recalled that the accused himself had initially elected not to plead guilty to the charge on 10 October 2003, citing the very same reasons mentioned to the counsellor.  For reasons best known to himself, he subsequently chose to plead guilty on 30 October 2003.  His plea of guilt was voluntary, unambiguous and unequivocal.  Nothing was mentioned before me which could amount to a qualification of his plea.  Hence, I was not troubled by his assertions to the counsellor.  Indeed, the only useful inferences I could draw were that he was completely unremorseful and merely vacillating in an attempt to manipulate the court process to suit his needs (or whims).  I would not countenance such a flagrant abuse of process.
19        In my view, the accused was almost certain to reoffend upon release from custody.  He had minimal protective factors.  He had no fixed residence, no family support and no capacity or inclination to find gainful means of employment.  Frequent but brief spells of imprisonment had apparently only served to embolden him and entrench his 'unconventional and criminal thinking'.  Even if he was ultimately not going to be reformed or deterred, a long-term sentence was necessary to prevent further crime by incapacitating him for a suitably prolonged duration.  I therefore sentenced him to seven years' corrective training.  After I had passed sentence, the accused asked to be allowed to mitigate further.  I declined his request as sentence had already been passed.
Request to further mitigate
20        The court is not duty-bound to invite an accused to mitigate: see 
Ng Ai Tiong v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 358
 (at ¶16).  Analogously, it was held in 
Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 815
 (at ¶22) that 'it is not the duty of the judge to inform the accused of the defences or other options that may be open to him and advantageous to his case'.  It was further noted in 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
 (at ¶7) that the court is under no duty 'to educate the accused of the manifold factors that play a part in the exercise of sentencing discretion'. 
21        I reminded the accused that he had already spoken up in mitigation of his sentence earlier on 30 October 2003, when he pleaded guilty to the charge.  He  had not been deprived of an opportunity to mitigate.  All the necessary procedural safeguards for accepting a valid plea of guilt had been complied with.  Nevertheless, the accused immediately protested with words to the effect that I had 'breached his trust'.  I asked him to clarify what he meant by this remark.  He then said that I had promised him at the last hearing that he could mitigate further.  I do not recall such a promise being made.  Moreover, I had already afforded him a full opportunity to mitigate on 30 October 2003.  Given the contents disclosed in the CT report, it was highly unlikely that I would be persuaded by any further mitigation to decide differently.
22        The accused was not assuaged.  He appeared agitated and continued to maintain that I had breached his trust.  He protested that my decision not to allow any further mitigation was unfair to him.  I thus proceeded to place his remarks on record, after warning him not to continue with further protestations as they could constitute contempt of court.
Conclusion
23        In all likelihood, the accused will count his appearance in court on 3 December 2003 as yet another instance of systemic injustice, unfairness and victimisation.  He will conveniently turn a blind eye to the fact that he had pleaded guilty and had been convicted and sentenced under due process of law.  All this should not come as a surprise in view of the counsellor's concluding remarks at Part Eight of the CT report (page 4) that he was 'an individual with unconventional and criminal thinking, and having a tendency towards minimising his criminal intent'.
24        The sentence will probably also reinforce his own view that 'it is unfair to punish people by incarceration, as everybody makes mistakes' (Part Seven, page 8 of the CT report).  But not everybody persists in committing crimes with the same alarming alacrity and frequency demonstrated by the accused.  These were not one-off offences committed by someone with a hitherto unblemished record.  The accused's criminal record spoke for itself.  From the record, a discernible pattern of persistent reoffending had emerged.
25        Current sentencing policies in dealing with recidivists are clear and consistently applied.  The principles are well-settled in cases such as 
PP v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid
 
[2002] 4 SLR 154
; 
PP v Perumal Suppiah
 
[2000] 3 SLR 308
; 
Tan Ngin Hai v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 161
.  Deterrence and incapacitation are the primary objectives.  There is every justification for a long-term sentence.
26        This was the accused’s 17
th
 conviction in 19 years.  My own assessments of his likelihood of recidivism were amply fortified by the CT report.  All the indicators pointed to him reoffending upon his release.  In the premises, there was no reason why a sentence of seven years' corrective training could be considered manifestly excessive.  Anything less would have failed to adequately protect the public.",2003-12-13 00:00:00,SG District Court

1.         The defendant, a bank, is sued by the plaintiff, its customer.  It arose from the plaintiff’s complaints over foreign exchange transactions that he made through the defendant.
 
2.         The plaintiff is 74 years old and is retired lawyer.  Before he retired from practice in 1997 he had his own practice, with a bank as a major client.  He is a wealthy man, and he agreed with counsel for the defendant, that he is not one to suffer in silence when he feels he has been wronged.
3.         The plaintiff amended his statement of claim three times, the last at the beginning of the hearing.  The main events in the customer-banker relationship pleaded are –
(i)         in August 1997 the plaintiff became a private banking customer of the defendant;
(ii)        on 28 August the plaintiff instructed the defendant to enter into a one-month forward contract with the defendant to buy MYR35,000,000 from the defendant at the rate of MYR2.8818 to US$1 for value 2 October;
(iii)       on 18 September the plaintiff entered into another one-month forward contract to buy MYR5,000,000 from the defendant at MYR3.022 to US$1 for value 20 October;
(iv)       in October the plaintiff took delivery of the MYR40,000,000 using US$ borrowed from the defendant, and
(v)        the MYR40,000,000 was placed in one-month deposit as security for the loan (“the leveraged deposit”);
(vi)       in December the plaintiff adopted the “DFF Strategy” by (i) converting the whole leveraged deposit of MYR48,806,173.83 (inclusive of accrued interest) into US$ and investing that in a fund named the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund (“the SBC Fund”), a US$ denominated fund, and (ii) entering into a 12-month forward selling US$10,439,832.63 and buying MYR41,493,114.79 “at 3.87 (spot + 0.1045 (swap) i.e. 39745 for value 6 Jan 1999"";
(vii)      on 14 May 1998 when the prevailing spot exchange rate was MYR3.84 to US$1, the plaintiff instructed the defendant to sell MYR and buy US$3,000,000.  The defendant completed the transaction, at the rate of MYR4.20 to US$1 after taking into account swap points.  When the plaintiff objected the transaction was reversed at a cost of US$63,500 to him;
(viii)      on 27 July 1998 the plaintiff sold his investment in the SBC Fund and received proceeds of US$11,361,215.57 including a profit of US$816,984.61 or MYR915,245.71;
(ix)       on 27 July the defendant unwound the 12-month forward contract and incurred a loss of MYR2,442,561.03; and
(x)        after the Malaysian government imposed foreign exchange measures on 1 September and fixed the spot exchange rate at MYR3.80 to US$1, the defendant converted the plaintiff’s deposit on the exchange rate of MYR4.00 to US$1.
4.         The plaintiff’s main complaints are that –
(i)         the defendant’s officers, namely Shirreen Sin Meng Mei (“Sin”), associate director/client adviser and the relationship manager assigned to him, and Colin Koh Tse-Ming (“Koh”), director/investment adviser, misrepresented to him when they proposed the DFF Strategy that
(a) his MYR deposit was earning 3.25% interest and he was incurring a negative interest rate differential as he was paying higher interest on his US$ loan,
(b) he could unwind the 12-month MYR contract at any time at the prevailing spot rate, without informing him that swap points may be involved, and how they operate, and
(c) he would retain his MYR leveraged deposit when he entered into the DFF Strategy;
(ii)        the defendant converted his leveraged deposit to invest in the SBC Fund contrary to his instructions;
(iii)       on 2 September the defendant misrepresented to him that the foreign exchange market in Malaysia was closed;
(iv)       the defendant converted MYR44,163,832.51 in the plaintiff’s accounts to US$11,040,956.13 at the exchange rate of MYR4 to US$1 instead of the rate MYR3.80 to US$1 fixed by the Malaysian government;
(v)        the defendant charged the plaintiff handling, custody and safe-keeping and other charges in breach of an agreement that the transfer of his assets were to be transferred from his previous bankers to the defendant “free of payment”; and
(vi)       the defendant has made the aforesaid charges without the plaintiff requesting for safe custody services from the defendant.
The issues
5.         The trial ran for 42 days in three tranches.  The plaintiff was in the witness box for 30 days, but for the morning sessions only, because of health problems.  In the midst of the trial his solicitors Engelin Teh Practice LLC discharged themselves and Chor Pee & Partners were appointed.  The plaintiff applied for leave to make substantial amendments to his re-re-amended statement of claim after the change of solicitors, but failed to obtain leave (see 
Wee Soon Kim Anthony v UBS AG (No 2)

).
6.         The plaintiff’s opening statement set out the issues as
(a) Whether the Defendant had misrepresented to the Plaintiff the nature of the DFF Strategy recommended to him;
(b) Whether the Defendant was negligent and/or in breach of its implied contractual duty of care in its advice on the DFF Strategy to the Plaintiff;
(c) Whether a fiduciary duty of a banker to its customers arises on the facts of this case and if so, whether the Defendant was in its breach of such fiduciary duty;
(d) Whether a collateral contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant arises on the facts of the case under which the Defendant undertook that the adoption of the DFF Strategy would not prevent the Plaintiff from trading or closing out his “original purchase” on the spot market if a suitable opportunity to do so should arise;
(e) If so, whether the Defendant breached the said collateral contract;
(f) Whether the Defendant acted in breach of instructions or mandate in converting the Plaintiff’s leveraged deposit into US$ for investment in the SBC Fund;
(g) Whether the Defendant’s conversion of the Plaintiff’s MYR deposits at the arbitrary rate of MYR4.00 to US$1 instead of the official Bank Negara Malaysia’s rate of MYR3.80 to US$1 in September 1998 was wrongful;
(h) Whether the Defendant’s imposition of the various “safe custody charges” and other debits from the Plaintiff’s accounts were wrongful;
(i) Whether [there should be] an account of all debits made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff’s Hong Kong and Singapore accounts; and
(j) What is the legal effect of the exclusion, exemption and/or limitation clauses in the documentation which the Plaintiff signed on the opening of his accounts with the Defendant.
7.         During the hearing when the facts in dispute were dealt with, and the emphasis on and treatment and identification of the issues evolved.  At the close of the case the plaintiff restated the issues as
(1)        Whether the defendant had exercised reasonable care and skill in advising the plaintiff on the MYR contracts of 28 August and 18 September;
(2)        Whether by the fax of 12 September 1997, the defendant had failed to advise the plaintiff of the risks involved in the forex transaction and to advise him to close out the forward contract maturing on 2 October instead of taking delivery of the MYR;
(3)        Whether the defendant had misrepresented to him in mid-December 1997 that he was paying 6.8% interest on his US$ loan and receiving 3.25% interest on his MYR leveraged deposit; and
(4)        Whether the defendant had misrepresented to him that the DFF Strategy allowed him to exit his MYR position, without informing him that swap points would be involved if he closed out before the maturity date.
8.         The issues in a case must be formulated carefully.  Any issue raised must arise out of the pleaded case.  After the proper issues have been set out at the start of the case, there is still some room for change for the issues to be restated for greater clarity and specificity.  A plaintiff can also reduce the issues at the close of his case if he wants to.  He may decide not to proceed with an issue upon examination of his own case or after considering the evidence and arguments of the defence, or for any other reason.  When an issue is dropped, it is not dealt with any more (the plaintiff’s closing submissions, for example, made no references to the MYR4 to US$1 conversion and the custody charges).
9.         Issues (1) and (2) in the plaintiff’s closing submissions did not come within his re-re-amended statement of claim.  The letter of 12 September was not referred to.  No assertions about those breaches of duty were pleaded.  The plaintiff did not depose to these matters in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.  The first solicitors for the plaintiff were right not to identify them as issues.
10.       Those issues were brought out in the application for the fourth amendment to the statement of claim made after the change of solicitors.  As that application was refused, issues (1) and (2) are not proper issues in this action.  Issues (3) and (4) are proper issues to be considered.
Whether the defendant’s officers had represented to the plaintiff in mid-December 1997 that he was paying 6.8% interest on his US$ loan and receiving 3.25% interest on his MYR leveraged deposit.
11.       The plaintiff recounted in para 45 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that
In early December 1997, Shirreen drew my attention to the fact that because of the short-term volatility of the prevailing foreign exchange market, the MYR one-month deposit interest rate had dropped to a very low rate of about 3.25% per annum.  Meanwhile, the US$14,040,572 loan taken to “purchase” the leveraged deposit was accruing interest at about 6.8% per annum.  I was badly distressed by that news.  I was at that time already shell-shocked by the deteriorating MYR position and was alarmed to learn that I now faced a “double whammy”, i.e. having to face 
the prospect of my borrowing costs in US$ exceeding the interest received on my MYR deposit
 in addition to the risk of a worsening spot exchange risk in the US$/MYR foreign exchange rate
.
  Shirreen then arranged for me to meet Colin Koh and herself on 19 December 1997.  (Emphasis added)
12.       Koh deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that when he and Sin met with the plaintiff on 19 December
At this meeting, Sin and I pointed out that the Plaintiff’s LD was incurring a loss for him as he was paying more in interest on the USD loans than he was receiving on his MYR deposits.  In fact, at the time, the Plaintiff was paying an interest rate of about 6.8% per annum on his USD loans while 
his
 
MYR deposits were only earning him interest at the rate of about 3.25% per annum.
 (Emphasis added)
and Sin confirmed that.
13.       The plaintiff’s MYR deposits were actually earning higher interest than that on 19 December.  The MYR35,000,000 deposit was earning 8.8% interest up to 5 January 1998 when it was rolled over on 3 November 1997 for two months to 5 January 1998, and the MYR5,000,000 deposit was earning 7.37% interest up to 22 December when it was rolled over on 20 November 1997 for one month.
14.       When confronted with that, Sin and Koh conceded that they were mistaken.  They tried to redeem themselves by explaining that when they had the discussion on 19 December, they knew that the defendant would face a negative interest rate differential if he rolled over the deposits again.
15.       While that was correct, it was not what they had deposed to, that on 19 December they told the plaintiff that he was 
already
 experiencing negative interest on his deposits.
16.       By Koh and Sin’s admissions, the answer is yes, the representation was made, but that does not dispose of the matter.  The plaintiff’s claim is that he suffered loss as a result of the representation.
17.       Was the distinction between being already in negative interest, or going in negative interest if the deposits are rolled over material to the plaintiff’s decision?  In his affidavit the plaintiff acknowledged that he was warned about negative interest rate differential and the worsening exchange rate before the meeting of 19 December, and was alarmed by the prospect of being in that position.  When he met Sin and Koh on 19 December, they were still speaking of the negative interest rate differential, though they overstated the case in saying that he was already in that position when he was actually facing the prospect of being in that position.
18.       By his own account, he was sufficiently alarmed at the 
prospect
 of negative interest to want to avoid the “double whammy”.  The prospect was as real whether or not he was already in negative interest, whether he was told “You are in negative interest” or “You will be in negative interest if you roll over the deposits.”
19.       There was no question that if the deposits were rolled over, they would yield reduced interest at around 3.25%.  As the plaintiff subscribed to the SBC Fund to avoid negative interest, and had avoided that, he cannot complain about the advice, the mistake notwithstanding.  He had benefited from the decision.  The plaintiff has not shown that the representation caused him loss.
Whether the defendant’s officers misrepresented to the plaintiff that the DFF Strategy allowed him to exit his MYR position before maturity at market rates without applying swap points
20.       The issue arose because when the plaintiff wanted to close out his forward MYR position on the prevailing spot rate in May 1998, he found that he could not do that, and had to transact on a less favourable rate to him.  It is important to note that he entered into the transaction to close out his existing 12-month forward MYR position, as contrasted to engaging in a stand-alone spot transaction, because for the latter the spot price would apply.
21.       When a purchaser buys currency on a forward contract, e.g. buy MYR with US$ on a 12-month forward contract, he does not pay the spot exchange rate.  As the two currencies would pay interest at different rates, swap points worked out on the difference between the rates have to be factored into the applicable forward exchange rate.  When the transaction is to buy a higher interest currency with a lower interest currency, the swap points will be in favour of the purchaser.  The swap points in such a situation can be described as a discount on the purchase price, or a premium to the purchaser.  When the purchaser decides to close out the forward position before time, he enters into a reverse transaction, to sell the same amount of MYR and buy US$ on the same forward date to cancel the earlier transaction.  It is another forward transaction (albeit for a shorter period), to buy and sell the two currencies in the reversed order.  This second transaction, being a forward transaction, is not transacted on the prevailing spot rate.  Swap points will also have to be worked out on the different interest rates then prevailing.  If that works out to the disadvantage of the buyer he has to pay above the spot rate.
22.       As he wanted to buy to close a forward position swap points would apply.  The question is whether Sin and Koh had informed him of that.  The plaintiff claimed that Sin and Koh represented to him that if he adopted the DFF Strategy by investing in the SBC Fund and entering into a 12 month forward MYR position, he could exit his MYR at the spot rate at any time.  It was also his case that Sin and Koh did not advise him on swap points.
23.       He claimed that he had little or no knowledge or experience in foreign exchange transactions, and did not know about forward contracts, swap points and the consequences of closing out forward contracts before time.  Although he was prepared to buy MYR35,000,000 on a tip that the currency was undervalued, he had no knowledge of the rudiments of foreign exchange transactions.  He said that when he made the first MYR35,000,000 purchase the terms “spot” and “forward” were Greek to him.  That implied that the defendant executed and reported on the transaction without instructions from him on the tenor of the transaction.  If it was done it would be cause for complaint, but he did not complain.  To the contrary the plaintiff pleaded in para 16 of his statement of claim that “(o)n 28 August 1997, the Plaintiff gave instructions to the Defendant to enter into a short term one-month forward contract with the Defendant wherein the Plaintiff would sell US$12,145,187.04 to the Defendant and would buy MYR35,000,000 from the Defendant at the prevailing rate of MYR2.8818 to US$1 as at 28 August 1997.”  This contradicted his plea of ignorance directly.
24.       In the unsuccessful application filed on 6 May 2003 to amend the statement of claim for the fourth time, the plaintiff sought to delete para 16 entirely and plead instead that his intention was to make a “simple purchase” of MYR35,000,000 and that it was his first foray into foreign exchange contracts. During the hearing, it was established as a fact that the MYR35,000,000 transaction was not the plaintiff’s first experience with foreign exchange contracts.  The plaintiff also alleged that he had instructed his previous solicitors to amend para 16, but they refused to carry out his instructions.  Mr Thomas Sim Yuan Po of Engelin Teh Practice LLC who was in charge of the statement of claim gave evidence that the draft statement of claim had been discussed and approved by the plaintiff before it was filed, and that the plaintiff had specifically instructed that para 16 be in the form pleaded in the statement of claim when it was filed on 4 July 2001.  He also explained that there was no refusal to carry out the instructions to amend.  The instructions were not carried out because they were received on 4 June 2002, just before notice was given on 8 June to the plaintiff to appoint new solicitors to act for him.
25.       Before committing to the DFF Strategy, he had received a letter where Koh set out a proposal to purchase MYR on a forward basis against the US$.  On the next day he had a meeting with Koh and Sin when the DFF Strategy was explained to him.  The plaintiff recounted in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that “Colin Koh proceeded to give a vague explanation of the workings of the DFF Strategy which left me confused.”
26.       This meeting was followed up by a letter from Koh and Sin to him dated 23 December.  In this letter the DFF Strategy was explained in the following terms
SBC Dynamic Floor 100% (USD).  This will be the underlying asset for the strategy.  The SBC Dynamic Floor is a USD denominated Fund.  It targets a benchmark return of USD 12-month Euro-bid rate.  (This is 5.82% at the moment).  In Ringgit terms, adjusted for costs, this translates to 8.15% at a spot USD/MYR rate of 3.80 on expiry of the 12-month period.  The Fund is traded on a daily basis and can be liquidated theoretically any time.  In practice, it is advisable to hold the fund for a medium term period of 6-12 months.  This is because of the 1% transaction cost and the fact that the capital preservation structure is contingent on a 12 month holding period.  The fund historically has delivered a superior net return relative to money market.  It is a conservative structure and has historically had a relatively smooth profile of return.  On December 31
st
 , the Floor of the Fund is raised to the Net Asset Value of the fund, this is a defensive feature of the Fund for investors timing their entry at the beginning of a New Year.  In considering the Fund, the investor has to make the subjective judgement that Ringgit interest rates will not be above the benchmark target return of 8.15% in Ringgit terms on a sustainable basis for the full year. (reference: SBC Dynamic Floor 100% Presentation handout)
USD/MYR forward foreign exchange contracts: This is the second part of the strategy.  On the subscription to the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund which is in USD, a 12-months forward foreign exchange contract buying Malaysia Ringgit and selling USD is entered into.  This forward foreign exchange contract may be unwound anytime.  12-month forward Malaysian Ringgit trades at approx 3% premium to the spot or current rates.  This structure enables us to benefit from this as the forward premiums imply 12-month Malaysian deposit rates are higher than the present short term Ringgit deposit rates.  The basis strategy in using the forward foreign exchange in combination with the SBC Dynamic Floor is to actively manage the Ringgit exposure against the USD, i.e. protecting the principal in Ringgit terms when the currency is perceived cheap, and taking the underlying USD exposure when the Ringgit is perceived expensive.
The precise timing of selling the Ringgit (or unwinding the original purchase) will be done in consultation with yourself   Selling the Ringgit would leave open the underlying USD exposure of the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund.  A suggested tentative strategy might look like: Sell MYR 10 million at 3.60, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.55, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.50, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.40.  Each time we sell MYR, we would be squaring off and hence assuming the underlying USD exposure of the Fund.  In a trading environment where the Ringgit trades in a range of 3.30 to 3.90, there will be opportunities to buy back the Ringgit at lower levels perhaps in the 3.80 area.  Effective management of the Ringgit exposures will have the effect of improving the original 2.90 approx cost of your initial Ringgit position.
27.       The plaintiff deposed that the explanation of the 12-month forward trading on a 3% premium to the spot rates was gobbledygook to him.  The letter appeared to be telling him that “(t)he second part of the DFF Strategy was to engage in a 12-month forward hedge buying MYR and sell US$ which could be unwound anytime” and that “(i)n a trading environment where the MYR trades in a range of 3.30 to 3.90, I would be able to take advantage of opportunities to sell my MYR and buy it back at lower levels which would have the effect of improving the cost of my initial MYR position amounting to approximately MYR2.90 to US$1.”
28.       There is nothing remiss in his understanding because he could unwind the forward position at anytime he wanted to.  When the letter referred to the MYR trading in a range of 3.30 to 3.90, it was referring to the market rates, which would be the spot rate for a spot transaction, or the adjusted rates where swap points are involved, in forward transactions.  Even he did not say that he thought it meant that he can close out a forward position by buying at spot prices.
29.       But the consultations did not stop there.  On 24 December Koh and Sin had a further discussion with him, and it was only at this discussion that he finally agreed to adopt the DFF Strategy.
30.       After the defendant took the steps to engage him into the DFF Strategy, Sin wrote to report to him on 29 December that
We have converted your MYR deposit of MYR40,806,173.83 to USD10,544,230.96 at 3.87 for value Jan 5, 1998.  As discussed previously, there is a 1% one time transaction cost.  Thus the amount of USD10,439,832.63 will be invested in the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund USD 100%.
At the same time, we have done a forward for one year at 3.9745, the breakdown being: Client sells USD10,439,832.63 buys MYR41,493,114.79 at 3.87 (spot) + 0.1045 (Swap) i.e. 3.9745 for value 6 Jan 1999.
expressly spelling out the existence and the application of swap points in the transaction.
31.       She still did not leave matters at that.  She went to speak with him a few days later.  The plaintiff recounted in his affidavit
Shirreen visited me sometime soon thereafter (to the best of my recollection, this was just after the New Year).  Richard [the plaintiff’s son] was also present.  Shirreen told Richard and I that I had benefited from a “premium” when entering into the 12-month forward contract.  She further said that I would have to “pay back proportionately” this “premium” if I decided to terminate the 12-month forward contract.  
I was quite mystified by this “premium”.
  However, as Shirreen did not seemed to be at all concerned by this “premium” that she was talking about, 
I did not enquire further
.  (Emphasis added)
32.       Despite all that, it was asserted in the closing submissions that “at no time in December 1997 or even months thereafter did Shirreen Sin or Colin Koh explain to him that unwinding a twelve month forward contract would involve swap points.”
33.       That ran counter to his affidavit and the defendant’s letter of 29 December which showed that he was informed that he had the benefit of 0.1045 swap points when he bought MYR 12-months forward.
34.       The defendant’s case was that the plaintiff was advised on that.  Koh’s evidence that not only swap points were explained, but the effect of swap points was also explained in layman’s terms when these were discussed on 16, 19, 23 and 26 December with the aid of a presentation handout.
35.       The plaintiff denied that the presentation handout was shown or explained to him.  Under cross-examination he relented and conceded that it may have been explained to him on 19 December, but he did not understand it.
36.       It was not disputed that the plaintiff, Sin and Koh met in December and discussed the predicament that he was in and the options available for him to mitigate his losses.  At that time, the plaintiff was very concerned at the position he was in.  The meetings they had were not casual gatherings.  There were serious matters to be discussed and decisions to be taken.  Koh elaborated at the trial that “(t)here are about six hours worth of meetings on the 16
th
, 19
th
, 23
rd
 and also on the 26
th
 in addition after [the letter of 23 December] was written.  And those six hours or meetings, there was very, very full discussion on the operation of the forward in conjunction with the Dynamic Floor Fund.”
37.       It was also clear that the plaintiff only committed himself to the strategy after the discussions, and he was informed of the transactions after they were made.  His own evidence was not that there were no explanations of the premium/swap points and the consequences of closing out a forward position before maturity, but that he did not understand them.  But he did not inform Koh or Sin that or that he still needed more explanation.  After the discussions, he confirmed that he accepted the strategy proposed.
38.       Much was said by his counsel that in the letters, visit reports and the transcript of telephone conversations produced at the trial, there was no explicit statement that the premium/swap points may have to be paid back.  Koh said that that was covered in the discussions they had and I accept that.  Sin had also referred to that to the plaintiff and his son.  The plaintiff’s reply was that the discussions and Sin’s explanation on premium and spot rates were gobbledygook to him.  But he is not diffident or tongue-tied, and he was a big client.  If he needed further explanation, he kept that to himself and gave instructions to enter into the strategy instead.  The evidence was that whenever he sought explanations and clarifications from Sin or Koh, they would provide them.
39.       In these circumstances it cannot be said that Sin or Koh had not informed about the consequences of an early close-up.  He had been advised.  If he had not understood the advice fully, or did not seek clarification, or had forgotten it, he cannot blame it on the defendant or its officers.
Conclusion
40.       The plaintiff’s case commenced with a wide array of allegations and complaints.  In the course of the trial, each of them was examined.  After the change of counsel, an attempt was made to amend the re-re-amended statement of claim by deleting substantial portions of it and replacing them with new matters.
41.       When leave to amend was refused, the plaintiff redrew the issues.  Of the four issues, two were outside the pleaded case.  The other two were factual in nature – whether the defendant’s officers had made the alleged misrepresentations.
42.       I find that there was a misrepresentation that the plaintiff was in negative interest in mid-December 1997 when he was not.  However the advice rendered was fundamentally sound, and the plaintiff had not suffered any loss when he acted on it.
43.       On the other issue whether it was represented to the plaintiff that he could close the forward MYR position before maturity at the market rates without applying swap points, I find that there was no representation of this nature.  If the plaintiff really believed that he was assured that he could do that, he was mistaken.
44.       For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs, which are to be taxed for two counsel.
Costs of Engelin Teh Practice LLC
45.       In the course of the cross-examination of the plaintiff, it was shown to him on several occasions that his evidence was inconsistent with his pleaded case and his affidavits.  The plaintiff’s explanations were that the inconsistencies had arisen because the pleadings and affidavits were drafted by Mr Thomas Sim of Engelin Teh Practice LLC, and did not accurately reflect his instructions, and that he had instructed Mr Sim to amend para 16, but he refused to comply with the instructions.
46.       The plaintiff did not call Mr Sim as his witness and did not agree for him to give evidence, except on his terms.  Subsequently, after he dropped those conditions and agreed to waive solicitor-client privilege, Mr Sim appeared as a witness.
47.       Mr Sim’s attendance in court was necessary.  First, it could provide a better basis for assessing the plaintiff’s contention that the inconsistencies should not be taken against him.  Secondly, it was not right for allegations to be made of a solicitor’s competence at drafting and his refusal to carry out a client’s instructions without giving him the opportunity to respond to them.
48.       When Mr Sim attended court, he had prepared a statement and a voluminous set of documents to respond to the allegation.  A bill for costs for the attendance was also produced.
49.            Counsel for both parties accept that costs are payable.  The plaintiff’s solicitors contended that it should follow the event (which I take to mean the losing party should pay the costs), or be borne by the defendant, while the defendant’s solicitors argued that it should be paid by the plaintiff in any event.
50.       It was proper and reasonable for Mr Sim to respond and to attend court.  In the present case the costs should not be borne by either the plaintiff or the defendant in any event.  They should follow the result in that the losing party shall pay them.  These costs are to be borne by the plaintiff.
51.       The costs are not claimed by Mr Sim himself but by Engelin Teh Practice LLC in which he practices.  The costs claimed are for work done by him and Ms Engelin Teh SC, disbursements and GST.
52.       The costs to be paid should be confined to Mr Sim’s work, disbursements and GST.  The allegations were made against him, and he was called to respond to them.  Ms Teh, being the head of the practice, would be concerned over the plaintiff’s allegations.  She attended court when Mr Sim gave evidence, but did not give evidence or take a significant part in the proceedings at that stage.  While I accept that she would have spent time to assist or supervise the preparation of Mr Sim’s response, no costs are recoverable for that from the plaintiff.  The parties are to revert to me if they cannot agree on the quantum of the costs the plaintiff is to pay to Engelin Teh Practice LLC.",2003-12-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

On 19 October 1987 the High Court of Singapore ordered that the appellant be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore. On 25 October 1988 their Lordships allowed the appellant`s appeal from that order indicating that they would give the reasons for their decision later. This they now do.
 The background
The Workers` Party of Singapore is a political party in the ordinary sense, but is also, unlike English political parties, a body having legal personality under Singapore law. The appellant is the secretary-general of the Workers` Party. In 1972 the Workers` Party sued Tay Boon Too (Tay), a member of Parliament, for slander in respect of words spoken in the 1972 general election campaign. The action failed and the Workers` Party were ordered to pay Tay`s costs. A liability under this order for a sum exceeding $17,000 remained unsatisfied.
In the 1980 general election the appellant himself stood unsuccessfully as a Workers` Party candidate for Parliament. Madam Chiew Kim Kiat (Mdm Chiew), the mother of the appellant`s election agent, brought an election petition against the appellant`s successful opponent alleging electoral irregularities. The petition was dismissed with costs.
In 1981 the appellant was elected to Parliament in a by-election and became the sole member in opposition to the ruling People`s Action Party. At the general election in 1984 he was re-elected.
 The crucial events of 1982
By the beginning of 1982 the judgment debt for the balance of Tay`s costs, after the lapse of more than six years, had become unenforceable by execution without the leave of the court. Early in 1982 bankruptcy proceedings were instituted against Mdm Chiew in respect of the unpaid balance of her liability for costs incurred in the unsuccessful election petition proceedings. The salient events in 1982 are best recounted in chronological order.
On 19 January the appellant received by post a cheque drawn by Dr Ivy Chew Wan Heong (Dr Chew) for $2,000 made payable to the Workers` Party (the $2,000 cheque). This was then endorsed by the appellant and Wong Hong Toy (Wong), the chairman of the Workers` Party, in favour of Mdm Chiew`s solicitors as a contribution to help meet her liability for costs in respect of the election petition proceedings. On 23 January Tay`s solicitor wrote to the appellant`s firm, as solicitors for the Workers` Party, demanding payment of the costs due to Tay. On 3 February Tay applied to the court for leave to execute for the unpaid costs. On 17 February the $2,000 cheque was handed to Madam Chiew`s solicitors. On 22 February Tay was granted leave to execute and the court made a garnishee order in his favour on the Workers` Party`s bank account. On 8 March the garnishee order was made absolute and the bank paid over the balance of $18.47 standing to the credit of the Workers` Party`s account. On 10 March the appellant and Wong received a cheque for $200 drawn by Ping Koon Yam (Ping) in favour of the Workers` Party with the word `bearer` crossed out (the $200 cheque). Ping then altered the cheque to a bearer cheque by overriding the cancellation of the word `bearer`. The cheque was paid into Wong`s personal account. Wong drew $200 in cash from the account and handed it to Mdm Chiew`s solicitors as a contribution towards her liability for costs. On 12 March, the date fixed for the hearing of the bankruptcy petition against Mdm Chiew, her solicitors were able to discharge her outstanding liability for costs by handing over to the petitioner`s solicitors $2,655 including the proceeds of the $2,000 and $200 cheques and other money collected for her by the Workers` Party.
On 22 May Tay applied to the court for the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution. On the same day Willie Lim Tian Sze (Willie Lim) made a donation to the Workers` Party in the form of a crossed cheque for $400 payable to the Workers` Party (the $400 cheque). On 1 June the Official Receiver was appointed by the court as receiver of the Workers` Party`s assets. Some days later Willie Lim was invited by Wong in the presence of the appellant to alter the $400 cheque and agreed to do so. He uncrossed the cheque and made it payable not to the Workers` Party but to cash.
On 21 July the Official Receiver wrote to A Balakrishnan, the treasurer of the Workers` Party, asking for the accounts of the Workers` Party for 1980, 1981 and up to 3 June 1982, and for all the relevant account books, vouchers and other accounting documents for this period. Balakrishnan complied with this request and, in response to a further request, filed an affidavit verifying the accounts for the period 1 January to 16 June 1982. The accounts contained no entries referring to the transactions represented by the cheques previously referred to.
The Official Receiver then requested the appellant and Wong, as secretary-general and chairman of the Workers` Party, to make a statutory declaration to confirm the accounts. A document purporting to be a joint statutory declaration verifying the accounts was submitted to the appellant and Wong in a form drafted by the Official Receiver and they duly went through the formalities of making the declaration. It is common ground, however, that the document was not a statutory declaration at all, since it did not contain the vital words `and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the Statutory Declarations Act 1835`. On 6 August the Official Receiver swore his own affidavit, which was duly lodged in the court, verifying his own account of the receivership and exhibiting, inter alia, the declaration by the appellant and Wong in support of his own statement of information and belief that the exhibited accounts of the Workers` Party were true.
 The criminal proceedings
Arising out of these events the appellant and Wong were jointly charged with three offences and each was separately charged with a fourth offence. The three joint charges were laid under s 421 of the Singapore Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) which provides: 
 
Whoever dishonestly or fraudulently removes, conceals, or delivers to any person, or transfers or causes to be transferred to any person, without adequate consideration, any property, intending thereby to prevent, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby prevent, the distribution of that property according to law among his creditors or the creditors of any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
 
 
 
These charges (the cheque charges) related to the disposal of the $2,000, $200 and $400 cheques respectively. The ingredients of each of these offences which the prosecution needed to prove were: 
 
 
(1) that the cheque was the property of the Workers` Party; 
 
(2) that the accused jointly transferred it without adequate consideration; 
 
(3) that they did so intending or knowing that it would be likely to prevent the distribution of the property according to law amongst the creditors of the Workers` Party, meaning thereby the payment of the proceeds of the cheque to the creditor Tay; 
 
(4) that in so doing they acted fraudulently.
  
 
 
The fourth separate charge against each accused was laid under s 199 of the Penal Code which provides: 
 
Whoever, in any declaration made or subscribed by him, which declaration any court of justice, or any public servant or other person, is bound or authorized by law to receive as evidence of any fact, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, touching any point material to the object for which the declaration is made or used, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.
 
 
 
These charges (the accounts charges) related to the purported statutory declaration. The falsity alleged was the omission in the accounts which the declaration verified of any entry relating to the cheques which were the subject of the cheque charges. In this sense the accounts charges were parasitic upon the cheque charges. It was alleged that the accused had, so to speak, compounded their fraudulent dealings with the cheques by failing to own up to them when they were required to verify the accounts. But an offence under s 199 is much graver than an offence under s 421. It is treated as equivalent to an offence of perjury under s 193 and is punishable by up to seven years` imprisonment.
 The first trial
These charges came for trial before Senior District Judge Michael Khoo. He gave written reasons for his decision on 30 March 1984.
Judge Khoo ruled at the close of the prosecution case that there was no case to answer on the accounts charges on the ground that the purported statutory declaration, lacking the essential words of affirmation, was not within s 199. He rejected a submission that it was a document, which `any court of justice` was `bound or authorized to receive as evidence of any fact` because it could be, as it was, exhibited to the affidavit of the Official Receiver in the receivership proceedings in support of his own accounts. Judge Khoo refused various applications by the prosecution to substitute amended charges for the accounts charges under s 199.
Judge Khoo acquitted both accused of the charges in respect of the $2,000 and $200 cheques. He held that in each case the prosecution had failed to prove that the cheque was, at the material time, the property of the Workers` Party. In the case of the $2,000 cheque he accepted the evidence of the appellant that he had received a note from Dr Chew with the cheque authorizing him to use it as he thought fit, and that after deciding to use the money to help Mdm Chiew meet her liability for costs he had confirmed with Dr Chew that he could use the money as he wished. The receipt and disposal of the $2,000 cheque were reported to a meeting of the executive council of the Workers` Party on 16 February 1982 and recorded in the minutes. In the case of the $200 cheque judge Khoo accepted the evidence of both accused that Ping, the donor, had agreed that the proceeds of the cheque should be used to help Mdm Chiew and, instead of making out a further cheque payable to Mdm Chiew, had altered the cheque to make it payable to bearer.
Judge Khoo found confirmation of these findings in two statutory declarations by Dr Chew which had been tendered in evidence (presumably without objection) and in a contemporary record kept by Wong of money collected for Madam Chiew, which included a reference to Ping`s $200 and which the judge accepted as genuine.
The explanations given by the defence in relation to the $2,000 and $200 cheques accorded with what they had told the police when first questioned. Judge Khoo noted that the prosecution had taken statements from Dr Chew and Ping and subpoenaed them but had elected not to call them to testify.
Independently of his findings that these two cheques were not the property of the Workers` Party, Judge Khoo carefully analysed the evidence bearing upon the chronology of the steps taken to enforce Tay`s judgment for the balance of the costs of the 1972 action in relation to the actions of the accused in their dealings with the two cheques. He expressed his conclusion thus: 
 
Having regard therefore to all the circumstances surrounding the receipt of the cheques, the time of their receipt and their eventual disbursement to the solicitors of Mdm Chiew and the reasons therefore, I was not satisfied that the acts of the accused in the delivery of the cheques were done with a fraudulent intention to prevent their distribution according to law, amongst the creditors of the party.
 
 
 
Judge Khoo convicted both accused of the $400 cheque charge. He accepted the evidence of Willie Lim, disputed by the defence, that it was on a date after the appointment of the receiver that he agreed, at the invitation of Wong and in the presence of the appellant, to alter his cheque to make it payable to cash and that this was done expressly to prevent the proceeds reaching the receiver on behalf of Tay. The judge drew the inference from this evidence and the subsequent encashment of the cheque that Wong and the appellant had acted jointly in transferring the property of the Workers` Party in the $400 cheque without adequate consideration and with the fraudulent intention of preventing the property being distributed according to law amongst the party`s creditors, by payment to the receiver for the creditor Tay. Each accused was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000.
 The first appeal
Under the Singapore Criminal Procedure Code appeal lies from the District Court to the High Court against conviction or sentence by the accused and against acquittal or sentence by the Public Prosecutor: ss 245 and 247. The appeal is ordinarily to be heard by a single judge: s 252(3). The grounds on which the High Court are to act are indicated, somewhat obliquely, by s 261 which provides: 
 
No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court ... shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
In this case the Public Prosecutor appealed against the acquittals on the accounts charges and the first two cheque charges and also against sentence on the $400 cheque charge. The appellant and Wong appealed against conviction on the $400 cheque charge. These appeals were heard by Wee Chong Jin CJ in May 1984. He gave judgment in writing on 18 April 1985 [see 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 133
 ].
Dealing with the accounts charges, the Chief Justice reasoned as follows. Under O 30 of the Rules of the Supreme Court the receiver appointed by the court was required to submit accounts to the court and to verify them by affidavit. Under O 4 r 5(2) an affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in interlocutory proceedings may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof. The Chief Justice concluded: 
 
In my judgment, the declaration, being a document which was permitted by O 41 r 5(2) to form part of the affidavit accompanying the receiver`s own account presented to the High Court for passing and certification, was a declaration which the court was authorized by the Rules of the Supreme Court to receive as evidence in the receivership proceedings.
 
 
 
He therefore set aside the acquittal and ordered a retrial of both accused on the accounts charges.
The judgment of the Chief Justice dealing with the charges relating to the $2,000 and $200 cheques is extremely long and their Lordships find some of the reasoning difficult to follow. Since it will be necessary later in this judgment to return to examine this part of the judgment of the Chief Justice to see whether it can be supported, their Lordships will not at this point attempt to do more than summarize its salient features. The Chief Justice began with an unexceptionable statement of the principles governing his appellate jurisdiction under the Criminal Procedure Code as follows: 
 
It is settled law that this court in the exercise of its statutory appellate criminal jurisdiction has full power to review at large the evidence upon which an order of conviction or acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order should be reversed. In reviewing the evidence and before reaching its conclusions upon fact this court should always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as: 
(1) the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of witnesses; 
(2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused; 
(3) the right of the accused to the benefit of the doubt; and 
(4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.
 
 
 
He went on, however, to reject as untrue the evidence which the trial judge had accepted as true given by the appellant and Wong in the two vital areas, namely, with respect to their communications with Dr Chew and Ping, the donors of the two cheques, regarding the donor`s intentions with respect to the disposal of the proceeds of the cheques. He held, in effect, that the cheques themselves were so made out as to found an inference that they were the property of the Workers` Party and that this could only be rebutted by the defence calling Dr Chew and Ping to give evidence. He further declared himself satisfied, contrary to the view of the trial judge, that the transfers had been fraudulently intended to prevent the distribution of the property according to law amongst the creditors of the Workers` Party. He therefore allowed the Public Prosecutor`s appeal against acquittal on both these charges and sentenced each of the accused to pay a fine of $1,000 on each charge.
On the $400 charge the Chief Justice dismissed both the appeals of the accused against conviction and that of the Public Prosecutor against sentence.
On 21 June 1985 the appellant and Wong applied to the Chief Justice pursuant to s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) that he should reserve certain questions of law arising from his decision on the appeals from judge Khoo for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The subsection provides: 
 
When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court the judge may on the application of any party and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal.
 
 
 
The questions of law which the Chief Justice was asked to reserve included the following: 
 
 
(1) On the accounts charges:
  
 
 
whether the declaration by the respondents was a declaration within the scope and meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code.` 
(2) On the $2,000 and $200 cheque charges: 
(a) whether the property in the cheques for $2,000 and $200 was in the Workers` Party before the cheques were negotiated; 
(b) ) on whom was the onus to prove the property of the cheques in the Workers` Party and whether such onus was discharged by the party on whom it lay on the whole of the evidence adduce before the court; 
(c) ) whether the said onus shifted at any time from one party to the other, alternatively whether there was any onus on the respondents at any stage of the trial to prove that the property in the said cheques was not in the Workers` Party; 
(d) ) whether on the whole of the evidence adduced before the court the prosecution had discharged the onus on it to satisfy the court that the respondents fraudulently transferred the property in the said cheques assuming the property in the said cheques was in the Workers` Party; 
(e) ) whether the High Court was right and justified on well-established principles of law in disturbing the very careful findings of fact made by the trial judge before acquitting the respondents on the charges. 
(3) On the $400 cheque charge:
 
 
 
whether the property in the cheque for $400 remained with the Workers` Party after the end of May 1982 and in particular was it so on 2 July 1982 when the proceeds of the cheque were realized.
 
 
 
The Chief Justice refused this application on the ground that none of these questions were questions of law and that, even if they were, they were not of public interest.
The appellant and Wong nevertheless sought to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal but failed, as they were bound to, because s 44(1) only gives jurisdiction to the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear an appeal `against any decision by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction There is thus no avenue of appeal from the decision of a High Court judge exercising appellate jurisdiction from the District Court under s 247 of the Criminal Procedure Code unless that judge has reserved a question of law for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. It was so held by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Lai Kew Chai J, LP Thean J and FA Chua J) dismissing the appeals of the appellant and Wong on 9 October 1985. This decision was, in effect, affirmed when special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was refused on 6 March 1986.
 The re-trial on the accounts charges
Having failed to persuade the Chief Justice to reserve the question of law arising on the construction of s 199 of the Penal Code, it is not surprising that the appellant and Wong then applied to have the re-trial transferred from the District Court to the High Court pursuant to s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code. If this application had succeeded, it would have opened up an avenue of appeal on the issue whether the joint declaration was a document which a `court of justice ... is bound or authorized by law to receive as evidence of any fact` to the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first instance and, if necessary, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This was the manifest purpose of the application. Their Lordships must confess their astonishment that LP Thean J, in refusing this application, held that any attempt to reopen this issue and or go behind the Chief Justice`s ruling would be an abuse of the process of the court. It was further urged that as secretary-general and chairman of a political party in opposition to the party in power facing a charge with such serious implications, the appellant and Wong should, in any event, be tried by the High Court, not the District Court. LP Thean J dismissed this consideration as irrelevant.
Re-trial accordingly took place before judge Foenander, who had now replaced judge Khoo as senior district judge. He gave judgment convicting both accused on 8 April 1986 and sentenced both to three months` imprisonment. Both appealed to the High Court against conviction and sentence. The appeal was heard by Lai Kew Chai J. On 10 November 1986 he dismissed the appeals against conviction, but allowed the appeals against sentence to the extent of substituting for the sentence of three months` imprisonment in each case a sentence of one month`s imprisonment plus a fine of $5,000. [See 
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 553
 .] For the appellant this was indeed a Pyrrhic victory, since a person sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000 or more on any single criminal charge is automatically disqualified for five years from membership of Parliament. The appellant thus lost his seat as the single opposition member and was unable to stand at the next general election in 1988.
The proceedings on the re-trial and appeal followed a predictable course. Both judge Foenander at first instance and Lai Kew Chai J on appeal applied the reasoning of the Chief Justice in holding that the declaration verifying the accounts fell within s 199 of the Penal Code and found that the accounts were false in omitting reference to the cheques which had been the subject of the cheque charges. On the re-trial neither the appellant nor Wong gave evidence.
An application to Lai Kew Chai J under s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to reserve, inter alia, a question of law as to whether, on its true construction, s 199 of the Penal Code applied to the joint declaration verifying the accounts was refused on 11 November 1986. The question, although more elaborately formulated, was essentially the same as the question which the Chief Justice had refused to reserve in June 1985. Again predictably, Lai Kew Chai J echoed, albeit at greater length, the view of the Chief Justice that the question was not one of law or, if it was, was not of public interest. No question having been reserved, further attempts by Wong and the appellant to challenge their convictions on the accounts charges before the Court of Criminal Appeal and by way of application for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council failed, as they were bound to, for want of jurisdiction.
 The disciplinary proceedings
Under s 80 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) (the Act) an advocate and solicitor is liable to be struck off the roll, suspended or censured on the ground, inter alia, that he `has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession`. On 14 November 1986 the Attorney General reported to the Law Society of Singapore that the appellant had been convicted of three offences under s 421 and one offence under s 199 of the Penal Code, asserted that the offences implied a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession and requested that the matter be referred to a Disciplinary Committee. Thereafter the disciplinary proceedings followed a course which, save in one respect, was inevitable. The Disciplinary Committee reported that the appellant had been convicted of criminal offences implying a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession and that cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action to be taken. The appellant was thereupon summoned to show cause why he should not be truck off, suspended or censured. Realistically the only chance that the appellant had of avoiding being struck off was if the court could be persuaded to go behind the convictions. The matter came before the Chief Justice, FA Chua J and Chan Sek Keong JC. At the outset objection was taken to the Chief Justice sitting on the ground that it would be inappropriate in the light of the history, although no bias or prejudice was alleged against him. The court rejected the objection. Section 95(6) of the Act provides that the proceedings on the summons to show cause `shall be heard by a court of three judges of whom the Chief Justice shall be one`. The court held this provision to be mandatory. The court went on to hold that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify going behind the convictions and that, in any event, the convictions were unimpeachable. Given offences of such gravity, an order that the appellant be st ruck off the roll of advocates and solicitors inexorably followed. [See 
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 353
 .]
Their Lordships must record their opinion that the refusal of the appellant`s objection to the Chief Justice sitting was both erroneous and unfortunate. It was erroneous because, in their Lordships` judgment, the relevant provision of s 95(6) is clearly not mandatory but directory only. Section 95(8) in terms provides: 
 
The Chief Justice or any other judge of the Supreme Court shall not be a member of the court of three judges when the application under subsection (6) is in respect of a complaint made or information referred to the Society by him.
 
 
 
It would be absurd that the Chief Justice should not be able to disqualify himself from sitting if the advocate and solicitor facing disciplinary charges was either a close relative or a sworn enemy or for any other good reason. The refusal of the objection was unfortunate because the court was to be invited to go behind and condemn the Chief Justice`s own decision on the appeals from judge Khoo and his later refusal to reserve questions of law for the Court of Criminal Appeal. It was quite unacceptable that he should preside. Justice might be done, but certainly could not be seen to be done.
The order that the appellant be struck off was made on 19 October 1987. The court refused a stay of execution. Leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was granted pursuant to s 3(1)(a) of the Judicial Committee Act (Cap 148) on 4 November 1987. An application to the Board for a stay of execution was refused on 21 December 1987. The judgment giving the court`s reasons for the decision that the appellant should be struck off was delivered on 12 January 1988.
 The issues in the appeal
A number of grounds were advanced in the appellant`s written case. Their Lordships only found it necessary to examine two questions. First, were there exceptional circumstances which justified the court in the disciplinary proceedings, and the Board on appeal, in going behind the convictions? Secondly, if so were the convictions flawed? Inevitably the two questions overlap since any conclusion as to the propriety of going behind the convictions depends to an extent on the nature of the attack on the convictions.
The question whether it is possible in disciplinary proceedings under the Act to go behind convictions relied upon as the basis of a disciplinary charge was considered in 
 Ratnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 195
 
 . 
Delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Simon of Glaisdale said at pp 200, 201: 
 
There is a preliminary point which arises, namely, whether in disciplinary proceedings under the Legal Profession Act it is open, for the purposes of s 84(2)(a) (conviction implying a defect of character) to go behind the conviction and inquire whether it was correctly made. The Disciplinary Committee held that it was not open to them to go behind the conviction. The High Court assumed that it was open to them to go behind the conviction, though, having done so, they held that the appellant was rightly convicted. It is, strictly, unnecessary for their Lordships to express an opinion on this point ... But, since the matter was fully argued before their Lordships, they think it proper to state that they agree with the view of the High Court. They would, however, add this rider. Although it is open to go behind the conviction, this would only be justified in exceptional circumstances. Their Lordships will not attempt to lay down what circumstances should be considered so exceptional as to permit the question whether the accused had been rightly convicted to be raised, beyond saying that an important consideration would be whether an appeal against the conviction had been available. For example, if a plea of guilty had been made under a misunderstanding, and there was no opportunity of rectifying it on appeal, justice would demand that the conviction should not be conclusive against the accused in the course of disciplinary proceedings, the object of which themselves is, after all, to promote justice.
 
 
 
In the instant case their Lordships consider the following circumstances sufficiently exceptional at least to warrant examination of the grounds on which the convictions are attacked as bad in law. The conviction of the appellant on the accounts charge depends on a construction of s 199 of the Penal Code first propounded by the Chief Justice sitting as a single judge and later adopted by judge Foenander and Lai Kew Chai J, which is attacked as bad in law. The convictions on the $2,000 and $200 cheque charges depend on findings of fact by the Chief Justice reversing the primary findings of the trial judge on grounds which are attacked as bad in law. The affirmation by the Chief Justice of the conviction by judge Khoo of the $400 cheque charge is attacked as bad in law. The appellant has had no opportunity to test any of the questions of law which he claims are involved by appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore or, if necessary, by further appeal to the Board, because the Chief justice and Lai Kew Chai J refused to reserve any questions of law pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and, in the absence of such reservation, neither the Court of Criminal Appeal nor the Board had any jurisdiction to entertain any appeal. If it can be shown that there were questions of law of public interest which should have been reserved for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal and that this would have led to the quashing of the convictions either by the Court of Criminal Appeal or on appeal by the Board, it must surely be appropriate, to quote Lord Simon`s words `that the conviction(s) should not be conclusive against the accused in the course of disciplinary proceedings, the object of which themselves is, after all, to promote justice`.
Their Lordships have from the outset entertained no doubt that these convictions do indeed raise serious questions of law and they find it difficult to understand how any serious question of law arising in a criminal case on which a person`s conviction of a grave offence may depend can be said not to be `of public interest` within the meaning of s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. In the end, therefore, the determination of the appeal turns on the question whether the convictions are vitiated by errors of law.
 The accounts charge
Section 199 of the Penal Code, as already pointed out, creates an offence of the same gravity as perjury under s 193. The language, if in any way ambiguous, should be construed narrowly to restrict the ambit of the criminal net which the section casts. But, in their Lordships` judgment, there is really no ambiguity. What is required is a declaration which is per se admissible `as evidence of any fact`. A statement which is not a statutory declaration, but which is relied on by the deponent to an affidavit containing a statement of information and belief and is exhibited to the affidavit to show the source of the deponent`s information and belief is not admissible as evidence of the facts stated, although it may be received in evidence. The evidence admissible to prove the facts stated is the deponent`s affidavit of his information and belief, not the statement relied upon as the source of it. Any other construction of s 199 would create a potential offence of perjury by the maker of a casual statement to a third party who later relied upon it in an affidavit of information and belief or, to take another example canvassed in argument, by a witness who gave a proof of evidence to a solicitor which was later put in evidence by agreement of the parties. It can make no difference whether or not the maker of the statement or the witness who signed the statement or the witness who signed his proof knew that the statement or proof was likely to be put in evidence.
It follows, in their Lordships` judgment, that the charges against the appellant and Wong under s 199 were misconceived in law, as judge Khoo held, quite apart from any question on the merits as to whether the accounts verified by the declaration ought to have included reference to the transactions which were the subject of the cheque charges. The appellant`s conviction on this charge was fatally flawed.
 The cheque charges
It is fundamental to a proper understanding of the transactions which gave rise to the cheque charges to appreciate the legal implications of the fact that the three cheques were given by way of voluntary donation. Each cheque made payable to the Workers` Party was a revocable mandate to the drawer`s bank to pay the amount shown and a revocable promise to the Workers` Party that the amount would be paid. At any time before the cheque was presented for payment or negotiated by the Workers` Party the drawer could revoke the mandate and the promise by stopping payment of the cheque. The Workers` Party could not sue on the cheque because it was given for no consideration. It follows that the drawer, as donor, could at any time before the cheque was presented for payment or negotiated by the Workers` Party give authority to any person holding the cheque to dispose of it as the donor wished. It is fair to all concerned to point out that these important considerations do not appear to have been fully appreciated at any stage in the criminal proceedings or to have been adequately formulated in argument until the matter reached the Board.
 The $2,000 and $200 cheque charges
As related earlier in this judgment, the evidence of the appellant was to the effect that the $2,000 cheque had been endorsed over to Madam Chiew`s solicitors with the full authority of the drawer, Dr Chew. Judge Khoo pointed out that this was the only evidence of Dr Chew`s intention, that it was substantial confirmed by Dr Chew`s statutory declarations and that the prosecution had had every opportunity to call Dr Chew but had not done so. As their Lordships read judge Khoo`s judgment, he accepted the appellant`s evidence on this issue without reserve or qualification.
On appeal the Chief Justice quoted two short passages from the judgment of judge Khoo which read as follows: 
 
At the conclusion of the trial, the only evidence I had concerning the intentions of both Dr Chew and Ping when donating their respective cheques were the testimonies of both accused, although in the course of the prosecution`s case, the defence had tendered two statutory declarations sworn to by Dr Chew, albeit in another (the receivership) proceeding (exhibit D4 and D5) which substantially confirmed what the second accused had said regarding her donation.
 
 
 
... In respect of these two charges, the prosecution had to my mind failed to prove an essential ingredient of the offence, namely, that the $2,000 and $200 cheques were the property of the Workers` Party.
The Chief Justice went on: 
 
It seems to me implicit in these two passages that the trial judge`s finding that the prosecution had failed to prove that the $2,000 cheque was the property of the Workers` Party was because he construed the contents of Dr Chew`s two statutory declarations as substantially confirming Jeyaretnam`s evidence and 
 not because he found Jeyaretnam to be a credible witness whose evidence he accepted
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Their Lordships can find no warrant whatever for the view that judge Khoo did not find the appellant to be a credible witness whose evidence on this issue he accepted. But this was the cornerstone of the Chief Justice`s judgment on this charge. As an appellate judge who had not seen or heard the witnesses, it was only if he could validly reject the trial judge`s ending of primary fact based on acceptance of witnesses whose evidence he had seen and heard that he, the appellate judge, could substitute his own findings of fact. This the Chief Justice then proceeded to do. He ignored the fact that the prosecution had taken a statement from Dr Chew and subpoenaed her as a witness, but elected not to call her. He repeatedly referred to the failure of the defence to call Dr Chew. Two key passages in his judgment read as follows: 
 
I am unable to accept Jeyaratnam`s evidence that there was a note to him from Dr Chew and consequently I do not accept his evidence of their subsequent telephone conversation for the following reasons. It was highly unlikely that Dr Chew would write the words `Workers` Party` on the face of the cheque and send it to Jeyaratnam with a note, the contents of which were as related by Jeyaratnam, if she did not intend to donate the sum specified on its face to the Workers Party. If her intention was different from that as expressed on the face of the cheque, 
 her
 evidence was 
 necessary
 to explain why she wrote the words `Workers` Party` on the face of the cheque when she intended someone else to be the donee of her $2,000 gift and, if her intention was to donate the $2,000 to Jeyaratnam to be used by him for any purpose he thought fit, it was essential for her to give an explanation why she named the Workers` Party and not Jeyaratnam as the payee on the face of the cheque ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
... In my judgment, it was sufficient for the prosecution to rely on the cheque itself as proof that the cheque was the property of the Workers` Party but, having regard to the nature and content of the defence on the issue of Dr Chew`s intention, the defence should have called her as a witness who could give evidence in support of Jeyaratnam`s evidence.
This judgment starts from a false premise with respect to the trial judge`s assessment of the evidence he had heard and proceeds upon a clear misdirection with respect to the onus of proof. It cannot be supported.
On the $200 cheque charge the trial judge again clearly accepted the evidence of Wong as to the circumstances m which the donor, Ping, had altered his cheque to make it payable to bearer. The Chief Justice, after citing a lengthy passage from the judgment of judge Khoo, said: 
 
If the correct inference from that passage was that the trial judge accepted Wong`s account of what Ping said, it is clear that he did not base it on his acceptance of Wong as a reliable and credible witness and that he failed to observe, analyse or consider the undisputed facts and material probabilities.
 
 
 
Beyond this their Lordships need only quote two other critical passages from the Chief Justice`s judgment as follows: 
 
It seems to me to be plain that by naming the Workers` Party as the payee in his cheque, Ping`s intention must be taken to have been that the property in the cheque should pass to the Workers` Party as a donation from him.
 
 
 
... In my judgment, on a full consideration of the material evidence and the circumstances and bearing in mind that an appellate court should be slow in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses but is nonetheless duty bound to review at large the evidence upon which that findings was reached, I am satisfied that the trial judge was wrong in accepting Wong`s account and in finding that Ping had no intention of transferring the property in his cheque to the Workers` Party. I am also satisfied that Wong`s account of what Ping said when he handed his cheque to Wong was untrue. It follows, in my opinion inescapably, that Jeyaratnam`s recollections, as given in evidence by him, that Wong told him Ping wanted to give something for Madam Chiew`s costs must also be untrue as was his recollection that he endorsed it so that they could get the money for Madam Chiew. Accordingly, I find that at all material times Ping`s cheque was the property of the Workers` Party.
There is much besides by way of a purported analysis of the evidence by which the Chief Justice seeks to justify his direct rejection of the evidence which the trial judge had plainly accepted. But their Lordships find the reasoning wholly unconvincing. On this issue, the trial judge did accept Wong as a reliable and credible witness and found his evidence to be corroborated by a genuine contemporary document which the prosecution had vainly sought to challenge and which the Chief Justice ignored. In setting out to controvert the trial judge`s primary findings of fact on this central issue, the Chief Justice patently exceeded the proper function of an appellate court and wholly ignored the advantage enjoyed by the trial judge who had seen and heard the witnesses. This amounted to a serious error of law which vitiated the Chief Justice`s decision.
Having reached these conclusions, it is unnecessary for their Lordships to the further question whether it was open to the Chief Justice to reverse the finding of the trial judge on the issue of the fraudulent intent of the accused.
 The $400 cheque charge
This was perhaps the simplest case of all and here it was the trial judge who fell into error probably because the right point was never clearly taken. On the prosecution`s own evidence, the case against the accused was bound to fail. Willie Lim`s cheque made payable to the Workers` Party had never been negotiated or presented for payment. It remained, therefore, an imperfect gift which Willie Lim was fully entitled to withdraw. That is just what he did. On his own evidence, led for the prosecution, precisely in order to prevent the proceeds of the cheque going to the receiver for Tay, to whom he obviously did not want to make a voluntary gift, he altered the cheque to make it payable to cash. It was just as if he had stopped payment of the cheque or tom it up and made a gift of cash to Wong. In the circumstances no offence by Wong or the appellant was committed.
 Conclusion
The Workers` Party never had more than a defeasible title to the proceeds of the cheques. Before the title was perfected the cheque was in each case lawfully disposed of in accordance with the donor`s instructions. The appellant and Wong were innocent of any offence under s 421 and even if the declaration veer the accounts had been one to which s 199 applied, they had a good defence on the merits to the accounts charges.
It was for these reasons that their Lordships allowed the appeal. The respondents must pay the appellant`s costs of and occasioned by the disciplinary proceedings and of the appeal to the Board.
Their Lordships have to record their deep disquiet that by a series of misjudgments the appellant and his co-accused Wong have suffered a grievous injustice. They have been fined, imprisoned and publicly disgraced for offences of which they were not guilty. The appellant, in addition, had been deprived of his seat in Parliament and disqualified for a year from practising his profession. Their Lordships` order restores him to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore, but because of the course taken by the criminal proceedings, their Lordships have no power to right the other wrongs which the appellant and Wong have suffered. Their only prospect of redress, their Lordships understand, will be by way of petition for pardon to the President of the Republic of Singapore.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 The four appellants were convicted of an offence under s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for committing robbery with hurt. They were each sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, with the imprisonment sentences backdated to 28 February 2003, the date they were first remanded. At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed the first, second and fourth appellants’ appeals against conviction and sentence and allowed the third appellant’s appeal. I now give my reasons.
Background
2          The complainant, Veerappan Durai (“Veerappan”), is an Indian national. He alleged that he was robbed and assaulted by six unidentified male Indians on 3 February 2003 at 11.00pm near Lorong 24 Geylang. He was robbed of a Nokia 8250 handphone (valued at $200), a gold chain (valued at $480) and $30 cash. He also alleged that he was hit on his head with a wooden pole from behind, and that he suffered punches on his forehead and left cheek.
3          On 26 February 2003, the police arrested the four appellants upon an informant’s information. An identification parade was conducted on the night of 27 February 2003 and Veerappan identified the four appellants. The two other unidentified men remain at large.
4          The first to fourth appellants, Govindaraj Perumalsamy, Ramaiah Guna Sekaran, Rathinam Manikandan and Soupramaniane D Jeamany respectively, are all Indian nationals. At the time of their arrests, the second and fourth appellants possessed special passes that enabled them to stay in Singapore, pending the outcome of their compensation claims for injuries suffered at work. However, the first and third appellants had overstayed. In the court below, they pleaded guilty to overstaying under s 15(3) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed). The first appellant also pleaded guilty to fraudulent possession of a work permit under s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed).
The Prosecution’s case
5          The Prosecution’s version of events was that Veerappan saw the four appellants walking towards him along Geylang Road near Lorong 24 as he was walking towards a bus stop to take a bus to Tekka (Serangoon Road). The first, second and fourth appellants approached Veerappan. The fourth appellant talked to him for five minutes before he pulled Veerappan’s shirt and demanded the latter’s gold chain and handphone. When Veerappan refused to comply, the fourth appellant punched him on the forehead and seized his handphone and $30 from his shirt pocket. The second appellant hit him with a wooden pole from behind while the first appellant punched him on his left cheek and snatched his gold chain.
6          Veerappan noticed that the first appellant wore one earring and had a bangle on his right hand. He also observed that the third appellant was standing 6 to 10m away and appeared to be a lookout. The remaining two unidentified men were standing 4 to 5m away. After the robbery and assault, Veerappan saw the first, second and fourth appellants running towards Lorong 24 Geylang while the third appellant ran away in another direction. The remaining two unidentified men had disappeared. Because these two men did not come to his assistance, Veerappan assumed that they were also involved.
7          Feeling dizzy after the assault, Veerappan sat on the ground to recover. After half an hour, he took a taxi home and recounted the events to his friend Sathiah. They then returned to the scene of the crime because Sathiah wanted to see the place. Thereafter, both of them went to Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a police report. The next day on 4 February 2003, Veerappan was examined by one Dr Pushparanee Somasundram. She testified that Veerappan told her that he had lost consciousness for an unknown duration after the assault and that he suffered injuries on his left thigh and on the left side of his face. She found that there was pain and tenderness on his left cheek as well as an abrasion on his left thigh.
The Defence
8          The crux of the four appellants’ defences was that of mistaken identity and denial that they were at the scene of the crime on the night in question. They also alleged that Veerappan identified them because he had seen them and their photographs before the identification parade. Save that the second and fourth appellants had met earlier at the same lawyer’s office regarding their compensation claims and a few more times after that, the four appellants denied knowing one another or Veerappan.
9          At the material time, the first appellant claimed that he was at a boarding house at Nos 4 and 6 Lorong 24 Geylang hiding from a police raid. The second appellant asserted that he was in his room in Hougang. The third appellant professed that he was with his friend Kannan at Tekka before they returned to their lodging at Lorong 30 Geylang. The fourth appellant testified that he was watching a 9.00pm movie, “Anbesivam”, at the Plaza Theatre in Jalan Sultan. After the movie ended at 12.30am, he only had enough money to take a taxi to Boon Lay MRT Station where he spent the night, before proceeding to his work quarters at Tuas in the morning.
10        All four appellants also averred that the identification parade was improperly conducted. Apparently, before the identification parade was conducted on the night of 27 February 2003, the appellants were brought to the investigating officer’s office that morning to swear on a Hindu deity. Later that evening, statements were recorded from them and their photographs were taken using a handphone and presumably shown to Veerappan, who was brought to see them in the investigating officer’s room. Thereafter, the identification parade was held, comprising eleven people of whom eight, including themselves, were Indian males while two were Malay males and one, a Chinese male. The appellants also claimed that everyone in the line up wore their own clothes during the parade.
The decision of the court below
11        The trial judge recognised that the case against the four appellants hinged on the testimony of the key prosecution witness, Veerappan, and his identification of the appellants. The trial judge found that Veerappan had made no mistake in identifying his assailants. He dismissed the Defence’s contention that convicting the appellants based solely on Veerappan’s testimony was unsafe because of the numerous inconsistencies and whimsical changes in Veerappan’s testimony. The trial judge held that Veerappan had no reason to frame the four appellants and that he was, on the whole, a truthful witness. The discrepancies in Veerappan’s testimony were not material and only reflected his honesty in narrating the events to the best of his recollection.
12        On the other hand, the trial judge disbelieved the defences of all four appellants and held that they had concocted their defences. He further disbelieved their allegations regarding the procedural irregularities that occurred before and during the identification parade.
Appeal against conviction
13        The appellants advanced three main contentions on appeal. First they alleged that the identification evidence was unreliable because the quality of the evidence was poor and because Veerappan was not a credible witness. Second, the identification evidence was said to be tainted because of alleged procedural irregularities that happened before and during the identification parade. Finally, the appellants claimed that the trial judge’s assessment of their credibility and that of various prosecution witnesses was flawed.
14        I shall now deal with each of these arguments in turn.
Whether the identification of the appellants was unreliable – quality of the evidence
15        The law on identification evidence was laid down in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
. In that case, the Court of Appeal adapted the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 into a three-step test as follows:
(a)        The first question that a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case concerning identification evidence is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the Defence to be unreliable.
(b)        If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made?
(c)        Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should go on to the third question. Is there any other evidence that goes to support the correctness of the identification?
16        As to the second question, the Court of Appeal suggested a non-exhaustive list of factors and circumstances that could be considered in assessing whether the identification evidence was of good quality. These included:
(a)        the length of time that the witness observed the accused;
(b)        the distance at which the observation was made;
(c)        the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation;
(d)        the number of times the witness saw the accused;
(e)        the frequency with which the witness saw the accused;
(f)         the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused;
(g)        the length of time which elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police; and
(h)        the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused.
17        At the third stage of the test, if the judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification, he should be mindful that a conviction based on such poor identification evidence would be unsafe.
18        Upon applying the three-step test, the trial judge was satisfied that the case against the appellants depended wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence. He then went on to consider whether the evidence was of good quality and concluded that the evidence was indeed of good quality for the following reasons:
(a)        Veerappan saw the faces of the first, second and fourth appellants clearly when they approached him. The third appellant was only 6 to 10m away and Veerappan also saw his face clearly when the third appellant looked at him during the robbery.
(b)        Though the lighting along the road was dim, it was sufficient for Veerappan to get a good look at his assailants during the encounter with them, which lasted several minutes. There were also no obstructions in his line of vision. Veerappan remembered clearly that the first appellant wore one earring and had a bangle.
(c)        Veerappan was unable to describe his assailants by their attire or characteristics but maintained that he could identify them by their faces. Subsequently, he did identify them at the identification parade on 27 February 2003. The fact that he did not identify anyone from an earlier parade on 19 February 2003 before the four appellants were caught, confirmed Veerappan’s ability to identify his assailants accurately.
(d)        The fact that the experience must have been a harrowing one for Veerappan meant that the faces of the assailants would be indelibly imprinted on his mind.
19        With regards to the first, second and fourth appellants, I was of the view that the trial judge’s reasons for holding the identification evidence to be of good quality were wholly sustainable. I have previously stated in 
PP v L (a minor)
 
[1999] 3 SLR 219
 that a victim of crime would naturally take a good look at his perpetrator and commit his face to memory. This was undoubtedly the case here, especially since Veerappan had the opportunity to see his three assailants at close range for a few minutes before and during the incident. Although Veerappan testified that he later felt dizzy from the assault, it is pertinent to note that he had already looked intently at the three of them before his vision or memory was impaired in any conceivable way.
20        On the contrary, I found that Veerappan’s identification suffered from certain weaknesses with respect to the third appellant. First of all, Veerappan testified that as his assailants approached him, the third appellant was looking down and he was a distance behind the first and second appellants, who were in turn walking behind the fourth appellant. Since the third appellant was right at the back of the group and he was looking down, Veerappan could not have seen his face before the incident, especially since the road was not brightly lit.
21        Second, Veerappan testified that during the incident, the third appellant was standing about 6 to 10m away. Veerappan noticed that the third appellant was looking down though he also claimed that he saw the latter look at him. I was unconvinced by Veerappan’s version of events in this regard. Since the robbery and assault took place simultaneously, it was most incredible that Veerappan would be able to get a good look at a man standing 6 to 10m away, whilst he was desperately trying to prevent his possessions from being snatched and whilst he was being struck by a wooden pole on the back of his head and receiving punches on his forehead and left cheek. It was clear to me that he could not have looked at the person whom he claimed to be the third appellant for more than a few seconds under such circumstances let alone take a good look at him.
22        Third, the nub of the third appellant’s involvement, as alleged by Veerappan, was that he acted as a lookout, as evinced by his taking flight from the scene after the incident, albeit alone and in a different direction from the other three appellants. The fact that the third appellant did not come to Veerappan’s aid also indicated to him that the third appellant was in cahoots with the other three appellants. In court, Veerappan testified that he felt dizzy upon being attacked and had to sit on the ground but he never lost consciousness. He also averred that he never told Dr Pushparanee Somasundram that he had lost consciousness. However, his testimony was contradicted by the doctor, who testified that Veerappan had indeed told her so. She had also duly noted what he had told her in his medical report.
23        Since it is uncertain if Veerappan had indeed lost consciousness and, if so, for how long and at which point in time, there was a reasonable doubt as to whether he saw the third appellant fleeing the scene. Even if he was merely giddy, as he claimed in court, his vision or memory could have been impaired and his identification of the third appellant as the person fleeing the scene could be a mistake, especially since there would have been a flurry of activity all around him as his attackers fled. The fact that the two other unidentified men whom Veerappan claimed were also involved, had vanished without his notice, showed that he was not as alert and observant as he professed to be.
24       
 
Additionally, Veerappan only identified the four appellants 24 days after the incident. Under such nebulous circumstances whereby Veerappan claimed to have seen the third appellant, the time lapse rendered the quality of the identification evidence even more suspect. As such, I found that Veerappan’s observations of the third appellant were made in circumstances which only allowed identification evidence of poor quality. Accordingly, this was a situation where the trial judge’s finding, that the quality of the identification evidence with regards to the third appellant was good, was clearly against the weight of the evidence. I should also add that just because the trial judge found Veerappan to be a truthful witness did not automatically mean that the court should rely on all of his evidence, bearing in mind human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection.
25        Following 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 ([15] 
supra
), since the identification evidence of the third appellant was of poor quality, I proceeded to ascertain if there was supporting evidence, which need not be corroboration evidence of the kind required by 
R v Baskerville
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
. All that was required was evidence that would make me sure that there was no mistake in the identification.
26        In the court below, the trial judge had dismissed the third appellant’s defence as concocted because his testimony in court differed from the account rendered in his two police statements. In his statements, the third appellant merely said that he could not remember where he was, neither could he confirm whom he was with on the night in question. Yet at trial, the third appellant testified that he was with one “Kannan” on the night in question. They had gone to Tekka and Cuff Road before returning to Lorong 30 Geylang. In this regard, I noted the salutary caution of Lord Widgery CJ in 
R v Turnbull
 ([15] 
supra
), where he said at 230 of his judgment:
Care should be taken by the judge when directing the jury about the support for an identification which may be derived from the fact that they have rejected an alibi. False alibis may be put forward for many reasons: an accused, for example, who has only his own truthful evidence to rely on may stupidly fabricate an alibi and get lying witnesses to support it out of fear that his own evidence will not be enough. Further, alibi witnesses can make genuine mistakes about dates and occasions like any other witnesses can. It is only when the jury is satisfied that the sole reason for the fabrication was to deceive them and there is no other explanation for its being put forward can fabrication provide any support for identification evidence. The jury should be reminded that proving the accused has told lies about where he was at the material time does not by itself prove that he was where the identifying witness says he was.
27        I found this point to be germane in the present case. Although the trial judge disbelieved the third appellant’s alibi, this certainly did not by itself prove that the third appellant was at the scene of the crime. As I previously noted in 
Simon Joseph v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 196
, an accused’s conviction should not be upheld merely because his defence was disbelieved by the trial judge.
28        I was not satisfied that the sole reason for the third appellant’s fabrication was to deceive the court and that there could be no other explanation for its being put forward. The Prosecution’s case also contained no more than veiled references to the third appellant’s presence at the scene of the crime at the material time and the Prosecution had failed to adduce affirmative evidence that pointed ineluctably to the guilt of the third appellant. Accordingly, it was clear to me that there was no other supporting evidence for the poor quality identification evidence.
Whether the identification of the appellants was unreliable – Veerappan’s credibility
29        Since the entire case hinged on the evidence given by Veerappan, this appeal naturally centred on highlighting discrepancies in his testimony. The appellants contended that Veerappan’s testimony contained overwhelming inconsistencies, of which the main discrepancies were as follows:
(a)        Veerappan said during his examination-in-chief that the offence took place at a bus stop along Lorong 24 Geylang where he waited five minutes for a bus. Under cross-examination, he said that the offence took place as he was walking along Lorong 24 towards a bus stop at Lorong 20 instead.
(b)        The timings that Veerappan gave in his police report were inconsistent with his testimony in court. His recollection of time pertaining to his medical examination and the identification parade also differed from the time proffered by Dr Pushparanee Somasundram (“PW9”) and the Investigating Officer, Sergeant Razali Rahmat (“PW2”).
(c)        PW2 testified that Veerappan told him that the fourth appellant assaulted him with the bangle and robbed him of his gold chain, handphone and cash. However, Veerappan testified that the first appellant wore the bangle and snatched his gold chain.
(d)        At trial, Veerappan said that he only felt dizzy after the assault but he never lost consciousness. However, PW9 said that Veerappan had told her that he had lost consciousness.
(e)        Veerappan testified that he spoke in Tamil to a Tamil officer at the police station, who acted as an interpreter to the recording officer. However, the recording officer, Sergeant Syed Az-Zameer bin Abdul Rahim (“PW7”) asserted that there was no interpreter used in recording the report. PW7 said that Veerappan related the incident to him in simple English and used hand gestures.
(f)         The gold chain that was taken from Veerappan was a gift from his friend, Murugesan Kulenthaivelu (“PW3”). Veerappan testified that he was given the chain four months after his 28th birthday. However, PW3 said that he had given Veerappan the gold chain six months before his 28th birthday.
30        Even if a few of these inconsistencies appeared to be material, it is trite law that a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness. On this point, my observation in 
Lewis Christine v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 165
, that innocent discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies, bears remembrance. Given that the four appellants did not know Veerappan and that Veerappan had no reason to frame them, the discrepancies in Veerappan’s testimony did not seem to be deliberate lies.
31        Furthermore, the trial judge had been mindful that there were inconsistencies in Veerappan’s evidence but, having weighed them against the totality of the evidence, he nonetheless accepted Veerappan’s evidence on the key facts in issue. It is settled law that the trial judge is entitled to determine which part of a witness’s testimony remains credible despite its discrepancies and there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. Reference may be made to the cases of 
Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 205
 and 
Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 344
.
32        These discrepancies also did not detract from the fact that the trial judge found Veerappan to be a reliable and honest witness. As I observed in 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
, the court recognises and accepts that human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is oftentimes inevitable in weighing the evidence of a witness. I agreed with the trial judge that Veerappan was a truthful witness on the whole and it seemed to me that any inaccuracies in his recollection or perception showed his over-zealousness as a witness rather than any dishonesty on his part. In my view, the discrepancies in Veerappan’s evidence were not so material that they diminished the value of the identification evidence or warranted interference with the trial judge’s findings on Veerappan’s credibility.
Whether the alleged procedural irregularities that occurred before and during the identification parade tainted the identification evidence
33        The appellants declared that the identification evidence should be rejected because Veerappan saw them and their photographs before the identification parade. They also claimed that the parade was conducted unfairly as the line-up included persons of different races and attire. Upon an assessment of the witnesses’ veracity, the trial judge disbelieved the appellants’ bare allegations and preferred PW2’s and Staff Sergeant Karapaya s/o Arumugam’s version of events, namely, that Veerappan did not have sight of the appellants or their photographs before the parade and the persons in the line-up were all Indian men wearing lock-up attire.
34        It was apparent to me that the trial judge’s findings should not be disturbed. After all, I have made it clear in 
Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP
 that due weight should be accorded to a trial judge’s assessment of a witness’s credibility based on demeanour in court, given that the trial judge has had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the particular witnesses.
35        Furthermore, this was not a situation where the trial judge simply believed one party’s words over another’s upon assessing the witnesses’ veracity but it was one where he had the added benefit of perusing credible evidence given by PW2. At trial, PW2 had produced a precise and detailed list of the suspects who were involved in the identification parade. Juxtaposing PW2’s evidence against the appellants’ bare assertions rendered the hollowness of the appellants’ words even more obvious. As such, the trial judge’s findings, that the alleged procedural irregularities never occurred and that the identification evidence was not tainted, did not go against the weight of the evidence.
Whether the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the appellants and various prosecution witnesses was flawed
36        With regard to the appellants’ credibility, counsel for the appellants claimed that the trial judge had not been objective in assessing their credibility and had rejected their defences because of minor discrepancies. While the trial judge found that the third appellant’s defence had been invented as an afterthought, he held that the evidence of the first, second and fourth appellants were contradicted both internally and by independent witnesses.
37        Cases like 
PP v Victor Rajoo
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
 and 
Simon Joseph v PP
 ([17] 
supra
) have stated uncontroversially that a finding on a witness’s credibility should be tested against objective facts and evidence. The trial judge here had undertaken a detailed assessment of the evidence and considered the evidence in its entirety, ensuring that his findings on the four appellants’ credibility were tested against independent evidence given by credible witnesses such as PW2, Subramaniam s/o Letchman Chitty (“PW4”), Tan Tiong Seng (“PW6”) and Inspector Jeremy Tang (“PW10”). Therefore, he was entitled to place little or no weight on the appellants’ evidence.
38        Unsurprisingly, the appellants also sought to cast doubt on the veracity of PW4 and PW6 who, the appellants claimed, had overriding self-interests in the matter. Both witnesses’ interests lay in guarding themselves against offences for harbouring or employing an overstayer or for being an undeclared employer of a foreign national. PW4 is the owner of the Hougang flat where the second appellant claimed he was on the night in question, while PW6 is the owner of the boarding house where the first appellant claimed to have taken refuge on the night in question. However, both PW4 and PW6 flatly denied that the second and first appellants were respectively where they claimed to be that night.
39        In the circumstances, the second appellant’s stay in Singapore was legal since he had a special pass, which he had shown to PW4. Hence, PW4 would have no reason to lie about the second appellant’s whereabouts on the night in question. Counsel pounced on the fact that PW4 had contradicted himself as to when he first saw the second appellant, arguing that this inconsistency proved that PW4 had something to hide. My response to this is to reiterate my observation in 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP

, that so long as the inconsistencies in a witness’s evidence were minor in nature, or related to minor issues, it did not undermine his evidence in respect of the key issues. To my mind, the discrepancy in PW4’s evidence was decidedly minor and should not be allowed to undermine the material facts in his evidence.
40        As for PW6, his evidence was consistent with that of PW10. Coupled with the material inconsistencies in the first appellant’s evidence, there was no reason for the trial judge to doubt PW6’s testimony. Moreover, even if PW4 and PW6 were indeed interested witnesses, it has been established in 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 that a witness’s evidence need not be treated with unnecessary caution simply because he has some self-interest in the matter. In this case, the trial judge had reached his findings after a thorough examination of the situation and upon testing his impression as to the demeanour of the various witnesses against the whole of the evidence. As such, I found no reason to disturb his findings.
41        I now turn to the appeal against sentence.
Appeal against sentence
42        The appellants’ appeals against sentence were without merit. They had failed to raise any specific grounds for their appeals against sentence, which seemed to be a tacit recognition on their part that the sentence passed by the trial judge was not manifestly excessive. In 
Loh Khoon Hai v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 321
, I had stated that the tariff sentence for an offence under s 394 of the Penal Code is six years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, which was the sentence meted out to the four appellants here. The trial judge had also properly considered all the circumstances of the case and the sentence could not be said to be manifestly excessive.
Conclusion
43        For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the first, second and fourth appellants’ appeals against conviction and sentence. As for the third appellant, it cannot be said that the evidence was so compelling that his conviction could be based solely on it. I was satisfied that such a conviction would be unsafe and thus allowed the third appellant’s appeal.
 
First, second and fourth appellants’ appeal against conviction and sentence dismissed.
 Third appellant’s appeal allowed.",2004-02-04 00:00:00,SG High Court

The accused is charged before us on the following charge: 
 
You Ramasamy a/l Sebastian, M/37 yrs
 
 
 
Nric No: 7722183-FOM
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about the 30th day of November 1987, at about 11.26pm, at Room B-11 of the workmen`s quarters at the MRT Project No 305, Koh Sek Lim Road, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Neelamegam a/l Karupian, male 36 years, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code Cap 224.
 
 
 
Evidence led by the prosecution is this. At the relevant time both the accused and Neelamegam (the deceased) were working for a sub-contractor of Hyundai Construction at the MRT project No 305 worksite at Koh Sek Lim Road. Both of them together with two others, Muniandy a/l Annamalai and Rajendran a/l Paramasivan (who worked for another sub-contractor), shared the same cubicle, No B-11, on the second level of the temporary quarters erected at the said site.
On the morning of 30 November 1987 all four men left for work. Rajendran (PW9) and Muniandy (PW8) returned after their work at about 9.10pm. Then the accused and Neelamegam had already returned: Neelamegam was cooking and the accused was sitting on a bunk in the cubicle having a drink. The accused was also smoking. Muniandy helped Neelamegam by going down to fetch a pail of water. Thereafter Muniandy went to take his bath. Upon his return Neelamegam and Rajendran went to take their bath. The last to do so was the accused. In the meantime, while Rajendran and Neelamegam were having their bath, the accused gave Muniandy $10 to buy drinks from a mobile vendor at the site. Muniandy bought a big bottle of ABC Stout, a can of ABC Stout and a small bottle of 3-star wine (320ml).
At about 10.25pm to 10.30pm, they began to consume the drinks. The accused drank the big bottle of ABC stout, Rajendran and Neelamegam shared the bottle of 3-star wine and Muniandy consumed the can of stout. It was at this time that the four of them sat down on the floor to play a card game called `throop`, with Rajendran (PW9) partnering the accused and Muniandy (PW8) partnering Neelamegam. When the first game was over Neelamegam counted the cards of his as well as his partner`s (Muniandy`s) and said that they had won. The accused, not being satisfied, counted his and Rajendran`s cards and said instead that they had won. The two started to quarrel but was stopped from quarrelling further by Muniandy.
Notwithstanding this dispute they carried on and played a second game. While the second game was still not completed, the accused placed his cards on the floor, got up and went to the stove and took some food and placed it on a plate. He started eating. When he was about to sit on the floor to resume the game Neelamixed up all the cards. The accused, seemingly annoyed, asked Neelamegam why he did that. In reply, Neelamegam remarked, `Are you going to play with a hand soiled with curry?` They again argued with each other. At that point both Muniandy and Rajendran joined in to say that perhaps they should stop the game and everyone should have their meal. Nevertheless, the accused and Neelamegam continued to argue and quarrel with each other. This lasted for about 20 minutes. When they stopped the card game everyone had consumed their drinks except for the accused, who had some drink left in the cup; the stout bottle was, however, empty. At a certain point of their argument, the accused went out of the cubicle to urinate but soon returned. At that moment, Muniandy was having his meal sitting on floor. The accused scolded him and asked how it was that Neelamegam had mixed up all the cards. Neelamegam intervened and said that the quarrel was between him and the accused and had nothing to do with Muniandy. The accused repeatedly harped on the question on the mixing of the cards and Neelamegam replied that `you are always like that when you have drinks.` Both of them quarrelled further. At that point in time Rajendran was seated on the bunk smoking and looking out of the window. Then the accused was heard to have said that he would stab Neelamegam. Rajendran turned his head back and saw the accused taking a knife from the rack and with his left arm caught hold of Neelamegam by his forehead and with his right hand stabbed Neelamegam with the knife twice in the left shoulder region close to the neck. Rajendran quickly went forward to try to wrench the knife from the accused`s right han d. The accused had then stabbed Neelamegam a third time. Rajendran caught hold of the accused`s right hand and told him to drop the knife; but he refused so much so that Rajendran had to punch him three times before he could wrench the knife from the accused. Rajendran placed the knife on the stove. Muniandy who had also stopped eating, came forward to help Neelamegam and asked Rajendran to call for an ambulance.
The ambulance arrived at about 11.30pm. The ambulance officer (PW5) and the ambulance attendant (PW2) went straight up to cubicle No B-11. Neelawas lying on his back with his head resting on a pillow. The accused was lying by the side of Neelawith half of his body covering the left side of Neelamegam`s body. After some persuasion, the accused got up from that lying position. He got up on his own without any difficulty, though according to the ambulance attendant he was swaying from side to side. The ambulance attendant also said that his breath smelled of alcohol. The ambulance officer then examined Neelamegam. By then there was no heart-beat and no respiration. She bandaged the three stab wounds and pronounced Neelamegam dead at 11.40pm.
When the accused got up from the lying position, the ambulance officer heard him to have said in Tamil words which mean `I stabbed him with a knife. I stabbed him in anger. Take me away. One must go to the gallows if one has killed.` These words were uttered spontaneously by the accused without any prompting by anyone. According to the ambulance officer, the accused had no difficulty in getting up from the lying down position although after that he appeared a little restless pacing back and forth. The accused was not vomitting and neither did he pass out. There is no evidence that he was unable to control his urine or faeces. Muniandy also said he heard the accused saying something when he got up from the laying position but he could not remember what was said. Rajendran said that after the accused got up the latter scolded Rajendran to the effect that `you were the one who took knife from me. Your finger prints are on the knife. You are also involved. You punched me and Muniandy is a witness.`
At about 11.45pm, the police arrived. PC Sim Kok Kian (PW6) met the ambulance officer (PW5) and three Indian persons, ie the accused, Muniandy, and Rajendran at the corridor outside cubicle B-11. When PC Sim saw the accused the latter said something to PC Sim and at the same time also offered both his hands to PC Sim. PC Sim said that the accused`s breath smelled of alcohol. PC Sim, accompanied by PC Soh Eng Seng (PW7), brought the accused down to the ground level by holding the accused`s elbow but he was not supporting the accused as the accused could walk very steadily. The accused did not stumble; neither was his speech slurred. Thereafter he was placed in the police vehicle.PC Soh also said that the accused walked to the car steadily though the accused`s breath smelled of liquor. At no time during the period when he was waiting in the vehicle did the accused fall asleep; neither did he vomit in the vehicle.
Inspector Lim Kwang Meng (now of the rank of ASP) of the Special Investigation Section, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), arrived at the scene of crime at about 12.55am on 1 December 1987. Having completed his investigations, he brought the accused back to the CID, arriving at the CID at 3.30am. Inspector Lim informed the accused that he had been arrested for the murder of Neelamegam. At 4.05am, Inspector Lim instructed Cpl Chng Leng Hock and PC Low Peng Yeong to escort the accused to the General Hospital for a medical examination. He was examined for, among other things, alcoholic intoxication. On this aspect, the doctor found that there was no smell of alcohol in his breath; his speech was not slurred; his heart and chest were normal; his abdomen was soft and his gait was steady. His blood taken at that time showed 71mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. The accused was brought back to Inspector Lim at his office at 5am.
The accused gave his first statement to Inspector Lim at 5.05am to 6.15am. That was the s 122(6) statement. Subsequently, on 2 December 1987, the accused gave a s 122(5) statement to Inspector Lim. That was followed by two further statements on 4 December 1987 and 5 December 1987. The accused challenged the admissibility of all the four statements on the ground that it was procured by inducement or promise. There is no allegation that he was assaulted while in police custody. There is no allegation that any threat of force was brought to bear upon him.
 Trial within a trial 
The prosecution sought to admit in evidence the four statements made by the accused. The four statements were marked for identification purposes as P35I, P44I, P45I and P46I. A trial-within-a-trial to determine the admissibility of the four statements was held.
In relation to the s 122(6) statement the accused alleged that at the time when he was giving the statement he felt hungry and giddy. He said he told the Inspector about his hunger though he could not remember whether or not he told the Inspector that he did not have his dinner yet the previous night.
In relation to all the four statements the main complaint of the accused was that the statements were not given voluntarily as they were given on account of inducement or promise held out by both Inspector Lim (PW10) and the interpreter, Mrs Jaya Letchumi (PW 13). Inspector Lim was alleged to have told the accused, through the interpreter, that if he should admit to the offence, he would receive a reduced sentence.
There was also another complaint to the effect that during the recording of the s 122(5) statements, Inspector Lim had repeatedly warned the accused in Malay that he should tell the truth and not lies (
 jangan cakap bohong, cakap betul betul 
or words to that effect). The accused also alleged that, when the second s 122(5) statement was recorded, Mrs Letchumi had said, `You better tell the truth.` The accused also said that in relation to all the three s 122(5) statements no warning was administered to him before recording commenced.
Inspector Lim told the court that at no time prior to the recording of the s 122(6) statement did the accused inform him that he was hungry. From his investigation at the scene of crime he had the impression or was given to understand the accused had his dinner. He said that there was nothing in the conduct of the accused which would lead him to believe that the accused was not fit to give a statement. Inspector Lim agreed that if he, in fact, was told that the accused had his last meal at 12 noon the previous day he would probably have got food for him first before recording the statement. But he emphasized that at no time did the accused tell or complain to him that he was hungry or dizzy. Mrs Letchumi, the interpreter who was present when recording of all the four statements took place, said that when the recording of the s 122(6) was made the accused appeared all right although she could not now remember if the accused was dizzy or restless. In our mind it is most unlikely that a person who has just killed another and who is facing a capital charge would be concerned about hunger if he was in fact hungry. We, therefore, reject this allegation.
Inspector Lim told the court that in respect of the s 122(6) statement, the accused volunteered it after the warning was administered to him and interpreted by Mrs Letchumi. It was recorded precisely as narrated by the accused through the interpreter.
Both Inspector Lim and Mrs Letchumi were emphatic in denying that any promise or inducement was uttered in the course of their recording of the four statements. Inspector Lim said that the accused had been very cooperative and Mrs Letchumi said that the accused was forthright in his answers. On the other hand, the testimony of the accused before us as to the events relating to the recording of the statements is to say the least, vague and in some instances, confusing. Many things he could not remember yet he was sure that the promise of a reduced sentence was made. We find that there was really no need for Inspector Lim or the interpreter to make any such promise and none was proffered. The accused was cooperative; in all probabihe was very remorseful of what happened the previous night. We find that he voluntarily gave the statements to the investigating officer who duly recorded what he said.
As regards the allegation that Inspector Lim told him in Malay to tell the truth, (
 jangan cakap bohong, cakap betul betul 
or words to that effect), we find that even if that allegation be true, which is denied by Inspector Lim, we do not see how that expression as such could amount to a threat or inducement. The accused was not able to give details of the context in which this Malay expression was used which would show in that context it could amount to a threat or an inducement. In our view, the fact that a police officer reminds a witness that he should tell the truth and not tell lies cannot, in truth, constitute a threat or an inducement. But even if it could be construed to amount to a threat or inducement, we find that in the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement that utterance did not really have any effect on the accused`s willingness to give the statement. The evidence shows that this utterance was not made prior to the giving of a statement but in the course of the giving of the statement. The accused was not, in fact, induced by that utterance to think that by giving that statement he would gain any advantage of a temporal nature.
Again, as regards the allegation that Mrs Letchumi had told him `You better tell the truth`, Mrs Letchumi has, on re-examination, clarified that what she told him was that he should tell the truth. We are aware that some cases have held that utterances like, `you better tell the truth` could amount to a threat or inducement. But we would make this observation. It seems clear to us that the interpreter uttered this advice in the course of recording the statement from the accused. We do not think that such words used in the circumstances of the present case are sufficient to suggest to the accused that he was going to gain any advantage by giving the statement. We held that this utterance does not render any of the three s 122(5) statements involuntary.
Turning to the allegation that no warning was administered to the accused prior to the commencement of recording of the s 122(5) statements, here we accept the evidence of Inspector Lim and Mrs Letchumi that a warning was administered to the accused when the statement was recorded on 3 December 1987. This is clearly shown on p 1 of P44I. Inspector Lim and Mrs Letchumi agreed that they did not administer the warning again on 4 and 5 December 1987. However, we do not think that is necessary as the further statements of 4 and 5 December 1987 were a continuation of the first statement.
There were in addition a couple of other minor allegations, eg he was refused a cigarette, thus causing hardship to the accused; he was given a cigarette at the end of the recording, thus suggesting inducement. In our view, these are entirely inconsequential and had no effect whatsoever on the voluntariness of the statements made by the accused. Accordingly, we admitted all the four statements.
In his s 122(6) statement the accused stated the following: 
 
I went to take my bath after returning from work. After the bath, I changed into my sarong and sat in the room to have a drink. We then decided to play English cards. Muniandy, Neelamegam, Rajah and myself took part in the game. As we were playing we also drank. Muniandy and I drank stout while the other two drank brandy. I then stopped playing and went to take my dinner. The others teased me for not continuing with the game. We usually joke and make fun of each other and as such I did not take it seriously. As I was helping myself with the food, Neelaapproached me and was still joking and teasing me for backing out of the game. I then told Neelamegam not to shout. I jokingly told him that I would stab him with the knife which I had already held in my hand. I did not know what happened next and the next moment when I hugged him I realized that Neelamegam was bleeding and my hands were stained with blood. I then put him on my lap and I cried. I gave the knife to Rajah. Sometime later, the ambulance arrived and the ambulance staff consoled me. I gave my passport to the ambulance staff and was told to give it to the police. I admit committing the offence and I am remorseful for that. I did not do it deliberately. According to my conscience I know that I have not committed a serious crime. I am willing to accept the punishment. There was no animosity between Neelamegam and myself. I ask for leniency.
 
 
 
In his s 122(5) statement made on 3 December 1987 the following was said: 
 
On 30 November 1987 (Monday) at about 9pm, Megam and I finished our work. Megam is now the deceased. Both of us worked at the `casting area` at the MRT Project No 305 worksite off Koh Sek Lim Road, Changi. Before going up to our cubicle which was `B11` on the upper level of the two-level workmen`s quarters located at the same worksite, we bought two packets of fresh chicken and one half-bottle of 3-star brandy (red wine) from a mobile provision supplier who drove a panel van. I contributed $5 and the deceased contributed $3 to pay for the brandy. The purchase of the chickens was on credit. We then went up to our cubicle. The deceased began to cook dinner and we also consumed the brandy. I was seated on the raised platform in the cubicle.
 
 
 
The cubicle was occupied by four of us, ie the deceased, myself and two other male Indians. They were Muniandy and Rajendran. Both of them also worked at the same worksite and we have stayed together for about one year. We also contributed equally to buy provisions and Muniandy took charge of the expenditure. Muniandy and the deceased also took charge of the cooking which was done inside our cubicle.
 
 
 
On the same day, sometime past 9pm, Muniandy and Rajendran also returned from their work. By the time they returned, the deceased and I had already consumed the bottle of brandy except for some in a glass which I was holding. Shortly, the deceased and Rajendran went for their bath at the bathroom which was located behind the canteen. The canteen was located next to our quarters. When both of them were gone, I gave $10 to Muniandy and asked him to buy some more liquor from the same provision supplier. I then left to take my bath. The deceased and Rajendran after their bath returned to the cubicle. I returned after my bath. I saw one can and one bottle of ABC stout and a half-bottle of 3-Star brandy in the cubicle.
 
 
 
The deceased and Rajendran suggested to play `Throop` with English playing cards. It is an Indian card. Muniandy and I agreed and we sat on the floor to play the game. The cubicle was lit with three candles. We often play `Throop` to pass time and no cash was used as stakes each time. On this occasion, we also consumed liquor while playing the game. Muniandy and I consumed the stout while Rajendran and the deceased consumed the brandy. In the game, I partnered Rajendran while the deceased paired off with Muniandy. After a few rounds, I decided to quit as I was feeling hungry. I then threw down the cards and called it quits. I then walked out of the cubicle and proceeded to the toilet to ease myself. Shortly I returned and as I entered the cubicle, the deceased remarked that I should not play cards anymore. I then replied to the deceased that if he stop, I would also stop and if he plays again, I also can play and while replying to the deceased, I was walking to the cooking platform as I wanted to take my food. The deceased also approached me from my rear. I saw a knife lying on a plate placed on the cooking platform. I took the knife with my right hand and at the same time turned to face the deceased who had come close. The deceased held me tight with both his hands around my body and I plunged the knife onto the left side of deceased`s neck and at the same time, I held his head against my chest with my left hand. I cannot remember how many times did I stab the deceased. I saw my right hand spattered with blood and I heard Rajendran shouted to me to give him the knife. Immediately, I gave him the knife and at the same time, Rajendran punched me once on my lips. I saw blood oozing from the deceased`s neck and I used my right palm to cover the wound to stop the bleeding. I also shouted to Rajendran not to beat me but to call for an ambulance. I was still holding the deceased then still on his feet. Rajendran and Muniandy then left the cubicle and I believed that they had gone to call for the ambulance. I could feel that the deceased`s body was going soft and sagging onto the floor and finally, I laid him to rest on his back. Both my hands were still wrapped round deceased`s neck and while doing so, my upper body also rested on the deceased`s chest as I was in a prostrate position. I knew that the deceased was badly injured as he was motionless. I cried. I stabbed the deceased earlier because when he approached me I feared that he would harm me.
 
 
 
Shortly, someone tapped me on my back and asked me to move away. I looked up and saw the female ambulance officer. I then got up and the ambulance officer attended to the deceased. I also produced my passport to the ambulance officer who told me to hand it to the police. I then went out to the passage-way and the police arrived. I told one of the police officers that `I killed him. Please arrest me`. Following this, I was handcuffed and led away. I was asked to sit at the rear of a police car parked near our quarters. I was only clad in a green sarong and it was stained with blood.
 
 
 
Later in the morning, I was taken to CID. Insp Lim then told me that I have been arrested for the murder of the deceased. I then realized that Megam had died. On 2 December 1987, I was charged in court for murder.
 
 
 
Dr Wee Keng Poh, the pathologist who performed an autopsy on the deceased, found that there were three stab wounds at the left shoulder near the base of the neck. The first wound, which penetrated the lung, was the fatal wound. The other two wounds were also potentially fatal as they cut the internal jugular veins; the person would die in a matter of minutes. No defensive or other injuries were found on the deceased. Dr Wee said that the condition of the three wounds were consistent with the stabbing as described by Rajendran. The wounds were fairly well coordinated.
Dr Wee Keng Poh said that taking into account the fact that at the time when the accused was brought to the Singapore General Hospital for a medical examination at 4.36am his blood alcohol level was 71mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood, he was of the view that the accused`s blood alcohol level at the time of the offence would be in the region of 120 to 170mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood. On the assumption that the accused is an experienced drinker and relying on authorities which he produced in court, Dr Wee was of the opinion, taking into account the fact situation which was presented to him, that the alcohol effect on the accused would have been slight. Dr Wee also opined that for an experienced drinker the rate of oxidization in the body is higher. If there is food in the stomach then the absorption process will also be slowed down.
The prison psychiatrist, Dr Chan Kim Yew (PW15), examined the accused on 18 and 20 April 1990 at Changi Prison Hospital. From his examination he was of the opinion that the accused is not an alcoholic but an experienced social drinker. Based on deduction he would put the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the offence at between 150-170mg per 100 ml. At that level the accused would be under the influence of alcohol, which means that the accused would experience some euphoria, impairment of fine motor coordination and perhaps instability of mood. But his capacity to form intention would be intact. Thought process would only be affected at the level of 200 and above. Having perused P44, P45 and P46, he said that the details given therein show that the person has a good recollection of events. If the accused had been intoxicated to a high level then his mind would not have registered the events; there would have been nothing to commit to memory.
On P35, Dr Chan said that it shows someone who could give a good account of his own actions as well as others` though it also shows that the person seems to have amnesia for the critical period of ten seconds or so when the stabbing took place. In his view it was most unlikely that the accused could have suffered from alcoholic amnesia for a brief moment like ten seconds, as normally amnesia would extend from hours to days. In his view, in the context of the effect of alcohol consumption, actual behaviour is the best indicator to determine whether alcohol has affected the brain, and not so much the blood alcohol level. Looking at the wounds inflicted on the deceased, Dr Chan said that they were not random slashes or stabs. Considering the situation as a whole he was of the view that the accused was unlikely to be deeply intoxicated.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, counsel for the accused made a rather meek submission of no case to answer on the ground that the accused had no intention to kill the deceased. In our view, the prosecution has made out a case on the charge against the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. We accordingly called upon the accused to make his defence. The two courses were explained to him and he elected to give evidence on oath.
 Defence 
The accused`s evidence is that on the day in question he returned to the cubicle between 8pm to 8.30pm. On his way he met Neelamegam who asked him to buy drinks from the mobile vendor. The accused gave Neelamegam $5 and together with some of his own money, Neelamegam bought a big bottle of 3-star Chinese wine. They returned to the cubicle and Neelamegam began to prepare food for cooking. In the meantime the accused took out two glasses and poured the 3-star wine into them. According to the accused, he drank more than half the bottle of that wine. Having consumed the wine, the accused threw the empty bottle into the rubbish pail. He then carried the pail out to dispose of the rubbish. Soon thereafter Muniandy and Rajendran returned. Sometime later, the accused handed $10 to Muniandy and asked him to buy a big bottle of ABC Stout and use the remainder of the money for whatever other drinks Muniandy might wish to purchase. Thereafter the accused went for his bath.
On his way back from the bath, he passed the canteen where some Thai workers were drinking. The accused said the Thai workers asked him to join them and they poured him a glass of drink which to him tasted like the 3-star wine. He consumed the drink and then returned to the cubicle. By then, Muniandy had bought a big bottle of ABC stout, a can of ABC stout and half a bottle of the3-star wine. His friends then asked him to join them in a game of cards. The accused partnered Rajendran and Muniandy partnered Neelamegam. After one or two games, the accused got up and went to the cooking area and took two or three pieces of chicken from the pot to eat. Upon returning he found that the others had shuffled the cards without counting the points. He said that Neelamegam called him a drunkard and that Neelamegam accused him of behaving like that after drinks. They then stopped playing cards. The accused went out of the cubicle to ease himself at the staircase landing. He said he did not go down the staircase to the toilet because he was unsteady.
On his return to the cubicle Neelamegam said to the accused that the latter should not play cards any more; but the accused replied that he would play. The accused then wanted to eat and he took a plate which was on the top shelf. A knife was on the plate. He took the knife from the plate intending to insert it into the rack between the shelf and the wall which was the usual place where they kept their knives. At that moment he was not facing Neelamegam but the wall. He felt someone grabbing him from behind. He said that the next thing he knew was that he saw a blood-stained knife in his hand. He thought he had stabbed Neelamegam. He tried to catch hold of Neelamegam but could not do so as Neelamegam was slowly collapsing as the latter was bigger in size than the accused. Both of them then sat on the floor. The accused said that he had no intention whatsoever to inflict any injuries on Neelamegam as the four of them were like brothers.
The accused said that all that happened because he was drunk. That day he drank more than half a bottle of 3-star wine, then a glass of drink offered by the Thai workers and finally a big bottle of ABC stout. However, the accused maintained that he was and is not an alcoholic.
When he was confronted with P35, P44, P45 and P46 where he gave details of how the events happened that night, the accused explained that all those were events reconstructed and suggested to him by the Inspector and the interpreter. They would not believe him when he said that he did not know. As regards the identification of the knife, only one blood-stained knife was shown to him and he had to say that that was the knife.
When it was put to him that in all his statements to the police, he had never mentioned about the Thai workers offering him a glass of drink, he explained that the police never asked him about that. He admitted that the interpreter could have interpreted the warning to him when he gave the s 122(6) statement. But he could not remember whether he did say to Neelamegam that `I will `kuttu` you.` Neither could he remember whether or not he told Rajendran that `your finger-prints are on the knife and you are involved.`
Assoc Professor Edmund Lee (DW2) of the Pharmacology Department of the National University of Singapore was called by the defence to establish the probable blood alcohol level in the accused at the time of the offence and on how that level of intoxication would have affected the accused. He used two methods. One is based on the quantity consumed by the accused as stated by the accused to the court. The second method is to work backwards based on the blood alcohol level in the accused at 4.36am the following morning. The first method assumes the accuracy of the quantity of alcohol consumed as claimed by the accused. The second method is dependent primarily on one variable factor - the rate of oxidization and the range is between 15mg and 40mg per hour per 100 ml of blood. He said traditionally it was thought that for a normal person the rate would be 15mg to 20mg. But more recent studies show that the average rate is 23mg. In his opinion, the lowest blood alcohol level of the accused would be 150mg per 100 ml but it could be between 200mg to 260mg per 100 ml. However, Prof Lee admitted that it is a very rough sort of estimate. He agreed that the tables set out in standard works as to the effect of various levels of alcohol can at best only be a guide. Even with the same blood alcohol level, the degree of intoxication of each person will vary and one relevant factor is whether the person is an experienced or an inexperienced drinker.
The defence called Dr R Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist in private practice. In April 1990, Dr Nacarried out a psychiatric assessment of the accused; he interviewed and examined the accused on three separate occasions. His assessment of the mental condition of the accused as set out in the psychiatric report (marked D2) is as follows:
 
 
(i) at the time of the incident, ie stabbing of the deceased, he was suffering from alcoholic intoxication; 
 
(ii) his condition did not amount to unsoundness of mind; he was capable of knowing the nature of his act and what he did was wrong; 
 
(iii) his condition also did not amount to abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury); 
 
(iv) his condition, however, would have affected his ability to form the intention to commit the alleged offence.
  
 
 
In his evidence, Dr Nagulendran testified that at the time of the incident of stabbing he was suffering from amnesia which lasted for a short period; that accounted for his inability to remember what took place just before and during the stabbing. This amnesia is an alcoholic amnesia and lasted for only a short period which usually coincides with peak of the blood alcohol level. However, Dr Nagulendran said that at the time of the stabbing the accused had the basic intent to hurt; that when he was stabbing the deceased, he knew he was stabbing the deceased and was stabbing him at the left side of the neck, and that when he stabbed the deceased the second and third times, he knew he was doing it. On being questioned by the court whether he was in a state of intoxication when he inflicted the three stab wounds, Dr Nagulendran said: 
 
I think so. This is my opinion here. I think the state of intoxication is the one which probably caused his inability to control his actions, the impulsiveness and repeated actions which were done, to hurt the person. In other words, if he didn`t drink that day, then it`s a different type of situation. He was in an intoxicated state, his ability to control his actions was affected. They were impulsively done and there was inability to control his impulsive behaviour. And that is impaired by alcohol.
 
 
 
 
 
 Consideration of the evidence and the defence 
 
 
 
The main contention raised by the defence is that because of the high blood alcohol level in the accused at the time of the offence, he was incapable of forming any intention to inflict those injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of Neelamegam. The two pertinent provisions in this regard are ss 85(2) and 86(2) of the Penal Code. Section 85(2) provides that intoxication is a defence if at the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not know what he did was wrong or did not know what he was doing and he was, by reason of the intoxication, insane, temporarily or otherwise. Section 86(2) provides that `intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the offence`. It has not been suggested by the defence that s 85(2) applies in this case.
As would be apparent from what we said above, there is no objective evidence as to the actual quantity of alcoholic drinks consumed by the accused. We have, however, the evidence of the accused who claims that he drank more than half a bottle of the 3-star Chinese wine at about 8.30pm to 9pm that evening; a glass of 3-star Chinese wine offered to him by the Thai workers at about 10pm; and a big bottle of the ABC stout between 10.30pm to 11.30pm. But we do know that five hours after the stabbing, the blood alcohol level in the accused was established to be 71mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood. Working backwards and depending on the rate of oxidization, the expert witnesses of both the prosecution and the defence have shown that the blood level of the accused at the time of the stabbing could be anything between 150-260mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood.
In any event, from the evidence of the experts, the blood alcohol level itself can never be conclusive to determine the degree of intoxication of the accused. Different people react differently to the same blood alcohol level. It makes a great difference whether the person is or is not an experienced drinker. In our judgment, and here we accept the opinion of Dr Chan (PW15), the more reliable indicator of the state of mind of the accused must be the conduct of the accused immediately prior to and after the offence. In this regard we have the evidence of both Rajendran and Muniandy, as well as the evidence of the ambulance attendant and PC Sim. Their evidence is certainly more reliable than that of the accused and we accept their evidence on this aspect. Rajendran and Muniandy were the friends of both the accused and the deceased and we can see no reason whey they would not but tell the truth.
As we see it, the following circumstances are pertinent. The accused questioned the point-counting done by Neelamegam; he repeatedly asked why Neelamegam shuffled the cards when he went to take food; even after he came back from urinating he repeatedly harped on the question why Neelamegam shuffled the cards; the heated arguments ensued between the accused and Neela; the utterance by the accused that he would `kuttu` the deceased; the accused remembers that after the stabbing he could not hold on to Neelamegam and the latter was sagging to the floor; the accused tried to stop the blood flow from the wounds by pressing against them; he lay by the side of the deceased after realizing that the deceased was seriously or fatally injured; his utterance to Rajendran that his finger prints were on the knife and he was involved; there was no slurring of speech; there was no obvious unsteadiness on the part of the accused, though the ambulance attendant said that when the accused got up from the lying position he was swaying from side-to-side. All these, in our judgment, clearly show a person who was very conscious of his surroundings and who knew what he was saying or doing.
The evidence of the accused was that during that fleeting moment when the three stab wounds were inflicted, he temporarily lost consciousness. He could not remember what happened.
Dr Chan was of the opinion that it was most unlikely that the accused could have amnesia for just ten seconds or thereabouts. He said that by its very nature alcoholic amnesia would extend from some hours into days. On the other hand,Dr Nagulendran expressed the view that the accused was suffering from alcoholic amnesia which lasted for a short period; that the accused was in a state of alcoholic intoxication; that he did not have the `specific intention` to kill but had the `basic intention` to hurt and he had the intention to cause the stab wounds. While the accused in his s 122(6) statement also said he did not know what happened he was able to give a fairly detailed account in his s 122(5) statements: exhs P44, P45 and P46. We find that this so-called amnesia was just a lame excuse on his part to mitigate the wrong he had done. It was an attempt to put up a defence that he was not acting voluntarily. As Dr Nagulendran had said, the accused had the intention to cause the stab wounds. We find that the accused knew what he was doing notwithstanding the fact that at that moment he was under the influence of alcohol. It is irrelevant that the accused did not know that the injuries he inflicted would in the ordinary course of nature cause death; the test is objective.
The next question we have to consider is whether the accused has brought himself within any of the exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code. Counsel for the accused submitted that this is a case where exceptions 1, 2 and 4 apply.
Even on the evidence of the accused himself we find that exception 1 (grave and sudden provocation) cannot apply. The accused and the deceased had been arguing and quarrelling for some time before the fatal stabs took place. The quarrel had obviously become quite violent as the parties used words such as `kuttu`. They were both challenging each other. We do not see how, on the facts, the provocation, if any, could be considered to be `sudden`. Both parties worked themselves up to such a high pitch that a physical confrontation became inevitable.
Turning to exception 2 - exceeding the right of private defence - again we do not think this applies. The two were quarrelling which quarrel gradually became more heated. They were both poised for a physical confrontation which in fact occurred. This is not a case where one party for no rhyme or reason assaults another giving that other a right of private defence.
Then there is exception 4, which provides that culpable homicide is not murder if `it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.` On the evidence before us, it is clear that the fight occurred suddenly as the accused and Neelamegam quarrelled. The quarrel arose suddenly out of an event relating to the shuffling of cards by Neelamegam allegedly before points were counted. There was no question of there being premeditation on the part of any party. To invoke this exception it is immaterial which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.
Muniandy did not see who started the fight. He said he saw the accused take the knife from the rack and he advised the accused to put it back. He did not, however, pay attention whether the accused heeded his advice. He was then eating, quite oblivious to the quarrel that was then raging between the accused and Neelamegam. He only turned his head in the direction of the accused and Neelamegam when Rajendran shouted. At that point, the accused was holding Neelamegam`s head by his left arm and his right hand was holding a knife. Rajendran was trying to wrench the knife from him. Muniandy did not see any stabbing.
Rajendran`s evidence on this aspect was that after the accused said, `I will kuttu you`, and Neelamegam replied, `Can you kuttu me?` or words to that effect, he turned to look at the two of them. He saw the accused move one step backwards and take a knife from the rack. The accused then moved one step forward and caught hold of Neelamegam`s forehead with his left arm and stabbed Neelamegam at the shoulder region close to the neck. When Rajendran was asked if, before the accused took the knife, Neelamegam moved towards the accused, he answered `no` and said that the deceased was standing still. When defence counsel confronted him with his statement to the police, which was tendered at the preliminary inquiry, where he stated: 
 
Both of them moved towards each other as they argued. As the deceased drew closer, I saw Ramasamy retreating back and he then grabbed hold of a knife from the knife rack ...
 
 
 
Rajendran said that he did not see Neelamegam go close to the accused; Neelamegam remained where he was. When pressed further, Rajendran agreed that it was possible that before he turned to look at them, Neelamegam had moved closed to the accused.
As the statement to the police tendered at the preliminary inquiry was given soon after the incident, it stands no reason that what he stated therein is more likely to be accurate than what he now tells the court some two years later.
This leaves us with two points where the evidence of the accused is at variance with that of the prosecution - first, the accused said he was facing the wall when he felt someone grabbing him from behind whereas Rajendran denied that Neelamegam grabbed the accused from behind; second, the accused said he took the knife from a plate on the upper rack whereas Rajendran said the accused took the knife from the knife rack. While these are important points, we do not think they are critical for determining whether exception 4 applies. It seems to us quite clear that immediately prior to the stabbing the quarrel had reached an explosive stage where one party talked about `kuttu` and the other dared the former to do so. Both Muniandy and Rajendran told the court that Neelamegam was much bigger than the accused and in a free fight the accused would lose. In all probability, Neelamegam did rush forward and grabbed the accused who turned round and used the knife as a weapon to `kuttu` the deceased. Both of them were engaged in a fight.
In all the circumstances we find that this is a case where exception 4 applies. We do not think, bearing in mind that Neelamegam was challenging the accused to `kuttu` him and engaging in a fight with the accused, that it could be said that the accused had taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. In the context, we find that the accused used the word `kuttu` to mean `stab`. It could not have meant `poke` or `punch` because it was obvious that the accused was no match for the deceased if he was going to use only his bare hands.
This is an unfortunate incident. The two of them, who were obviously fellow workers, and who shared a cubicle with two others, allowed their passion to have the better of them. To our mind, this was due in no small part to the liquor they had consumed. A tiny misunderstanding was blown out of all proportions. The two had quarrelled before but their previous quarrels had apparently never reached the nasty stage like the present instance where physical violence was resorted to.
Accordingly, we find the accused guilty of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 Order accordingly.",1990-09-26 00:00:00,SG High Court

DAC 63018/03
You, Zakariah bin Zolkifli, M/27 yrs, NRIC No: S7620201Z, DOB: 20 June 1976, are charged that you on 29
th
 day of December 2003, at about 4.15 am at Jalan Bahar Heavy Vehicle Park, Singapore, did commit theft of one cashcard of value $21.70 from a motor vehicle bearing registration number XB 5539K in  possession of one Tan Hong Liang and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Background and statement of facts
2          The accused was to have pleaded guilty before court 24 on 3 December 2003.  At that time, he was only facing one charge (DAC 56895/03).  However, the district judge in court 24 declined to deal with the accused's plea of guilt and decided to adjourn the case to 9 January 2004 for mention before me in court 3, in view of the accused's antecedents.  In the interim, the second offence (DAC 63018/03) was committed on 29 December 2003 while the accused was on bail. 
3          The offences were investigated by officers from two different police divisions and accordingly two separate statements of facts were prepared.  The accused admitted the statements of facts without any qualification.  In respect of the first charge, the accused had befriended the victim, one Saffiah binte Bidin ('Ms Saffiah'), at City Plaza on 9 November 2003 at about 1.00 am.  Shortly thereafter, at about 4.00 am, the accused and Ms Saffiah booked into Ghim Peng Hotel located at No 424 Geylang Road and spent the night in a hotel room. 
4          When Ms Saffiah woke up the next morning at about 9.00 am, she found that the accused had left the room.  She discovered $70 cash and her Sony-Ericsson handphone missing from her bag.  On 18 November 2003, Ms Saffiah spotted the accused at City Plaza at about 2.15 am and called the police.  The accused was placed under arrest.  He subsequently admitted stealing the cash and the handphone from Ms Saffiah.  Only the handphone was recovered from him.  The cash was not recovered.
5          In respect of the second charge, the accused had stolen a cashcard from  a lorry parked at Jalan Bahar Heavy Vehicle Park.  At about 4.00 am on 29 December 2003, the victim, one Tan Hong Liang ('Mr Tan'), heard the sound of breaking glass coming from the direction where he had earlier parked his lorry.  He saw the accused standing near to his lorry with the driver's side window of the lorry already smashed.  On seeing Mr Tan, the accused fled.  The police responded to Mr Tan's call and managed to arrest the accused.
6          According to the accused, while he was walking home, he wanted to buy cigarettes but found that he had insufficient money.  He then decided to break into a vehicle at the Jalan Bahar Heavy Vehicle Park.  He used a metal rod which he found in the vicinity to smash the side window of Mr Tan's lorry in order to steal a cashcard.  The cashcard, with a value of $21.70, was recovered from the accused. 
Antecedents and mitigation
7          The accused's first documented offence dates back to 1989, when he was 12 years old.  He was placed on probation for two years for an offence of fraudulent possession of property (s 37(1) [now s 35(1)] Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184)).  His next brush with the law saw him being sent to a juvenile home for three years for offences of housebreaking and theft by day and by night.  These offences were committed in May 1989, while he was on probation for barely four months.
8          The accused was convicted in November 1992 at the age of 16 for an offence of theft in dwelling (s 380 Penal Code (Cap 224)).  His antecedent report (CRO 60) revealed that from 1992 to 1999, he has been convicted in court for numerous offences, many of which were property-related, on no less than six separate occasions.  In respect of eight such convictions, he was sentenced to pay fines of relatively insubstantial amounts, raging from $500 to $2,000.  The fines were all not paid and he had served the default sentences instead.  He had also been previously admitted once to a drug rehabilitation centre.
9          While he was still undergoing drug supervision in 1999, he was again convicted and sentenced in July 1999.  This was in respect of five offences involving housebreaking and theft, as well as theft simpliciter (with another four similar or related charges taken into consideration).  He was sentenced to an aggregate term of four and a half years' imprisonment.
10        In mitigation, the accused said that he was sorry for what he had done and pleaded for leniency.
Reasons for sentence
i.          Pre-sentence report for Corrective Training
11        Despite his recent sentence of four and a half years' imprisonment, the accused was apparently not deterred from further crime.  The fact that he had committed a further offence while on bail for a pending criminal charge confirmed his propensity to reoffend.
12        My main aim was to ensure that he was incapacitated for a sufficiently lengthy period, to prevent further crime and hopefully to serve as more of a deterrent than his previous sentence did.  As he was still relatively young, I was of the view that he should be afforded one final opportunity to acquire some useful skills while serving out his sentence.  For these reasons, my first thought was to consider his suitability for corrective training.
13        The corrective training report ('CT report') was submitted for my consideration on 6 February 2004.  It came to my attention that after the prisons counsellor had interviewed the accused for the purpose of preparing the CT report, the accused had applied to the Law Society's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme ('CLAS') on 26 January 2004 for legal aid.  In CLAS' letter dated 5 February 2004 addressed to the accused, and copied to court 3, the accused was informed that CLAS does not cover plead guilty cases.  In any event, the court had already called for a CT report.  His application for legal aid was therefore rejected.  
14        Before sentencing the accused, I ensured that the accused was aware of the outcome of his application to CLAS.  He informed me that nonetheless he wished to engage counsel.  I reminded him that he had already pleaded guilty,   been convicted and afforded an opportunity to mitigate.  With the CT report in place, all that remained was for me to decide on sentence.  As such, I was not minded to allow any adjournment for him to engage counsel.
15        I permitted the accused a further opportunity to mitigate before I passed sentence.  He asked to be given one last chance.  He said that his mother was alone as his stepfather was not helping her.
16        According to the CT report, the accused was certified to be physically and mentally fit to undergo corrective training.  More importantly, he was assessed to fall within the 'high risk' category of offenders, with a 58 to 74% chance of reoffending within one year of his release (page 4 of the CT report).  A number of observations noted by the prisons counsellor in the CT report were also pertinent. 
17        The CT report revealed that the accused did not complete his primary school education.  He ran away from the juvenile home when he was 14.  At Part Five (page 2), he was observed during the interview with the counsellor to have been 'quiet and guarded', and also 'evasive and easily distracted'.  He tried to minimise his culpability or justify his criminal conduct.  For instance, he would claim that he did not know what he had done because he was drunk.
18        The CT report also gave a glimpse of the accused's family background.  According to the accused, his parents were divorced and his mother had remarried.  He has been living with his mother and stepfather since then.  His mother was not educated.  His two sisters were both married and were living apart from them.  His stepfather was unemployed and although the accused claimed to get along well with him, he also said that they seldom talked. 
19        To make ends meet, the accused's family would sell flowers at Muslim cemeteries and take on other odd jobs from time to time.  The accused said that he worked odd jobs to support himself whenever he was out of prison. However, he had remained jobless over the past one year despite trying his very best to look for a job.
20        In evaluating the accused's 'specific risks of offending' (Part Seven, page 4), the counsellor opined that the accused 'tended to minimise or rationalise his offending behaviour'.  He had 'little empathy for others' and 'showed little remorse for his wrongdoings'.  He lacked pro-social support and had only a superficial relationship with his family members.  In what appeared to be an afterthought, the accused had also claimed that he was usually drunk whenever he tried to steal.  He claimed that he would never have done what he did if he had been clear-headed.
21        In conclusion (Part Eight, page 5), the accused was assessed to have a 'strong anti-social personality' and 'weak protective factors'.  This placed him at high risk of re-offending.
22        In the light of the above evaluation, I was not confident that the accused's propensity towards crime would be easily curbed.  To make matters worse, he was unremorseful about his conduct.  This was evident from his suggestion that he would not have stolen if he had not been drunk.
ii.         Intoxication not a defence or mitigating factor
23        As I have noted in some recent cases (eg. 
Andasamy Alagurasamy v PP
 
[2003] SGDC 280
; 
Lim Beng Yee v PP
 
[2003] SGDC 309
; 
Dorai Antoine v PP
 
[2004] SGDC 7
), attempts are often made to qualify or retract guilty pleas during pre-sentence interviews only when accused persons come to realise that they may be facing extended terms of incarceration as repeat offenders.  In my view, the accused was not attempting to qualify or retract his plea.  He was however plainly trying to diminish his culpability by attributing his conduct to the influence of alcohol.
24        I concurred with the counsellor's opinion that the accused had merely raised the issue of intoxication as an afterthought.  Prior to the interview with the counsellor, he had made no mention at any point of being influenced by drink.  In each instance, his conduct also suggested that his offences were deliberate.  In respect of the first offence, he had the presence of mind to slip away quickly from the hotel room after taking Ms Saffiah's valuables, while she was still asleep.  In respect of the second offence, he had gone around purposefully looking for a vehicle to break into because he wanted money to buy cigarettes.  He could only have committed both offences with full consciousness and knowledge of his objectives.     
25        Section 85 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) clearly did not apply to afford the accused any defence of intoxication.  There was also no mitigating force whatsoever in his claims.  Even if he had really been intoxicated, this must have been self-induced.  As noted in 
Mani Nedumaran v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 411
 and 
Balasubramaniam Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 314
, self-induced intoxication is not a valid mitigating factor in such circumstances.
Conclusion
26        The accused was at 'high risk' of reoffending; he was likely to reoffend upon release from custody, just as he had reoffended while on bail.  I did not discern any genuine remorse.  He had minimal protective factors.  He had little family support and no capacity or inclination to find gainful means of employment.  He could not be considered for preventive detention as he was below the qualifying age of 30.
27        At 27 years of age, there was at least still a prospect, albeit a slender one, that he might eventually be reformed.  The critical consideration is the length of time the court feels is necessary for real reform to be achieved: see 
G Ravichander v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 587
.  I was of the view that a term of corrective training in excess of the minimum period of five years would be appropriate.  I therefore sentenced him to seven years' corrective training.  This was also necessary to prevent further crime by incapacitating him for a suitable duration.",2004-02-17 00:00:00,SG District Court

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant (“Phua”) was convicted in the district court by District Judge Teo Weng Kuan of two charges of rioting punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). He was sentenced to a total of 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Phua appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed both appeals and now set out my grounds.
Background
2          Phua claimed trial to the following two charges:

You, Phua Song Hua, are charged that that you on the 18
th
 day of April 2002 at or about 2.56 am, along Mohammad Sultan Road off River Valley Road, Singapore, together with Bai Jinda Roy’ston, Leong Heen Meng, Oh Shifa and 2 unknown male persons, were members of an unlawful assembly, whose common object was to cause hurt to the said Lim Eu Zhi and Goi Wee Shien and in the prosecution of such common object of the said assembly, did cause hurt to the said Lim Eu Zhi and Goi Wee Shien, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
3          The four other persons named in the charges – Oh Shifa (“Oh”), Bai Jinda (“Bai”), Tan Choon Say (“Tan”) and Leong Heen Meng (“Leong”) – had pleaded guilty to reduced charges of unlawful assembly under s 143 of the Penal Code. They were called as defence witnesses at Phua’s trial.
The Prosecution’s case
4          The two victims, Lim Eu Zhi (“Lim”) and Goi Wee Shien (“Goi”), had gone to a pub named Club 7 (“the club”). While they were leaving the pub, Lim was confronted by a group of five to six persons led by Oh. Oh and Lim had a brief scuffle, but the club’s bouncers swiftly intervened and the altercation ceased.
The first incident
5          When Lim and Goi were walking later towards their motorcycles, they were again confronted by Oh who was leading a group of more than five men. The group punched and kicked Lim for about a minute. When a policeman (Staff Sergeant Mohamad Hirwan bin Muhd, hereinafter referred to as “Hirwan”) arrived, all the assailants except Oh and Leong dispersed. While Hirwan was recording the particulars of Oh and Leong, Oh spoke to Lim and both managed to resolve the matter amicably. Hirwan then allowed all of them to leave.
6          During the trial, Lim could identify Oh, Leong and Bai as part of the group, but he could not remember if Phua was involved in the altercation. Goi, in contrast, identified Phua (in addition to Oh and Leong) as one of the persons who had surrounded Lim while four or five others attacked him.
The second incident
7          Lim and Goi then went to a convenience store, Seven Eleven, to purchase some cigarettes. After leaving the store, they were confronted by a different group of three men, who asked them which gang they belonged to. At this juncture, Bai, who was with the earlier group, shouted to the three men in Hokkien, “It was them!” The two groups then merged to surround Lim and Goi, and attacked them with punches and kicks.
8          Lim testified to being attacked by five or six persons. At one point, while he was on the ground, Phua punched him on the left side of his head. Lim specifically remembered Phua as being “quite small-sized” and clothed with a “long-sleeved white-coloured shirt”. Goi also confirmed that Phua was one of the persons in this group that attacked them.
9          The police arrived then, and the assailants fled towards some taxis. Sergeant Sharul bin Osman (“Sharul”) saw four persons running and boarding a taxi, but Sharul managed to stop the taxi and detain them. Hirwan brought Lim and Goi to identify the assailants. They confirmed that all four persons – Bai, Tan, Leong and Phua – were part of the group of assailants. Lim and Goi were then sent for medical examinations, and were found to have suffered injuries in the form of bruises to their heads and arms.
The Defence
10        Phua claimed that he was in the vicinity of the club at the material time, but was not involved in both incidents. He did not adduce any evidence to prove an alibi pursuant to s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). Instead, he called Bai, Leong, Tan and Oh to testify that he was not with them during the two incidents.
11        According to Phua, he had gone to the club with Bai, where he met Tan and Leong. He left the club later to purchase a drink at Seven Eleven. While consuming his drink outside the store, he contacted Bai and Tan, and arranged to meet them at the store to take a taxi together. While Phua was waiting for them, he witnessed a commotion opposite the club, which was dispersed by the police. This was the first incident which Phua denied being involved in.
12        After Phua purchased another drink, he witnessed another commotion, which was the second incident. He decided to leave in a taxi first and contact his friends later. When he entered the taxi, Bai, Tan and Leong suddenly appeared and rushed into the same taxi. However, the police arrived and stopped the vehicle.
The decision below
13        The trial judge convicted Phua of the two offences for the following reasons:
(a)        He did not accept Phua’s evidence. In his opinion, Phua’s story was added to, changed and finally abandoned for a new version altogether. Furthermore, certain aspects of his testimony were improbable and contradictory.
(b)        The testimonies of the four defence witnesses contradicted Phua’s evidence and had irreconcilable discrepancies. In particular, the credibility of Leong and Bai was impeached when they were confronted with their previous inconsistent statements to the police.
(c)        In contrast, Lim and Goi had provided consistent and coherent accounts, which were free from fundamentally irreconcilable discrepancies. The Prosecution’s case was further bolstered by the testimonies of the arresting officers, which the trial judge found to be consistent.
14        The trial judge sentenced Phua to 12 months’ imprisonment on the first charge, and 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane on the second charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
The appeal
15        Essentially, Phua disputed the trial judge’s findings of fact and asserted that his version of the material events should have been accepted. Phua’s exact grounds of appeal were not succinctly stated, but his main contentions could be summarised as follows:
(a)        the identification evidence which the Prosecution relied on was flawed;
(b)        the trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the testimony of the defence witnesses;
(c)        the elements of the offence in s 146 were not fulfilled and the charges should have been amended; and
(d)        the sentences were manifestly excessive in view of the minor role played by Phua.
Whether the identification evidence which the Prosecution relied on was flawed
The first charge
16        Phua contended that the identification evidence concerning the first charge was weak, since only Goi had noticed Phua at the scene and the fight had lasted only 30 seconds. In my opinion, the trial judge was entitled to rely solely on Goi’s identification evidence to conclude that Phua was present. I had noted in 
Low Lin Lin v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 14
 at [49] that “a conviction may be warranted on the testimony of one witness alone, 
so long as the court is aware of the dangers and subjects the evidence to careful scrutiny
” [emphasis added]. In 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
, I also held that it was the quality of identification evidence, and not the number of witnesses that counted. I did not accept that an accused could never be convicted on identification evidence alone when there was only one witness to the offence.
17        In the present case, I was satisfied that the trial judge had taken great pains to analyse Goi’s evidence before deciding to accept Goi’s testimony. He came to the reasonable conclusion that Goi was able to remember Phua since he was an onlooker and would have noticed more details than Lim, who was the one being attacked. Furthermore, the trial judge noted that Goi could describe Phua with great detail as a “small built, frail” man with a “long sleeve white T-shirt”. Goi could also give a satisfactory explanation as to why he could distinctly recall seeing Phua; he saw Phua again in the second incident and therefore Phua’s image was firmly etched in his memory. In the light of the deliberate caution exercised by the trial judge, Phua’s contention was untenable.
18        I also drew counsel for Phua’s attention to the pertinent decision by the Court of Appeal in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
, which I recently applied in 
Govindaraj Perumalsamy v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 16
. The guidelines in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 for the assessment of identification evidence were endorsed and reformulated as a three-step test:
(a)        The first question which a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case where there is identification evidence is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the Defence to be mistaken.
(b)        If so, the second question should be this: Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which identification by the witness was made? Some non-exhaustive factors to consider include the length of time for which the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused and the length of time which elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police.
(c)        If the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should then seek other evidence which supports the correctness of the identification.
19        On the present facts, Phua’s conviction hinged principally on the accuracy of Goi’s evidence, as there was no other witness who could corroborate him. Proceeding to the next guideline, I found that Goi’s evidence was of considerably high quality. Although he observed the fight for merely 30 seconds, he was not far away from the group. I inferred, from the record of proceedings, that he was at close quarters with Phua as he had actually attempted to stop the scuffle. He also saw Phua twice, and had identified Phua to the police very shortly after the second incident. I therefore concluded that the identification evidence of Phua for the first charge was reliable, notwithstanding identification by only one victim. There was then no necessity for me to consider the third guideline.
The second charge
20        Counsel for Phua alleged that the “identification parade”, in which Phua, Bai, Leong and Tan were shown to the victims, was improperly conducted. He argued that the trial judge’s refusal to allow cross-examination of Hirwan on the identification parade procedure was prejudicial to Phua.
21        I did not accept this submission as there was no indication of impropriety in the identification procedure. Admittedly, this identification parade was not conducted according to the usual formalities. In fact, counsel for Phua, in his cross-examination of Hirwan, termed the whole procedure an “immediate identification parade”. Nonetheless, the entire procedure appeared to me to be no more than a confirmation by the victims of their earlier identification of Phua, rather than a formal identification parade which had to comply with strict rules. Since the judge did not allow cross-examination on the exact procedure used for an “immediate identification parade”, it was not possible, in the absence of any express guidelines in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), to criticise it as being improper.
22        In any event, I did not find the lack of cross-examination on the above procedure to be prejudicial to Phua. Even if the procedure was irregular, the identification evidence of Lim and Goi need not be automatically excluded. In 
PP v Ong Phee Hoon James
 
[2000] 3 SLR 293
, I found that the casual “face-to-face” manner of identification was procedurally improper. Yet, this finding merely affected the weight and not the admissibility of the identification evidence. The identification evidence was still evaluated according to the 
Turnbull
 guidelines, and found to be reliable. Only if there is evidence of bad faith or deliberate flouting of procedural requirements will an identification parade not be upheld: 
Ong Phee Hoon
 and 
Thirumalai Kumar v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 434
.
23        I was thus aware that the possibility of irregularity in the final identification of Phua need not preclude the court’s acceptance of the earlier identification evidence. In this regard, I found the identification evidence in the second fight more compelling than in the first. Both victims had testified to seeing Phua and specified that Phua had attacked Lim. In particular, Lim recalled being punched on the left side of his head by Phua. He then noticed that Phua was “quite small-sized” and was wearing a long-sleeved white shirt. Lim and Goi, who had seen Phua at close quarters (Goi had seen him twice), and described him in similar terms, were able to identify him again before the police without hesitation. Once again, the 
Turnbull
 guidelines were amply fulfilled. Phua had no basis to find fault with the trial judge’s decision concerning the accuracy of identification evidence in both charges.
Whether the trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the testimony of the defence witnesses
24        I found this ground of appeal completely unmeritorious. It is settled law that an appellate court will generally defer to the trial judge’s findings of fact when the findings hinge on his assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 and 
PP v Fazely bin Rahmat
 
[2003] 2 SLR 184
. Therefore, Phua had to convince me that the trial judge’s decision was plainly wrong or wholly against the weight of evidence: 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 and 
Mustaza bin Abdul Majid v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 18
. From the record of proceedings, I observed that the trial judge had meticulously analysed each defence witness’s testimony, leaving no stone unturned, and had concluded that these witnesses had manifested material discrepancies which undermined their credibility. Before me, Phua could not successfully refute these findings of fact. I therefore agreed with the trial judge that the defence’s position – that Phua was not at the scene during both fights – was unsustainable. I turn now to highlight some of these discrepancies.
25        First, Phua’s own testimony was far from watertight. He appeared to be deliberately distancing himself from both incidents, by giving only very brief accounts of the fights during his examination-in-chief. Though he attributed the paucity of details to his poor vision, he was ironically able to add significant details during his cross-examination, including how helmets were used in the second incident and the number of persons assisting Oh in the first incident. After being confronted with many inconsistencies between his police statement and his oral testimony (which amounted to 11 points of inconsistency as tabulated by the trial judge), he conceded that everything in his statement was the truth, thus effectively renouncing all that he said in court as “mistakes”. The trial judge was certainly justified in concluding that these discrepancies could not simply be attributed to defective memory, as some differences were significant. As an illustration, Phua claimed in his police statement that he had never seen Leong before, but testified during the trial that he had met Leong at the club. In another inconsistency, Phua in his statement gave a detailed description of how he saw a big group led by Oh approaching Lim and Goi, but, according to his oral evidence, he saw both groups together when he emerged from the Seven Eleven store. Since Phua’s testimony was highly malleable, it was dangerous to accept his defence that he was not present on both occasions.
26        Second, one of the defence witnesses, Leong, supported Phua by confirming that Phua was not present in both incidents. Yet, when cross-examined on his previous statement, he admitted that it was a completely different version from his oral testimony. Moreover, his version of how he fled to the taxi was completely at odds with all the other defence witnesses’ accounts. The others testified that Leong, Bai and Tan fled to the taxi after the fight and saw Phua inside. Only Leong recounted how he and Bai were initially in the taxi with Phua before they saw the second commotion. He alleged that he and Bai then joined in the fight, pulled Tan away and returned to the taxi.      
27        Third, Bai’s credibility was similarly shaken when he was shown a material discrepancy in his police statement. He had earlier stated that as he was fleeing from the second fight, he had boarded the taxi with Phua and the others. This was patently contradictory to his claim at the trial that Phua was already in the taxi. Since Bai was dumbfounded and at a loss for an explanation, his testimony that Phua was already seated in the taxi was effectively unreliable. This discrepancy was particularly damaging to Phua’s case, as Bai was an essential witness who had gone to the club with Phua, and who testified that on both occasions Phua was absent.
28        Finally, there was Tan’s testimony. Tan only testified to Phua’s absence in the second incident. Yet, all that he testified to was rendered inconsequential when he could not withstand cross-examination and finally conceded that he could not be sure that Phua was not involved in the fight. To my mind, the defence proffered by Phua was feeble and I was fully convinced that the Defence had failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.
The previous charges that Oh, Leong, Bai and Tan pleaded guilty to
29        The above inconsistencies would have sufficed to dismiss this ground of appeal, but I noted that the trial judge had also relied on the contradictions between the oral testimonies and the earlier pleas of guilt of Oh, Leong, Bai and Tan. These witnesses had pleaded guilty to charges stating that Phua was present and that there were more than five persons involved in the fights. Specifically, Bai, Leong and Oh’s charges included Phua’s name for the first fight, while Leong and Tan’s charges implicated Phua for the second fight. However, during the trial, they blatantly denied that Phua was part of the group, and asserted that there were fewer than five persons in each incident. The Prosecution was entitled to cross-examine them on these discrepancies. As I had decided in 
PP v Liew Kim Choo
 
[1997] 3 SLR 699
 and 
PP v Heah Lian Khin
 
[2000] 3 SLR 609
, the statement of facts which a witness had previously admitted to in a guilty plea can be properly classified as a confession for the purposes of s 17 of the Evidence Act, and a witness can be cross-examined on it under s 147 of the Evidence Act. This principle should be equally applicable to the cross-examination on a charge admitted to in a guilty plea. I found then that the credibility of the witnesses was undermined in instances when they could not adequately explain the glaring contradictions. Notably, Bai, when confronted with the charge he had previously pleaded guilty to, changed his evidence and admitted that there were seven to eight persons involved.
30        However, I was not inclined to place too much emphasis on the discrepancy concerning the insertion of Phua’s name in the charges. In 
Liew Kim Choo
, I enumerated various factors that militated against treating a statement of facts as evidence which could, on its own, convict an accomplice. I recognised that there were many reasons why a person might plead guilty and admit to a statement of facts even though the statement of facts might be untruthful. I noted that false guilty pleas were very plausible, since the statement of facts was not prepared by the accused, but by the investigating officer or the Public Prosecutor. The judge, in accepting a statement of facts, only needed to ensure that the accused had admitted to all the particulars material to the offence. I took these factors into consideration in 
Ang Ser Kuang v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 909
 and held that when immaterial particulars of a statement of facts were relied upon to reduce the credibility of a witness, the evidential value of the statement of facts had to be diminished.
31        In the present case, the defence witnesses had explained that they had objected to the inclusion of Phua’s name in the charge, but nevertheless proceeded to plead guilty when his name was not removed. The insertion of Phua’s name was not material to their conviction and any inaccuracy would not have vitiated their plea of guilt. Their subsequent denial of Phua’s involvement in the trial did not, 
per se
, show that they were concocting their evidence at the trial. Rather, I found their credibility to be largely undermined by other discrepancies listed above. The same could not be said for the witnesses’ assertion that there were fewer than five persons. This fact was material to the charge, as five or more persons are required to fulfil the definition of an unlawful assembly under s 142 of the Penal Code. The reversal of their positions in the trial was thus detrimental to their credibility. Further, the judge noted that Phua in his police statement acknowledged that there were more than five persons in both incidents. It was unusual that, though Phua was not contesting the number of persons involved, the other witnesses decided to contradict their previous admissions and testify to the contrary. This particular inconsistency was surely indicative of the witnesses’ excessive tailoring of their evidence in a bid to aid Phua. As such, I still agreed with the trial judge’s conclusion that the defence witnesses were not credible.
Whether the two charges should have been reduced to s 143 offences
32        I also found this contention to be devoid of merit. It was clear to me that the main ingredients of the offence of rioting, as defined in s 146 of the Penal Code, had been fulfilled for both charges. The relevant provision is:
Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.
33        The first requirement is the presence of an unlawful assembly, which is, in turn, defined in s 141. Essentially, there must be an assembly of five or more persons, having a common object which corresponds with one of the objects specified in paras (a) to (e) of s 141. The evidence here showed that there were more than five persons in both incidents and that there was a common object of causing hurt, which satisfied object (c), “to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, 
or other offence
” [emphasis added].
34        Next, violence must have been employed by the unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object. There is again no dispute here that in both instances, the group punched and kicked Lim and Goi. Although Hirwan did not witness the fighting in the first incident, Bai, Leong and Oh testified that they had attacked Lim.
35        Lastly, Phua must have been a “member” of the unlawful assembly. Section 142 stipulates that a member is one who, “being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it”. I elaborated in 
Lim Thian Hor v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
 that the person should be aware of and concur with the common object. In this regard, participation in the common object of the unlawful assembly need not be manifested by overt acts. I held in that case that mere presence, together with direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared the common object, can amount to membership in the unlawful assembly. This principle was applied again in 
Osman bin Ramli v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 1
, where I inferred that the appellant, having seen the fight and chosen to remain without any special reason, was part of the unlawful assembly.
36        Similarly in this case, though there was no evidence of Phua having punched Lim in the first fight, Phua chose to stay with the group while Lim was being attacked and offered no special reason for doing so. The trial judge had drawn the proper inference that Phua had concurred with the common object of causing hurt to Lim. In the second scuffle, it was even clearer, from Phua’s own participation in the fight, that he was in full agreement with the object of the assembly. On all counts, the offences of rioting were adequately made out.
37        The fact that the other witnesses had been charged with s 143 was no reason for Phua to be similarly charged under that section. It is common knowledge that accused persons who plead guilty, can be charged with less serious offences. In 
PP v Knight Glenn Jeyasingam
 
[1999] 2 SLR 499
, I alluded to the practice of plea negotiation, in which representations are made to the Attorney-General’s Chambers. I acknowledged that this process might result in a 
quid pro quo
 such as a reduction of the charge. Since Phua chose to proceed with the trial, amendment of his charges could only occur if the elements of the offence were not satisfied. Phua failed to show how the ingredients in s 146 were not proven. Accordingly, this ground of appeal should fail.
Whether the sentences on both charges were manifestly excessive
38        Phua’s counsel scathingly criticised the sentences as being harsher than those meted out to Oh, Bai, Leong and Tan, who had played a more major role. This objection neglected the fact that these witnesses had pleaded guilty to a less serious offence of unlawful assembly (s 143), which has a lower sentencing regime of a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment. The principle of parity of sentence is irrelevant once there are different offences, as there is no longer any common basis for comparison. Moreover, as evident from 
Knight Glenn
, plea negotiations will invariably result in reduced charges or sentences. Harsh as it might seem, the accused person who chooses to proceed with the trial runs the inherent risk that he might suffer a much heavier sentence than his accomplices who plead guilty. Phua, having failed to prove that he was not involved in both incidents of rioting, could not now rely on the fact that a heavier sentence 
vis-à-vis
 his accomplices had been meted out.
39        Under s 147, Phua faced imprisonment for a term of up to five years, and was also liable to be caned. Rioting has been consistently viewed as a serious offence, one which breaches public tranquillity and which warrants a deterrent sentence. The gravamen of the offence of rioting is the pursuit of a common unlawful purpose through weight of numbers. The individual is thus not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting: 
R v Caird
 (1970) 54 Cr App R 499.
40        This principle does not inexorably imply that the role of the accused, relative to other offenders, can never be taken into account. In 
Lim Thian Hor
, the accused did not attack the victim himself, but his son had used violence. The former was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, but his son received a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Likewise, in the first incident, Phua had not participated in the punching of Lim. Twelve months’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence, considering the young age of Phua (18 years at sentencing and 17 years at the time of offence) and the good testimonials on his performance in National Service.
41        Counsel for Phua urged me to set aside the sentence of caning for the second offence, but I rejected this submission. I acknowledged the fact that Phua was young. Nevertheless, the court, when dealing with youthful offenders, has to strike a balance between public interest and the interest of the offender: 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
. The seriousness of the offence of rioting was a strong factor which dissuaded me from reducing Phua’s sentence. My view was further fortified by the presence of several aggravating factors. Phua did not have a clean record, having committed an offence of affray barely four months before this present offence. I noted that that offence was similar in nature to rioting as it involved the use of violence. In addition, Phua and the rest of the unlawful assembly had deliberately sought out Lim and Goi, in flagrant disregard of the police’s earlier intervention in the first fight. In the trial judge’s words, they “were deliberately spoiling for a fight, and they did so in clear disregard of the law”. Such defiance could not be viewed lightly.
42        The sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was reasonable, being at the lower range of the sentences meted out for “non-secret society related” offences. The courts have consistently imposed 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment, as well as caning ranging from three to 12 strokes: 
Chua Hwee Kiat Louis v PP

Yim Kar Mun Stanley v PP

), 
Rajasekaran s/o Armuthelingam v PP
 
[2001] SGHC 275
 and 
Tan Hui Li v PP
 
[1999] SGDC 1
. I only noticed two cases – 
Ang Kian Choon Lawrence v PP
 
[1997] SGDC 2
 and 
Mohamed Saleem s/o Mohamed Kassim v PP
 
[1998] SGDC 1
 – in which the accused persons were not caned, but the facts therein were distinguishable. Significantly, the young offenders in those cases had clean records. In 
Ang Kian Choon Lawrence
, the accused had also pleaded guilty. None of these factors were present here. Accordingly, I dismissed this ground of appeal and upheld the sentences imposed by the trial judge.
Conclusion
43        Phua had failed to show how the judge erred in convicting him based on reliable identification evidence and in finding his defence devoid of credibility. While Phua’s participation in the first offence might have been minimal, his active involvement in punching Lim in the second offence was serious and could not warrant a lenient sentence. For the aforementioned reasons, Phua’s appeals against conviction and sentence were without merit and were accordingly dismissed.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 This was a petition for a criminal revision of the decision of District Judge Teoh Ai Lin. The petitioner was convicted on one charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and served his sentence. He then petitioned to quash his earlier conviction.
The facts
2
         
 The petitioner was a freelance housing agent. In 1992, he met R Pillaisay Jaganathan (“Mr Jaganathan”) and Nagosri Uthirapathy Pillai (“Mrs Jaganathan”), a married couple, and offered to help them in a mortgage refinancing transaction. The application for the refinancing transaction was submitted to the Rochor Road branch of Overseas Union Trust (“OUT”) on 12 November 1992 and was completed on 17 November 1992. Prior to the completion of the transaction, the petitioner had a telephone conversation with Mrs Jaganathan in which he mentioned to her that he expected payment for his assistance. It was undisputed that Mrs Jaganathan had agreed to such a payment, although the sum to be paid was not confirmed.

 Sometime after 17 November 1992, the petitioner telephoned Mrs Jaganathan regarding his commission payment. He asked for a sum of $21,000 and mentioned that this sum was to be shared with one Lim Geok Lan (“Mdm Lim”), a bank manager at OUT. After some bargaining between the petitioner and Mrs Jaganathan, a sum of $14,000 was agreed upon. Mrs Jaganathan later testified that she only agreed to pay the $14,000 because Mdm Lim’s name was mentioned. Mrs Jaganathan added that she had not informed her husband about the matter, as he would not have agreed to pay such a large sum.
4
         
 Mrs Jaganathan then met the petitioner at the road near her house and passed him a cheque signed by her husband, dated 20 January 1993, in the sum of $14,000. She testified that her husband usually signed his cheques in blank. The handwriting on the cheque was that of Mrs Jaganathan’s daughter (“Geetha”). Geetha testified that she usually filled out the cheques for her parents because her handwriting was neat. She added that Mr Jaganathan would usually pass the cheques that he had signed to Mrs Jaganathan, who would in turn ask Geetha to fill them in for her.
5
         
 Subsequently, the petitioner fell out with Mr and Mrs Jaganathan. Since then, the parties have not been on good terms. About one or two years later, Mrs Jaganathan met Mdm Lim to enquire about redeeming the current mortgage refinancing loan and obtaining a new one. In the course of their conversation, the petitioner’s name was mentioned. Mrs Jaganathan informed Mdm Lim that the petitioner had said that Mdm Lim had a share in the $14,000 payment that was made to him. Mdm Lim denied this. Mdm Lim testified that she was upset about what Mrs Jaganathan had told her and raised the matter with the petitioner. The petitioner denied that he had so informed Mrs Jaganathan and claimed that it was all a misunderstanding. A few days later, the petitioner called Mdm Lim and apologised for having used her name, promising not to do it again.
6
         
 The petitioner denied that some of these incidents had occurred. He claimed that Mrs Jaganathan had agreed to pay a 4% commission to him in the presence of her husband. He also claimed that Mr Jaganathan had signed a commission agreement to this effect and that he had never told Mrs Jaganathan that the commission was to be shared with Mdm Lim. The petitioner testified that Mr Jaganathan signed the cheque for $14,000 at the petitioner’s house. The petitioner’s wife also testified that Mr and Mrs Jaganathan had come to the petitioner’s house on two occasions. On the second occasion, the petitioner’s wife claimed that she had seen Mr Jaganathan signing a cheque and handing it to her husband. The petitioner also denied promising Mdm Lim that he would not use her name again. He added that he had only apologised to Mdm Lim to save his friendship with her.
The decision below
7
         
 The district judge observed that the Prosecution’s case rested on Mrs Jaganathan’s evidence. She found that despite some immaterial inconsistencies in Mrs Jaganathan’s testimony and the danger of malice in her evidence as a result of the falling out between the parties, Mrs Jaganathan was largely an honest, consistent and non-malicious witness. The district judge analysed Mr Jaganathan’s evidence with caution, taking into account the fact that the parties had fallen out and that, consequently, there was a danger of Mr Jaganathan tailoring his evidence to corroborate his wife’s. Nevertheless, the district judge found that Mr Jaganathan 
was
 a truthful witness. She noted that Mr Jaganathan did not corroborate his wife’s testimony regarding the commission sharing (an important issue around which the charge against the petitioner revolved). The district judge held that if Mr Jaganathan had been malicious, he would have embellished his evidence to support his wife’s claims on the commission sharing.
8
         
 On the other hand, the district judge took issue with the petitioner’s testimony and highlighted the various discrepancies and improbabilities therein. She noted that in light of Geetha’s evidence, it was highly improbable that Mr Jaganathan would have signed the $14,000 cheque in the petitioner’s presence. In this respect, the district judge also found that the petitioner’s wife had tailored her evidence to corroborate the petitioner’s. Additionally, the district judge found that the petitioner’s account of his dealings with the Jaganathans and of how the commission agreement came about was unconvincing. She found that this cast doubt on the petitioner’s veracity.
9
         
 The district judge also had to consider a variety of other issues, including the inconsistencies in the petitioner’s evidence as opposed to Mdm Lim’s, the petitioner’s conduct when he was charged, the admissibility of his February 2001 statement to a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) officer and the inconsistencies between this statement and the petitioner’s testimony in court. After she had considered the various issues before her, the district judge found that the elements that must be proved in a charge under s 420 PC had been fulfilled. Consequently, she convicted the petitioner on the charge and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 12 months.
10
       
 The petitioner then filed, but later withdrew, a notice of appeal against the conviction. He completed the 12-month term of imprisonment.
The petition for criminal revision
11
       
 The petitioner made several submissions in support of his petition. Almost all of these submissions revolved around the fact that the petitioner had now managed to find the commission agreement that he had mentioned at trial. He contended that the substantial basis of his conviction was his inability to produce the original or a copy of the commission agreement signed by Mr Jaganathan and highlighted the instances in the district judge’s grounds of decision where the commission agreement was mentioned. He contended, in general, that the discovery of the commission agreement undermined the basis of his conviction. As such, he argued that his petition for criminal revision should be allowed due to the serious injustice that had been caused to him.
12
       
 As the petitioner’s submissions revolved largely around the point relating to the discovery of the commission agreement, I dealt with his submissions in the following manner:
(a)
       
 whether the commission agreement was admissible as fresh evidence; and
(b)
       
 in the event that the commission agreement was admissible as evidence, whether the petition for criminal revision should be allowed.
Admissibility of the commission agreement as fresh evidence
13
       
 My immediate observation with regard to this petition was the fact that the petitioner had not applied by way of a criminal motion to adduce the commission agreement as evidence. Instead, he had submitted the commission agreement together with his petition for criminal revision and a supporting affidavit. The appropriate procedure in so far as the adduction of fresh evidence is concerned would be by way of a criminal motion. Indeed, this was the procedure adopted in 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
, 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 687
, 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
 and 
Tan Sai Tiang v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 439
, all cases in which an adduction of fresh evidence was sought.
14
       
 In any case, despite this procedural irregularity, I retained the power to admit fresh evidence where such evidence was necessary. In this respect, s 257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) would be the relevant provision with regard to admitting fresh evidence at this stage. Section 257(1) CPC reads as follows:
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate’s Court.
15
       
 Although s 257(1) CPC refers to the adduction of fresh evidence at an appellate stage, the section is equally applicable in the context of a criminal revision by virtue of s 268(1) CPC:
The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
16
       
 However, I hasten to add that this power remains a discretionary one. Inefficient petitioners or litigants who blatantly fail to comply with the appropriate procedure to adduce fresh evidence, that is 
via
 a criminal motion, should not be allowed to abuse s 257(1) CPC as a “backdoor” means of adducing fresh evidence.
17
       
 In exercising this power, then, our courts have applied the three conditions of non-availability, relevance and reliability, as enshrined in 
Ladd v Marshall
 [1954] 3 All ER 745. Interestingly, the petitioner failed to make any submissions regarding these three conditions. Nevertheless, I proceeded to examine the three conditions in order to determine if all of them were fulfilled in this petition before deciding whether the commission agreement should be admitted in evidence. In this respect, the relevant portion of the holding in 
Ladd v Marshall
 (
per
 Denning LJ at 748) bears repetition:
In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial: second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive: third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
This aspect of the judgment in 
Ladd v Marshall
 was adopted in 
Juma’at bin Samad
, with the added caution that the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited. Most recently, these conditions were affirmed in 
Tan Puay Boon v PP
 
[2003] 3 SLR 390
. With these in mind, I turned to apply the three conditions to the facts of this petition in order to determine if the commission agreement should be adduced in evidence.
Non-availability
18
       
 Under this first condition, the petitioner had to show that the fresh evidence that he sought to adduce could not have been available with reasonable diligence for use at trial.
19
       
 In his affidavit, the petitioner stated that he was unable to find the commission agreement during the trial because he had moved residences four times. However, it was apparent from the notes of evidence that the petitioner had kept the said commission agreement with him after Mr Jaganathan had signed it. He also claimed at trial that the commission agreement could have been seized by the CPIB when they came to his house with a search warrant and took away some documents. The petitioner maintained at trial that the CPIB did not return any documents apart from the petitioner’s passport. However, I observed that despite the claim that the CPIB could have been in possession of the commission agreement at the time of the trial, the petitioner did not cross-examine the investigating officer from the CPIB regarding the whereabouts of this commission agreement.
20
       
 If the commission agreement had been of such importance to the petitioner’s case at trial, he should have been more diligent when he was offered the chance to cross-examine the CPIB investigating officer. Additionally, the trial itself stretched for a period of five to six months. During this period, the petitioner would have had ample time and opportunity to uncover the commission agreement. If the petitioner had been more diligent during this period of time, he would have been able to find the commission agreement as easily as he seemed to have at the time of this petition. This lack of diligence was especially glaring considering that the commission agreement was allegedly so crucial to the petitioner’s defence at trial.
21
       
 It was rather odd that the petitioner ran a new argument as to why he was unable to find the commission agreement, 
ie
, that he changed residences four times. For one, the petitioner did not mention this fact at trial. This indicated that the petitioner was now shifting from his original position and finding some excuse or other to explain away his lack of diligence at trial. For another, there was nothing in the petitioner’s skeletal arguments that explained or proved that there had 
indeed
 been four changes in residence that resulted in the commission agreement being misplaced. All that the petitioner provided was a bare assertion in his affidavit. This was not enough.
22
       
 It was therefore clear that the petitioner was not able to satisfactorily explain why the commission agreement could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at trial. As such, the petitioner failed at the very first hurdle of the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test. Nevertheless, even if the petitioner passed this first hurdle, he still failed with regard to the next condition.
Relevance
23
       
 The second hurdle of the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test requires the commission agreement to have had an important influence on the result of the case at trial, if it had been produced during the trial. The petitioner argued that the district judge relied heavily on the non-production of the commission agreement to convict him on the charge. Although the petitioner did not make this argument in relation to the condition of relevance, as understood within the meaning of 
Ladd v Marshall
, this was the only argument that came closest to assisting the petitioner at this stage.
24
       
 However, I found that the petitioner’s argument was not substantiated on a perusal of the district judge’s grounds of decision. Although the district judge made references to the commission agreement in her grounds of decision, the absence of the commission agreement was not the 
basis
 of her decision. At this juncture, it would be helpful to refer to s 420 PC:
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
and the charge against the petitioner at trial:
You, Selvarajoo s/o Malayappan Krishsamy Male, 49 years old S0011421I are charged that you, on or about the 20
th
 day of January 1993, at 26 Colchester Grove, Singapore, did cheat one Nagosri Uthirapathy Pillai [Mrs Jaganathan] of a sum of $14,000 by deceiving her into believing that one Lim Geok Lan, a Bank Manager in the employ of Overseas Union Trust Limited, had a share of the said $14,000 given as a reward for approving a mortgage loan of $350,000 when in actual fact the said Lim Geok Lan had no share and by such deception you have dishonestly induced the said Nagosri Uthirapathy Pillai into delivering to you a sum of $14,000 vide DBS cheque No: 220849, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code Act [
sic
] Cap 224.
25
       
 From the charge alone, it was apparent that it was the petitioner’s act of deceiving Mrs Jaganathan by representing that the $14,000 was for the purpose of commission sharing between Mdm Lim and himself (and thereby dishonestly inducing Mrs Jaganathan to part with the $14,000) that formed the basis of the charge (and the s 420 PC offence) and 
not the absence of a commission agreement
. The district judge found for a fact that the petitioner 
had
 made the representation to Mrs Jaganathan. She was therefore correct in convicting the petitioner on the charge. It was this particular finding of fact that was the basis of the district judge’s decision and I found no reason to reject the district judge’s finding. I accordingly upheld this finding.
26
       
 The newly discovered commission agreement would have only assisted the petitioner on the charge if it could have been used to prove that the petitioner 
had not made the oral representation
 to Mrs Jaganathan regarding the commission sharing. However, the commission agreement was only a written agreement with regard to a 4% commission that had to be paid by Mr Jaganathan. It did not state anything more that could have led me to find that the petitioner had not made the oral representation to Mrs Jaganathan. Therefore, the existence of the commission agreement did not change the most important aspect of the district judge’s grounds of decision.
27
       
 Accordingly, the petitioner failed to show how relevant the commission agreement would have been to the decision at trial. Although fresh evidence that was sought to be adduced need not have been decisive to the ultimate decision at trial, it must 
at least
 have had an important influence on the result of the case: 
Ladd v Marshall
. In this regard, I found that the commission agreement was incapable of having such an important influence on the result of the case, being a document that neither related directly to the charge and offence in question nor even served to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case at trial.
28
       
 As such, I found that the petitioner also failed at the second hurdle of the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I proceeded to consider the third condition.
Reliability
29
       
 At this third stage of the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test, the court must determine whether the evidence sought to be adduced is apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible. For instance, the authenticity of the commission agreement could go towards showing reliability.
30
       
 In this respect, by virtue of his affidavit under oath, the petitioner attested to the authenticity of the commission agreement. However, on a careful perusal of the notes of evidence and the commission agreement itself, I found that the commission agreement did not satisfy the reliability condition. The commission agreement was dated 12 November 1992. This was the date on which the petitioner had brought Mr and Mrs Jaganathan to OUT to apply for the mortgage refinancing loan. The loan itself was approved on 17 November 1992. However, at trial, the petitioner testified that it was not his practice to execute the commission agreement before the bank had presented a letter of offer (the bank had presented to the Jaganathans a letter of offer dated 17 November 1992). The petitioner also testified that he made Mr Jaganathan sign the commission agreement only after the bank had presented this letter of offer. I reproduce the relevant portions of the notes of evidence:
Notes of Evidence p 86, para A: Examination-in-chief of petitioner
Q:
        
 Did you execute commission agreement with anyone before go to bank?
A:
        
 First time go to bank, Mdm Lim interview both of them in my presence. 
Normally when letter of offer is ready, then sign agreement for commission. That is my practice
. No point signing first day. Bank may not accept.
Notes of Evidence p 86, paras E to F: Examination-in-chief of petitioner
Q:
        
 All of you left?
A:
        
 Yes, they drop me at my house. A few days later Mdm Lim call me, application successful. Bank granted $350,000. She said already called Mrs Nathan before me. One or two days we go back to sign. Before that I ask them to come to my house, sign commission agreement. I showed copy of agent commission agreement to the husband. Then he show to wife, wife read, then husband signed. Only husband signed.
Notes of Evidence p 96, paras B to D: Cross-examination of petitioner
Q:
        
 First meeting – you discuss commission?
A:
        
 I said 4% I’m agreeable.
Q:
        
 They didn’t sign anything at this point?
A:
        
 First meeting no.
Q:
        
 Sign document second meeting?
A:
        
 Yes.
Q:
        
 After went to bank first time?
A:
        
 Right.
[emphasis added]
Here, the references to the “first meeting” in the notes of evidence were in relation to the date on which the petitioner brought Mr and Mrs Jaganathan to OUT 
ie
 12 November 1992. This was also the date on which the application for the loan was made by Mr and Mrs Jaganathan in the presence of the petitioner and Mdm Lim.
31
       
 From these pieces of evidence, it was clear that the commission agreement sought to be adduced did not sit well with the petitioner’s testimony at trial. There was conflict in the relevant dates. Although this conflict might not have been enough to rule that the commission agreement was an inauthentic or a falsified document, it should be held against the petitioner, as he effectively caused the conflict with his inconsistent positions from the time of the trial to the current petition.
32
       
 On top of this, I noted that in 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
 I had stated at [31] that “[a]dditional evidence should not be admitted unless it may be accepted as apparently credible without the need for further proof”. In the present situation, the commission agreement was not apparently credible due to the crucial conflict in dates. Further proof would probably be required to show that the commission agreement was itself apparently credible. The situation being such, I found that I could not safely rely on the commission agreement as a credible document. Consequently, I found that the commission agreement failed to meet the condition of reliability.
33
       
 In all, I found that the petitioner failed to overcome all three hurdles in the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test and was therefore unable to show why the commission agreement should be adduced as fresh evidence. Accordingly, I held that the commission agreement could not be adduced in evidence. With the commission agreement now incapable of being adduced, I found that the petitioner’s 
basis
 for the criminal revision had disappeared. Thus, the petition for criminal revision must also be dismissed. Nevertheless, even if the commission agreement 
was
 admissible in evidence, the criminal revision would still have been dismissed. I now explain why this would be the case.
In the event that the commission agreement is admissible as evidence, would the petition for criminal revision still be allowed
34
       
 I had already found that the basis of the district judge’s decision was not the commission agreement but the oral representation made by the petitioner to Mrs Jaganathan. The petitioner attempted to place undue importance on the commission agreement to elevate it as the focal point of the district judge’s decision. However, from her grounds of decision, it was clear that the district judge convicted the petitioner for having deceived or dishonestly induced Mrs Jaganathan into handing over $14,000 by representing that the sum was to be shared, as commission, by himself and Mdm Lim.
35
       
 The district judge made a finding of fact that Mrs Jaganathan was truthful in her account of the petitioner’s representation regarding the commission sharing. Additionally, she found that Mdm Lim’s testimony corroborated Mrs Jaganathan’s testimony in relation to the representation, albeit a weak form of corroboration. The testimonies of Mrs Jaganathan and Mdm Lim pertaining to the representation on commission sharing were more crucial to the district judge’s decision, as opposed to the commission agreement. The petitioner was unable to show otherwise.
36
       
 As such, even if the commission agreement were to be admitted as evidence, the petition for criminal revision would still be dismissed, as the petitioner’s conviction was based on a different reason. The petitioner thus failed to show that some “serious injustice [had] been caused” to him as a result of the initial non-production of the commission agreement, warranting the exercise of this court’s powers of revision: 
Teo Hee Heng v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 168
, which followed the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
.
37
       
 That being stated, I must add that I observed a disturbing attitude that had been adopted by the petitioner. In his skeletal arguments, the petitioner had used rather strong, harsh and unwarranted language against the Jaganathans. In light of that, it was apparent that this petition for criminal revision was an attempt by the petitioner to seek personal revenge against the Jaganathans, rather than as a means to quash his conviction. For one, the petitioner’s arguments revolved only around the uncovering of the commission agreement, an issue that clearly ran at a tangent to the district judge’s 
ratio decidendi
. For another, the petitioner alleged throughout his skeletal arguments that the Jaganathans had, among other things, “lied”, “perjured”, “misled the trial judge”, displayed “vindictiveness” and gone “on a vengeance path”. These were serious allegations that had been loosely made without any reasonable basis.
38
       
 Further, the petitioner had accused the district judge of drawing “prejudicial conclusions” without explaining where such prejudice was found in the grounds of decision. All of these accusations were without merit. As much as a criminal revision should not be used as a convenient form of “back door appeal”, it should also not be abused as an avenue to seek revenge or satiate the ego of a petitioner. Any suggestion of a trend in bringing appeals or criminal revisions for the main purpose of tarnishing the reputation of another party should be nipped at an early stage.
39
       
 In conclusion, my reasons for dismissing this petition for criminal revision were two-fold. First, the commission agreement upon which the petitioner had based this criminal revision failed to meet the three conditions enshrined in 
Ladd v Marshall
 and therefore could not be adduced as fresh evidence. Second, even if the commission agreement could be adduced as fresh evidence, the district judge’s decision was not based on the existence or non-existence of the commission agreement. The district judge had come to her decision based on the charge the Prosecution had proceeded on at trial and she had made well-supported findings of fact that substantiated her conclusion. I found no cogent reasons to overturn her findings.

27 February 2004
 
District Judge Audrey Lim:
1          The accused, N, faced 12 charges comprising offences under s 354 and s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224), against two boys.  At the start of the trial, the prosecution applied to stand down three charges pertaining to one of the boys, and proceeded on the remaining nine charges pertaining to the other.  I convicted N on all nine charges and sentenced him to a term of 30 months’ imprisonment in total.  Being dissatisfied, he appealed against the conviction and sentence. 
2          At the material time, the accused was a boy scouts leader at a school, where V was a scout.  He was charged with two counts of outraging V’s modesty (the 1
st
 and 4
th
 charges); six counts of committing acts of gross indecency by touching V’s penis; and one count of committing an act of gross indecency by using V’s hand to touch his penis (the 9
th
 charge).  
3          The prosecution applied for the hearing to be in camera and a prohibition on publication of anything that might lead to the identification of the victim.  I granted the application and accordingly the identity of the accused, victim, witnesses and any other information which may lead to the identification of the victim have been omitted from my written decision. 
Some background
4          N was a lawyer who had practised in the private and public sector.  Sometime in 1984 or 1985, he became the boy scouts adult leader at his alma mater.  He came to know V when V joined the scouts in February 2001.  At that time N was about 35 years old, and V was 13 years old and a student in Secondary 1.
1
st
 charge – Pulau Ubin, November 2001
5          On 10 November 2001, the scouts camped overnight at Pulau Ubin.  They were divided into groups of about four, and had to perform night sentry duty. At about 3.00 am, whilst V and another scout, Y, were seated on a poncho performing sentry duty, N approached them to chat. 
6          According to V, N was seated on his left, and Y was on V’s right and seated slightly in front of V.  Whilst talking to V and Y, N placed both hands over V’s body to hug and lower him on the poncho and then kissed him intermittently on both cheeks for about 20 minutes.  In cross-examination, V was unsure whether N had kissed him on both cheeks or only one cheek.  Although V felt uneasy, frightened and did not want to be kissed, he did not resist, as he thought that N was being friendly towards him.  He also did not know how to react or avoid being kissed, as he was afraid of N who was his scouts leader.  At that time, V was not sure if Y was awake or had witnessed the incident.  After kissing V, N continued to talk to them, and subsequently left.  There were two other scouts in V’s tent that night, but they were asleep at the material time. Despite being unhappy about the incident throughout the camp, V did not show it as he did not want anyone to know what had happened.  He also did not inform anyone of this incident until the police interviewed him in May 2002.
7          Y confirmed that he was seated on the poncho with V, performing sentry duty, when N approached and talked to them.  The three of them sat on the poncho, with V in the middle.   Thereafter N told them to lie down and rest.  Y found this unusual as N had earlier informed all the scouts to take their sentry duties seriously and not to sleep whilst performing their duties.  Y then lay down, and he saw N push V down on the poncho with one hand and with the other arm behind V’s back to support him.  Y could not recall what happened thereafter, as he fell asleep almost immediately after lying down.  The other two scouts (one of them being L) who were not performing sentry duty then, were fast asleep in the tent.  This was confirmed by L. 
8          According to N, his role was to check on the scouts to ensure that they were safe and performing their sentry duties.  Should one of the scouts fail to perform his duty properly, the whole patrol could be punished.  Moreover, if he saw any scout asleep whilst on duty, he would have woken him up.  When he arrived at V’s tent sometime after midnight, V and Y were seated on the poncho doing their duty.  N spoke to them for a while before sitting on the poncho.  Both V and Y were wide awake and conversing with him throughout the time he was there, for about one to two hours.  All throughout, V was seated and not lying down, and Y was seated most of the time.   N denied that he had asked or made V lie down on the poncho, or that he had hugged and kissed him.  Moreover N observed V to be cheerful and normal the next day.
2
nd
 charge – Pasir Ris Park, 1 December 2001
9          Shortly after the Pulau Ubin trip, the scouts were involved in an activity at Pasir Ris Park (‘the Park’) on 1 December 2001.  There was a gathering of about 60 scouts to announce new post-holders for 2002, and V was appointed the new treasurer.  Sometime past midnight, whilst he was playing cards, another scout, K, asked him to see N.  V then went to look for N and N led him to a hut.  K confirmed that N had asked him to inform a scout to meet him that night, but he could not recall who this person was.
10        Whilst seated beside V in the hut, N placed his hand on V’s back and made him lie down on the floor plank of the hut. V did not know why N did that, and did not want to tell him.   He was afraid to disobey N, and did not know how N might react if V tried to push him away.   They then had a conversation on V’s new post as treasurer and other scout matters. 
11        Suddenly N placed his hand into V’s shorts outside his underwear, and started fondling his penis for at least five minutes, whilst they continued chatting.  Thereafter they left the hut together for the toilet, and V then went back to play with the other scouts.  V felt uneasy and frightened when N was fondling his penis.  However he did not react at that time, as he was shocked by the unexpected act, and N was his scouts leader whom he respected.  Again V did not inform anyone about the incident until he was interviewed by the police in May 2002, as it was shameful and he did not want to face up to it.   
12        V could not recall how the hut looked like, as he did not really observe.  He described it as having an A-shaped roof which extended to the ground, and both sides of the hut were completely open.  He was also unsure of which hand N had used to touch his penis.
13        N explained that the new appointment holders were decided by the teachers-in-charge, the Junior College scouts and N.  N arrived at the Park at about 8.00 pm or 9.00 pm and spoke to the new appointment holders on their respective roles.  He spoke to the appointment holders, whose roles were similar, in groups.  These included the patrol leaders and assistant patrol leaders, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, test coordinators, and the secretary and liaison officers.  However he spoke to V alone as V was the only treasurer.
14        N said that he spoke to V in the hut (shown in 
exhibit D2, photos 1-2
) at around 3.00 am, for about 30 minutes to an hour, on his role as treasurer.  He could not recall if he met V in the hut, or elsewhere and brought him to the hut.  At that time, a lot of members of the public were around the hut area, including the scouts.  Initially N was seated leaning against the wall of the hut and V was seated opposite, facing him.  In the course of the conversation, V moved and leaned against the same wall beside N.
15        N denied that he had fondled V’s penis.   However, he did accompany V to the toilet after they had finished talking, and subsequently joined the other scouts at some benches nearby.  Apart from V, he had not intended to nor did he speak to other scouts alone, except for those who had approached him on their own after he had finished his conversation with V.

th
 charges – Visits to N’s home in December 2001
16        After the above incidents, N invited V to his home.  According to V, nothing unusual happened on the first occasion.  On the second visit, N brought V to his room and locked the door.  He then switched on the computer to check for e-mails whilst V sat on his bed.  After a while, N switched on the television, told V to lie down, and both of them lay on the bed to watch television.  At that time, it did not occur to V that N would do anything to him.  Suddenly N hugged and kissed V, unzipped his shorts and stroked and fondled his penis.  Although V was disgusted and angry, he did not know how to react or tell N, as he respected him and did not dare to disobey him.  He was also afraid that their scouts relationship might be jeopardised.  This incident occurred for a short while, and thereafter they continued watching television before N sent V home.
17        V visited N the third time in the same month.  Again N invited him into his room, closed the door and hugged and kissed V whilst he was standing, but did not touch his penis.  Once again, V was not brave enough to object.  On all three visits, V claimed that it was N who had invited him and brought him there.  He did not dare to object to the visits or disobey N, whom he regarded as his teacher.  However, despite what had happened, V did not completely lose respect for N, and he tried not to remind himself of the incidents. 
18        N admitted that he would bring V out and send him home.  The first occasion was on 15 December 2001, where he brought V to his home to pick up his family for dinner.  N recalled that V visited his home on two other occasions in December 2001.  Upon arriving home, N would normally check for e-mails on his computer, whilst his guests sat on his bed and entertained themselves.  When V visited his home the second time in December, he could not recall what he was doing, but it was probable that V was watching television whilst seated on N’s bed and N subsequently joined him and chatted with him.  However he denied ever hugging and kissing V, or fondling his penis.

th
 charge – Visit to N’s home on 2 February 2002
19        The next occasion that V visited N was on 2 February 2002.  N had invited him and another scout, L, for dinner.  When they arrived, they went into N’s bedroom to play on the Playstation.  Thereafter, they had dinner and went back into the room to continue their game whilst seated on N’s bed.  N then came into the room and sat behind V and proceeded to stroke V’s penis inside his underwear, with a blanket covering V’s shorts and N’s hand, whilst L was playing on the Playstation.  This time, V was angry and felt that N had gone overboard.  However, he did not complain to anyone.  Thereafter, N sent V and L home.    
20        L confirmed that N had invited him to his home to play Playstation.  He played with V in N’s room before and after dinner.  Whilst playing after dinner, he was seated on the bed nearer the television, and N and V were seated behind him.  He heard V let out a grunt, like an “umph” or said something akin to “no”, and he turned around and saw V nudging N away with his arm or shoulder. At that time, V and N were seated side by side, with their bodies in contact.  After being nudged, N moved away from V.  L then continued with his game, and V joined him for a while before N sent them home.
21        N stated that he had invited V and L to his home together with N’s relatives and another friend.  He brought V and L there and when they arrived, they played Playstation in his room.  After dinner, V and L continued with their game, whilst seated on N’s bed.  At times both of them would play together and at times only one would play whilst the other watched.   N could not recall any occasion where he sat next to V, although he might have done so.
22        N denied that he had fondled V’s penis under a blanket.  All throughout, the blanket was folded and placed under his pillow and bolster which were at the headrest.  He also claimed that his body never came into contact with V’s whilst in the room.  At most he had tapped the two boys when he first entered the room, to enquire about the game.  V’s allegation was unbelievable as he could have alerted L if such a thing had happened, and would not have continued playing thereafter.  Moreover, when N sent them home, V was happily chatting away.
Chinese New Year reunion dinner at V’s home – 11 February 2002
23        Subsequently N visited V for the Chinese New Year reunion dinner, although V could not recall who had invited him.  V explained that although he would not visit N again after the last abuse, he might invite N to his home when others were around as he did not think that N would abuse him in their presence.  
24        According to N, after he had finished his family reunion dinner at about 7.00 pm that day, he received an Internet message from V inviting him to join V’s family for a reunion dinner.  N declined as he had just eaten his dinner, whereupon he received a call from V’s mum who insisted that he went.  Hence N agreed.  He arrived at V’s home at about 8.30 pm.  On that night V was normal and rather jovial due to the joyous occasion.   Subsequently N visited V again during Chinese New Year.

th
 charge – N’s visit to V’s home, March 2002
25        In March 2002, V stated that N asked for his permission to visit and bring food for him.  At that time, V was alone at home. When N arrived, he asked V what he was doing and V told him that he was doing a project on the computer in his room, whereupon N offered to help.  N sat on V’s right, facing the computer table, and whilst giving V advice on his work, he placed his left hand into V’s shorts and started to masturbate him for about one to two minutes.  V was shocked but did not stop N as N was his scouts leader.  V then ejaculated, and N tried to clean up with some tissue and led V to the toilet.  Thereafter they went back to V’s room, and N continued to chat with V for a short while.  Just before leaving, N gave V a hug and kiss whilst in the hall.  Although this incident was quite serious, V did not dare to inform anyone.  V explained that he had allowed N to visit him on this occasion, although he had been abused previously, because he thought that N was merely going to pass him the food and leave.
26        N claimed that on that day, he was having lunch and called V about scouts matters.  V then informed him that he had not eaten and N offered to bring him food.  When N arrived, V invited him in and they went to the kitchen where V ate whilst N chatted with him.  N denied that he had offered to help V with his work and claimed that V had invited N to his room on his own volition.  N sat beside V at the computer and helped him with his work.  He spent about two hours in V’s home that day, but denied having molested V.

th
 charge – N’s visit to V’s home with Australian gifts, 19 May 2002
27        On 19 May 2002, N visited V again as he had just returned from Australia and wanted to give him some scouts souvenirs.  Once again, V invited him into his room.   N sat on his right and again placed his left hand into V’s shorts and touched his penis.  Just as N was doing this, V’s mum, Mdm L, arrived home and looked into the room to see what V was doing, whereupon N stopped his act.  Mdm L then went to take a shower and N placed his hand into V’s shorts again.  When Mdm L finished her shower and went to check on V again, N quickly pulled his hand out of V’s shorts.  Thereafter, N went into the hall and showed Mdm L the gifts that he had bought for V. In cross-examination, V stated that he could not recall whether N did anything before Mdm L arrived home, but recalled that after she came home, N did touch his penis. 
28        After N left, Mdm L asked V if anything had happened and V told her that N had touched his penis.  V then informed Mdm L, for the first time, that N had on previous occasions done something similar when he visited N and had touched his penis before.  However V did not elaborate, nor mention that some of the abuses occurred at Pulau Ubin and Pasir Ris, as Mdm L did not ask him in detail where the incidents took place.  Mdm L then told V to avoid N.  Although V did not like N’s abuses, he was too afraid to tell N to stop.  V explained that he had allowed N into his home and accepted his gifts because he did not expect N to abuse him again.
29        N stated that towards the end of March to early April, he took V out on a few occasions.  However, from mid-April until his return from Australia, N avoided V as he was annoyed and angry with him for not performing his duties.  V had failed to collect fees for scouts activities, send important e-mails and maintain the fish tank in the scouts den.   It was not a happy period of their relationship.  The fish tank project began around January 2002.  N alleged that V was the de facto leader, in charge of the fish tank with three other scouts.  N also sent e-mails to the four scouts to voice his displeasure and reprimanded them for failing to maintain the tank properly 
(exhibit D6, pages 1-2)
.   On 7 May, N left for Australia. 
30        After his return on 13 May, he visited V on 19 May to pass him some souvenirs. V led him to his room and N sat next to him at the computer table.  When N discovered that V had not taken any remedial action with regard to the fish tank as promised, N was very upset and angry with V.  In addition, V had also failed to collect fees for the coming scouts Annual Camp.  N raised his voice and scolded V for about 10 minutes, and told him to send out a reminder to the scouts that day, which V promptly did the same night 
(exhibit D6, page 5)
.   When V was scolded, he was visibly upset and disappointed.
31        Whilst they were in the room, Mdm L arrived home and came to the doorway of V’s room.  At that time, N was seated very close to and slightly facing V, who was facing the computer.  The doorway of the room was perpendicular to the computer table and their sitting position.  N explained that when he heard her voice and saw her, he quickly turned his whole body to greet her.  Whilst turning his body, he swung his left hand from his stool or lap to his chest level, but he could not recall if he had done so to gesture to her.  Mdm L then walked away and N continued to sit with V.  Sometime later N went to the living room to talk to Mdm L and they subsequently left the flat together.   N denied that he had molested V that day.

th
 charges - Scouts Annual Camp at school, 24 May 2002
32        Shortly after, V attended the scouts Annual Camp held in the school field from 24 to 29 May 2002.  The various patrol tents were lined up in a row at one end of the field.  N’s tent was at one end and V’s patrol tent was next to N’s.  On the night of 24 May (‘day zero’), V was in his tent about to sleep, when N approached and asked him to come out.   N then held V’s hand and brought him out of the tent, towards another patrol tent.  K was lying on a poncho just outside that tent, when N pushed V onto K.  However V managed to avoid landing on top of K.  V explained that when N initially held his hand to lead him out of his tent, the memories of the previous molest incidents did not come to mind, as N was not leading him towards N’s own tent and hence V felt at ease.
33        After that, N led V towards his own tent and told V to sit in the tent with him.  V informed N that he wanted to go back to his patrol tent to sleep but N told him that he could stay in his tent instead.  N then started to talk to V about his weaknesses as a scout and told him to be more responsible in his duties. At that time, N did not appear to be very angry and V could not recall if N had scolded him.  After a while, V fell asleep in the tent as he was tired.
34        In cross-examination, V stated that when he saw N leading him towards his tent, he was afraid that N might abuse him again and told N that he wanted to go back to his own tent to sleep, whereupon N said never mind.  However, once he was inside N’s tent, he did not think that N would abuse him again, as N did not evince such an intention whilst they were talking in the tent.
35        In the middle of the night, whilst V was asleep, he felt something touching his penis.  Although he was half-asleep, he opened his eyes and saw that it was N.  He then closed his eyes for fear that N might know that he was conscious.  N was masturbating him by stroking his penis, and his shorts and underwear were pulled down.  Soon after, V ejaculated and N then used V’s hand to stroke N’s penis.  Throughout V was frightened and did not dare to do anything. 
36        When V woke up the next day at about 7.00 am, he did not see N at the campsite.  That morning, he informed a scout, C, in the presence of another scout, M, that N had touched his penis.  He also subsequently informed another scout, P, the incident in brief, as P had heard about it from either C or M and came to verify it with V.
37        Having had enough of N’s abuses, V decided to inform his mum at the barbecue to be held on the night of 28 May for the parents.  He did not complain to his mother immediately after the incident as he did not have a handphone with him and was not allowed to communicate with parents whilst at the Annual Camp.  When Mdm L came on 28 May for the barbecue, V told her briefly what had happened.  Upon Mdm L’s request, they related the matter to the teacher in-charge of scouts, Mr Lim, who referred the matter to Mr Chow.  The matter was then brought to the headmaster’s attention and the school subsequently reported it to the police. 
38        Some of the other scouts also testified on this incident.  K stated that on the night of day zero, he was lying asleep on a poncho outside V’s patrol tent, with Y beside him.  He was awaken by some shuffling noise and he saw V and N in front of him.  N was giggling and whispering into V’s ear and he pushed V onto K.  However V managed to avoid K and fell beside him instead.  V then stood up and N led him by his hand towards N’s tent.  Thereafter K went back to sleep.  The next morning, C approached K and told him about the incident between V and N in N’s tent the night before.  K then confirmed this with V, and informed another scout, in V’s presence. 
39        C, who was in the same patrol as V, recalled that he was seated on the poncho outside the patrol tent (which was next to N’s tent) on the night of day zero, when he saw N leading V out of the tent by his wrist.  V and N were holding hands and moving around the campsite before N brought V into N’s tent at about 12 midnight to 1.00 am.  Thereafter C went to sleep.  The next morning he went with some of the scouts to look for V, as he was curious to find out what had happened the night before when he did not see V return to their patrol tent.  C found V in N’s tent and asked V what happened.  V looked very nervous and embarrassed, and explained that N was alone with him in the tent the night before and he felt someone touching and breathing over his private part, and kissing his face and lips.  V said that he was very afraid and did not dare to do anything.  C approached their patrol leader, M, and led M to V, whereupon V recounted the incident to M in C’s presence.   C then informed K and some other scouts about the incident. 
40        M stated that before he went to sleep on day zero, he was informed that V was with N in N’s tent.  The next morning C and M went to wake V up in N’s tent and asked him what he was doing there.  V explained that N had brought him to his tent and spoke to him there, when he felt sleepy and dozed off.  Whilst asleep, he felt something hot in his groin area and someone breathing on him.  He was too afraid to open his eyes.
41        P similarly testified that on the morning of 25 May, he asked V what had happened and V informed him that he felt someone masturbating him and a warm breath over his groin area.  Y explained that on 25 May, he saw that V looked rather distracted and hence he approached K, whereupon K told him briefly about the incident that had happened between V and N the night before.  According to Y, K was informed of the incident by C who had heard it from V. 
42        Mr Lim, who was then the teacher in charge of the scouts, recalled that on the night of the barbecue, Mdm L approached him and told him about the incident between N and V.  Mr Lim then verified and confirmed the story with V.  According to V, N had led him by his arm and pushed him onto K who was on the poncho with Y.  However V managed to avoid landing on K.  V was then taken to N’s tent where he was kissed and his private part was touched.  When V was recounting the event, he was quite calm and did not look very distressed or upset, although he was rather uncomfortable relating the incident.   V also recounted to Mr Lim the incident at Pulau Ubin where he was kissed or hugged, and the occasions when N brought V out and put his hand on V’s thigh in the car.  Mdm L then told Mr Lim the incident where she saw N pull his hand from inside V’s shorts in V’s room.
43        After the matter was brought to the school’s attention, Mr Justin, who was the head of the pupil welfare department, spoke to V on a few occasions.  He wanted to ascertain V’s psychological state, to counsel and find out how V was coping and feeling.  V informed him that during the Annual Camp, N had asked him to go to his tent and lie down.   V was then kissed on his cheeks and lips, his shorts were pulled down and he was masturbated.  V did not say anything then as he was frightened.  When asked if N had acted inappropriately towards V previously, V informed Mr Justin that N had ever molested him at Pulau Ubin in 2001 by kissing him on his cheeks and lips.
44        The deputy headmaster of the school, Mr S, testified that when the incident at the Annual Camp was brought to his attention, he met with the headmaster and Mr Lim, and they decided to make a police report. Mr S also informed N that the school took a serious view of the complaint and would suspend his service with immediate effect.  N denied the allegations and informed Mr S that he would resign. As such the school suspended N, and he simultaneously resigned.  Mr S also testified that the parents of V and the other scouts, whose names had surfaced during the school investigations into the complaint, were reluctant to make a police report.  They wanted the school to deal with the matter internally, as they did not want their children to be involved in police investigations and have their identities exposed.  
45        N’s version of events on the night of day zero is as follows.  He went to speak to the weaker scouts and approached V’s tent and invited him out to speak to him.  N wanted to talk about V’s leadership abilities and his performance, and did not want the other scouts to hear such confidential matters.  V emerged from his tent, and whilst N was holding V’s arm, they walked around the campsite to find a place to sit and discuss V’s performance.  However they were unable to find a place as the site was littered with scouts paraphernalia. 
46        At around 12.00 midnight, N led V into his tent and whilst they were seated inside, N told V in a fierce tone, about his lacklustre performance and weaknesses.  V was rather disappointed.  Whilst N was talking for about half an hour, V fell asleep in the tent and N thus left and went to another patrol tent to sleep.  N did not see V again until about 8.00 am the next morning at the scouts roll call, and V looked rather cheerful and normal for the rest of the Camp.
47        Again N denied that he had molested V as he had left the tent immediately after V fell asleep and did not return to his tent that night.  N also did not invite nor on his own initiative inform V that he could sleep in his tent. N claimed that V made the allegations against him because he was embarrassed at being discovered by the other scouts in N’s tent the next morning.  When Mr S subsequently informed him of the allegations, he told Mr S that he wanted them to be investigated by the police to clear his name.  Mr S also informed him that he would be suspended whereupon he offered to resign.
48        N further suggested that V had made up all the allegations because he was upset with N for scolding him on numerous occasions. V and the other scouts were also very unhappy with him for suspending two scouts in July 2001, and V had been informed by N at the Annual Camp that he would not be considered for higher positions of responsibility in view of his weak performance.  Hence V had fabricated these allegations of abuse to remove him from scouts.  
49        Although V admitted that he was rather unhappy with one of the scouts’ suspension, namely F, he did not bear a grudge against N, as he did not think that N had wrongly suspended F.  V also denied that he had fabricated all these incidents because he was unhappy with N. V stated that his relationship with N in the later part of 2001 until early 2002 was close.  From March 2002, V was not very happy with N after he started molesting him.  V admitted that he did not perform his tasks properly, such as looking after the fish tank and failing to collect fees for the Annual Camp in May 2002.    Although N had chided him once or twice for failing to send out important emails, V did not think that N was very annoyed or angry with him.   V described N as a strict, stern and no-nonsense scout leader, and he respected N for this.
Mdm L’s testimony
50        Mdm L testified that N first came to her home for a Chinese New Year reunion dinner in 2002.  It was N who wanted to visit them as he had never been to their home before.  Hence Mdm L invited him to their reunion dinner. 
51        As for the incidents of abuse, V had ever told Mdm L that when he went to N’s home with another scout, N had touched his penis under a blanket which was covering the three of them.  When Mdm L heard this, she told V that N was merely playing with him.  At that time, she did not realise the seriousness of the matter, and thought that N was merely playing with V as another scout was present.  Mdm L could not recall when V had informed her of this incident, but it was sometime after Chinese New Year.
52        On another occasion Mdm L witnessed N pulling his hand out of V’s shorts in V’s room.  This was when N came to give V the gifts that he had bought from Australia.  On that day, she had come home from work to take a shower. She walked towards V’s room and as she stood at V’s doorway, she witnessed N pulling his hand quickly out of V’s shorts.   She could not recall which hand it was.  At that time, N was seated closer to the doorway and V was seated beside him, at the computer table.  N was surprised to see Mdm L at the doorway when she appeared, and after retracting his hand from V’s shorts, he turned his face to look at Mdm L.   Sometime after Mdm L had taken her shower, N and her left the flat together chatting in a friendly manner. She did not confront N then as she was unsure of what he had done, although her suspicions were aroused.
53        However, on the same evening or the next day, she confronted V to ask him what had happened.  V said that N had “anyhow touched him” and had touched his penis, whereupon Mdm L told V to try to avoid N as much as possible.  She did not inform anyone of this incident as N was V’s scouts teacher and she was afraid that he might create trouble for V or affect V’s performance in scouts.
54        The next incident that Mdm L recalled was at the Annual Camp in May 2002.  During the Camp, V called Mdm L to come to the barbecue.  When Mdm L declined, V asked her why.  Detecting something wrong in his tone of voice, Mdm L changed her mind and said that she would attend.  When she arrived, V looked anxious and the first thing he said was, “Mummy, why didn’t you report to the police?”  Mdm L then asked what had happened whereupon V told her that N had asked him to go to his tent where he fell asleep.  He then felt someone in contact with his body, kissing his lips, a warm sensation, and someone sucking or touching his penis.  N also used V’s hand to touch N’s penis.  At the time of the incident, V was very tired and in a semi-conscious state.
55        On hearing this, Mdm L was very angry and they went to see Mr Lim and related the matter to him.  Mr Lim then approached Mr Chow and they informed her that the matter would be referred to the school authorities.  The school then informed Mdm L that they would expel N, and subsequently reported the matter to the police.  Mdm L explained that she merely wanted the school to expel N, and did not want to lodge a police report as she was afraid that the matter would be blown up.
N’s long statement (exhibit P10)
56        In the course of N’s cross-examination, the prosecution produced N’s statement made on 21 August 2002 (
exhibit P10
), the voluntariness of which was not challenged, to impeach N.  I will deal with the statement in my decision.
Observations of N and V’s character by the other witnesses
57        In general, all the scouts who testified stated that N was a strict and stern scouts leader.   Y described N as a well-respected scouts leader, who was strict and expected the scouts to perform their tasks well.  L said that N was a good advisor and very strict disciplinarian, and he expected everyone to do their best.  P similarly found N to be strict and would not hesitate to punish the scouts for failing to follow orders.  C stated that the scouts were rather afraid of N, and M agreed that N would not hesitate to be strict with the scouts where there was a need.  Even Mr Lim agreed that N was a competent and able scouts leader, with a high standard of discipline.
58        As for V, K and M observed him to be a quiet and shy person.  L agreed that V was a quiet and reserved person who hardly talked and had few close friends.  P similarly testified that V came across as quiet and not outspoken.  C said that V was an introvert, a very reserved person, did not speak his mind and mostly kept to himself.  However Y found him to be a lively and chatty person, but became quiet and withdrawn after the Annual Camp in May 2002.  Even Mdm L testified that V was a quiet boy, who was not very active and “dared not to resist”. Mr Justin, who spoke to V a few times after the school report was made, observed V to be quiet by nature, but forthright and unhesitant in answering questions.
59        As for N and V’s relationship, K observed that N paid particular attention to V and was always around him during scouts activities.  K had also seen N hug V, whisper into his ears and tickle him. However it appeared to K, sometime in late 2001, that N was imposing his friendship on V as V was not very comfortable in his presence.  Once, he saw N hugging V, and holding him on his lap with his arm supporting V’s back whilst seated, at a scouts camp in March 2002. V seemed rather afraid or uncomfortable with N’s gestures and tried unsuccessfully to push N away.  
60        L testified that N was very close to some of the scouts such as himself and V, and had brought them out and given them gifts.   L had also seen N put his arm around V’s shoulder or hold V’s head affectionately.  Similarly, C and M had noticed that during scouts activities N and V would sometimes hold hands and N would put his arm around V’s shoulder.  V had ever informed C on a few occasions that he was not comfortable with and did not like the way N treated him.  C further observed that V would shy away when N tried to put his arm over V’s shoulder or hold his hand.  However, none of the scouts had known of any occasion where N was angry with V. 
61        On the other hand, N described V as chatty, talkative, playful and mischievous.  He came to know V well at the end of 2001, and V started confiding in him until around April 2002.  He admitted that he had put his hand around V’s shoulders on many occasions as a friendly gesture, and on his thigh.
My decision
62        It was not disputed that N and V were together at the time of the incidents, save for the incident at the Annual Camp in May 2002, where N claimed that he had left his tent after V fell asleep.  The issue to be determined was whether the acts were committed as alleged by V.  If they were, then it was clear that N had the necessary mens rea, as he admitted that it would have been wrong to hug and kiss V as it would have outraged V’s modesty.  Likewise if N had touched V’s penis or use V’s hand to touch his penis, he would certainly have committed an act of gross indecency under s 377A, in which consent was not a required element of the offence–

, it is important to weight the evidence carefully, bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and behaviour.  It would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities, especially when it has no logical bearing to the problem at hand.
64        Having scrutinised the evidence and observed the demeanour of the witnesses, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.   I pause to make some brief preliminary observations on the witnesses’ demeanours in court.  Overall I found V to be truthful and forthright, and answered questions without hesitation.  This was unlike N, who was dishonest and evasive in his testimony.  As for the other scouts, although their recollection of the various events were imperfect, I accepted them as witnesses of truth who had no reason to lie.  I will now deal with each event in turn.

st
 charge – Pulau Ubin, November 2001
65        It was not disputed that when N approached V and Y whilst they were performing sentry duty, the other two scouts in V’s tent were asleep.  This was confirmed by Y and L.   I believed V that N had lowered him down on the poncho and then kissed him on his cheeks, although V could not recall whether it was on one or both cheeks.   In fact, Y, who was seated on the same poncho, testified that N had told them to lie down and rest, which he found unusual as they were supposed to be performing sentry duty.  Y corroborated V’s testimony as he witnessed N pushing V down on the poncho with one hand, whilst using the other arm to support V.  I accepted that Y then fell asleep and did not know what transpired between V and N thereafter.
66        This was diametrically opposed to N’s testimony, which I rejected.  He claimed that V and Y were awake all throughout, that V was seated throughout and not lying down, and that he had not lowered V on the poncho.  I found that Y had no reason to lie. It was not in his interest to fall asleep or admit that he had fallen asleep, especially when N had informed the scouts to take their sentry duty seriously.  As N had stated, the whole patrol could get into trouble if one scout failed to perform his duty.  Moreover, there was no evidence that Y bore a grudge against N.  Although V may have been unsure or mistaken as to whether Y was awake when the incident occurred, this did not materially affect the prosecution’s case, as Y had truthfully admitted that he did not know what transpired after he fell asleep.
67        Why then, did N deny that he had asked or made the scouts lie down on the poncho to rest, when this was contrary to his instructions to them to perform their sentry duty seriously?  Why did N claim that Y was awake throughout, and when Y fell asleep, he did not wake him up?  N stated that if he had found any scout asleep whilst performing his duty, he would wake him up, which would be consistent with his general character as a strict scouts master who expected his scouts to perform their duties properly.
68        I could not but draw the irresistible inference that he had lied about his actions, to conceal his true intention when he had asked them to lie down and rest.  I found that N had asked them to lie down to lull them into a sense of complacency, hoping to take advantage of V at an opportune moment, undetected.  This moment presented itself when Y fell asleep, and N left him undisturbed whilst he molested V.

nd
 charge – Pasir Ris Park, 1 December 2001
69        As for the incident at Pasir Ris Park, I again accepted V’s testimony that N had made him lie down and then fondled his penis inside his shorts, at a hut. It was not disputed that at some point in the hut, they were seated beside each other leaned against the wall. Hence, it was not impossible for N to have fondled V’s penis as V had described.  Although V had wrongly described or failed to identify the hut, this was not fatal to the prosecution’s case, as it was not disputed that they met alone only once that night in only one hut.  I accepted that N did not pay attention to the hut and it was not very bright at the material time (which, according to N, was about 3.00 am). 
70        In my view it was rather telling why N had chosen to speak to V alone, at the hut.  After all, he had been talking to the other post-holders at the circular area, or at the shelter with the blue roof next to the circular area with the tables and benches 
(exhibit D2, photo 4)
, where the scouts were mostly congregated.  Yet he chose to move further away to the hut to speak to V.
71        N’s explanation as to why he had chosen to speak to V and no one else at the hut, was unsatisfactory and unconvincing.  Initially, he evaded the issue by merely saying that it was because he “moved around”.  When asked again, he did not answer the question but merely said that after he had spoken to V at the hut, they went to join the other scouts at the tables and benches.  It was only much later in the cross-examination, that N explained that he was bored sitting at the circular area for over two hours and hence moved to the shelter with the blue roof to speak to the secretary and liaison officers, before proceeding to the hut to speak to V.   I found his explanation to be an afterthought.
72        N then tried to show that it was impossible or most unlikely for him to have taken advantage of V at the hut, without anyone noticing, as there were many members of public and scouts in the vicinity. Again, I rejected his testimony on this.  Although N was very adamant that anyone who had walked past the hut would have seen him fondling V’s penis, if it had happened, I found that this would not be the case unless someone actually looked into the hut and observed what they were doing.  Moreover, their behaviour and outward appearance of sitting in a relaxed manner and having a conversation (whilst N was fondling V’s penis) would not have easily aroused or alerted the suspicions of outsiders to look into the hut.
73        I was highly suspicious, as to how N could recall vividly the number of persons who walked past the hut whilst he was speaking to V for about 30 minutes to an hour.   He claimed that there were three to five couples who walked past the hut, and a group of five or six persons carrying helmets who passed by from behind.  Yet strangely, he could not recall the names of any of the scouts who had walked past.  Initially he stated that there were less than 20 persons who passed by the hut, then said that there were more than 20, then changed his testimony to say that there were more than 30, and finally claimed that there were more than 40 persons.    Moreover, despite being able to recall clearly how many persons walked past the hut, he could not at all recall if any of them actually looked into the hut.
74        Overall, I found this aspect of his testimony to have been concocted.  He had made up the numbers to bolster his defence that it was very crowded near the hut, so that he could not have possibly fondled V’s penis unnoticed.  One of the scouts, L, testified that at around 8.00 or 9.00 pm, the area of the Park where the scouts were gathered was not crowded.  Mr Lim, the teacher in charge, observed at about 11.00 pm that although there were some people at the vicinity of the scouts, they were not surrounded by members of the public.  Moreover it was a very large park.  Hence, at 3.00 am, it would have been far less likely for many members of the public to be gathered near the hut, or near the scouts.   As N admitted, the public would have avoided the scouts and ventured to other parts of the Park.  Even P observed that the public did not venture near the circular area as the scouts were gathered there.  All in all, I was of the view that he had moved to the hut to speak to V and to speak to him alone, to create an opportunity to abuse V, which he ultimately did.

th
 charges – Visits to N’s home in December 2001
75        In December 2001 V started to visit N’s home.  The number of occasions was not really in dispute, as N himself testified that V had visited him on at least two occasions then.  Once again I preferred V’s testimony that he had been molested as he described, on the second and third visits.  N confirmed that he would normally check for e-mails when he arrived home and that it was possible that V and him were on his bed watching television.   I accepted V’s testimony that N had brought V to his room on the second visit, and whilst they were on the bed watching television, N hugged and kissed him, unzipped his shorts and touched his penis.  I also accepted that on the third visit, he hugged and kissed V but did not touch his penis.  Contrary to N’s allegation, I believed that it was possible for him to kiss V on both cheeks whilst V was lying on his side.  As V explained, the right side of his face was not completely pressed against the bed as his head was resting on the pillow and propped up by his shoulder. 
76        Overall, I found V to be a truthful witness who had no reason to lie. He stated that N had touched his penis on the second visit, but admitted candidly that N did not do this on the third occasion but had merely hugged and kissed him.  Although V’s account of the third visit was sketchy, I accepted that this was because he could not recall the details.  Moreover, his testimony on these two charges remained largely consistent even in cross-examination.

th
 charge – Visit to N’s home on 2 February 2002
77        Likewise, I accepted V’s testimony that on this occasion after dinner, N had touched his penis under his underwear, whilst they were both seated on the bed with a blanket covering V’s shorts and N’s hand. V was able to recount what occurred before and after dinner and approximately where he was seated in relation to L when they were playing Playstation.  This was largely corroborated by L.  Although V had initially and mistakenly claimed that this visit was in March, this was not fatal to the prosecution’s case, as it was not in dispute that there was only one occasion in which V and L had gone to N’s home together to play Playstation.
78        Contrary to N’s testimony that the blanket remained folded and tucked under his pillow and bolster all throughout, yet V was able to describe the blanket as soft, quite heavy, flowery and big enough to cover the whole bed.  It was unlikely that V would have noticed or been able to describe in some detail the blanket, which was insignificant to him, if it had remained folded and tucked under the pillow and bolster and had never been lent to anyone (according to N), had it not been used on him.  After all, V’s attention would have been focussed on playing Playstation, and not on a blanket.  The description of the blanket by V was not challenged, and N agreed that the blanket was quite heavy and of a towel-like material, only thicker.  Hence I found that N had indeed used the blanket to cover V, in order to conceal his act of touching V’s penis from sight, especially when L was present.
79        N claimed that apart from tapping V on his shoulder when he first entered the room, he never came into physical contact with V at all when they were on the bed.  This was contrary to L’s testimony, which was not challenged by the defence, that he heard V let out a grunt or made some noise on more than one occasion, and that he saw V’s and N’s bodies in contact and V nudging N away. 
80        Upon further query, N shifted his stand. First he said that whilst on the bed his body was quite close to, but never in contact with the two boys.  He then claimed that his arms might have touched V’s arms, and subsequently admitted that it was possible that V might have nudged him. This was a clear departure from his original testimony, where he was absolutely sure that he had touched V only once when he first entered the room.  I observed that he was reluctant and evasive in answering questions 
(Notes of Evidence pgs 621-626)
.  It was clear to me that N was trying to portray that he was never in physical contact with V (apart from the tap on V’s shoulder), to distance himself from V’s allegation that he had fondled V’s penis.   However his attempt to distance himself from the offence proved futile as L clearly witnessed that N and V were seated next to each other, with their bodies in contact.

th
 charge – N’s visit to V’s home in March 2002
81        I now turn to the occasion of N’s visit to V’s home in March 2002.  Again, I preferred V’s testimony, that it was N who had initiated the visit, offered to bring food for V, and offered to help V with his work.  I believed V that whilst they were in V’s room, N masturbated V until he ejaculated and then gave him a hug and kiss in the hall. 
82        N’s explanation and conduct on how he ended up in V’s home and subsequently V’s room was rather suspicious.  I rejected N’s claim that it was V who had initiated by asking for food whereupon N offered to buy some for him.  I did not believe that V, without any prompting, would have dared to inform his strict and no-nonsense scouts teacher, whom he had a lot of respect for, that he had not eaten lunch when N called him to discuss scouts matters.  This is more so when, according to N, he was already very unhappy with V over the fish tank incident.  When queried further on how V would have raised this issue, N then revealed that it was him who had asked V whether he had eaten and wanted any food, and agreed that it was unlikely that V would have brought up the subject.  Once again, I found N to be evasive and shifty in his testimony. 
83        I also disbelieved N that V had invited him into the room on his own initiative.  I could not see any reason why V would have suddenly invited N into his room without any prompting or for any apparent reason, if not for the fact that N had indeed asked V what he was doing and offered to help with V’s work. 
84        Why would N lie about having invited himself to V’s home and V’s room and attempted to portray that it was V’s initiative or suggestion all the way?  I could not but draw the irresistible inference that N had wanted to visit V that day, with some food, to see if he could take advantage of V.  When he arrived and found that there was no one else at home, he invited himself into V’s room by offering to help V with his work, as an excuse for an opportunity to take advantage of him.    After all, N claimed that he had not even intended to visit V that day, yet he had stayed on for about two hours, and spent the most part of it in V’s room. 
7
th
 charge – N’s visit to V’s home on 19 May 2002, with Australian gifts
85        Similarly, I accepted V’s testimony on what transpired on 19 May 2002, and that N had touched his penis inside his shorts.  Although V had initially stated that N had visited him with gifts in March, nevertheless he corrected the date without prompting and I accepted his explanation that he had been mistaken.  Again this was not fatal to the prosecution’s case, as there was no dispute that N had visited him on only one occasion with gifts from Australia. 
86        Unlike the previous incidents, this one was partly corroborated by Mdm L, who saw N pull his hand out quickly from V’s shorts.  Initially Mdm L testified that it was N’s right hand, contrary to V’s testimony that it was N’s left hand, but subsequently said that she could not recall which hand it was.  Again, I was of the view that this was not fatal to the prosecution’s case, and I accepted Mdm L to be an overall truthful witness who had no reason to lie. 
87        If Mdm L had wanted to help her son by lying, she could have testified that she saw N touching V inside his shorts, before he pulled his hand out, but she did not.  She also honestly and readily admitted that she did not confront N at that time, and maintained a friendly conversation with him after she had witnessed his hand retracting from V’s shorts, because she did not know what N had done by putting his hand in.  Hence, even if she could not recall or had been mistaken as to which hand N had used, nevertheless I believed that she was sure that she had seen N pull a hand out from V’s shorts.  Otherwise, there would have been no reason for her to confront V soon after to ask him if anything had happened.  
88        On the other hand, I found N’s explanation that Mdm L could have been mistaken about her observations, to be untenable.  N described how he had lifted both hands from his lap or seat to his chest area, in the course of turning his whole body to look at Mdm L and greet her when she popped her head into V’s room.  That, N claimed, was how Mdm L had formed a mistaken impression that he had pulled his hand out of V’s shorts.  From N’s demonstration in court, I observed that he was not lifting his hands in a natural way whilst turning his body.   Rather he was flinging his hands quickly and high into the air, in a manner which I found to be rather unnatural and awkward when turning his body to greet someone.  Hence I did not believe N’s explanation, that he had flung both his hands which were placed on his laps or seat, into the air to his chest level, when he turned his whole body to greet Mdm L. 
89        It was also unlikely that N would have needed to turn his entire body to face Mdm L just to greet her, given that he was already seated with the side of his body facing the door.  The natural reaction and tendency would have been to just turn his head towards the door (which was what Mdm L saw), rather than to turn his whole body and swing both arms into the air.   I found that N had made up this reason in a futile attempt to explain away what Mdm L had witnessed.
90        In addition, N’s subsequent explanation for his conduct cast further doubts on his testimony.  He claimed that he knew someone was home the moment Mdm L entered the flat.  Yet he was caught by surprise when she appeared at the doorway of V’s room, because he was expecting to see V’s father instead of Mdm L.  This was different from N’s version put to Mdm L in her cross-examination, namely that N had known of her arrival at the doorway and turned to look at her.  When N was further asked why he was expecting V’s father rather than Mdm L, he gave a totally ridiculous answer, that it was because he had seen V’s father on a previous occasion.  Despite further questioning, N failed to proffer a satisfactory or convincing answer 
(see Notes of Evidence pgs 753-755)
.   I found that N was not surprised by 
who
 had appeared at the doorway, but rather by the fact that 
someone
 had appeared suddenly when he was in the middle of fondling V’s penis.  Hence, he was surprised because he was not aware that someone had returned home and could have caught him in the act.
91        Further I found it very unusual for N to stay with V so long that day, based on the alleged tension in their relationship.  N claimed that he had deliberately avoided V for three weeks before departing for Australia because he was angry with him for failing to perform his scouts’ tasks.  Similarly on 19 May, he was “fuming”, “very angry” with and scolded V when he discovered that V had still failed to carry out his tasks.  Despite being very angry with V for some three weeks before going to Australia and getting mad with him again on 19 May, it was puzzling that he chose to stay with V in his room, after giving him a good scolding.  Strangely, after reprimanding V, he stayed on whilst they just stared sullenly and silently into the computer, ignoring each other!   Although I noted that V had sent out an e-mail on the very same evening to the scouts to remind them to pay their camp fees (
exhibit D6, pg 5
), I did not believe that N had scolded V so badly that day as he claimed.  Indeed, I found that N had made up this incident of scolding V very severely in order to explain the motive for V to frame him.

th
 and 9
th
 charges – Scouts Annual Camp, 24 May 2002
92        Turning then to the last two incidents, I believed V on what had transpired on the night of day zero of the Annual Camp, how he came to be in N’s tent, and the subsequent commission of the offences whilst he was asleep.   Although N may not have slept in the tent with V, this did not preclude the offences from being committed.  N had a 2-men tent, in which V and N could sit side by side.  There was thus enough room for N to be in there with V in order to commit the offences.  I was also satisfied that there was no issue on the identity of the perpetrator.  Although V was asleep, he was semi-conscious and had opened his eyes to see N masturbating him.
93        I found it highly suspicious as to why and how N had to bring V to his tent.  It was not disputed that N had asked V to come out from his patrol tent, led him around the campsite and finally into his own tent.  This was witnessed by K and C.  There was no reason why N had to lead V by his hand or arm, whilst walking around the campsite or why he saw a need to assist V to avoid the materials on the ground.  V could have easily managed, especially since N had described him as an intelligent and matured boy who was old enough to handle matters himself.  I was rather dubious of N’s answer that it was 
natural
 for him to hold 
any
 person’s arm or hand when they were walking together at night and there were obstacles in the way.  It was clear to me that N was holding on to V to lead him into his tent subsequently.
94        According to N, he had intended to speak to V alone on his performance and to impress upon him the importance of this Camp.  It was puzzling why N had to speak to V alone in his tent, when he admitted that he had spoken to some other scouts around the campsite but not alone in the tent.  Further, despite claiming that he had spoken to some of the other weaker scouts, he could not name a single scout whom he had spoken to.  When he realised that he was not very convincing, he changed his testimony and said that V was the only post-holder whom he spoke to alone that night because “he was the weakest”.  When further asked why he did not pull aside the other weaker scouts to inform them of their performance, N claimed that the rest were “pretty okay” and he was not very disappointed with them.  It seemed to me that N was changing his testimony as he went along, to suit his defence and try to explain, albeit unsuccessfully, why V was the only person he had spoken to alone, and in his tent. 
95        From N’s testimony and conduct, I could not but draw the inference that he had never intended to go around the campsite that night to speak to the “weaker” scouts as he claimed.  His alleged purpose for wanting to speak to V alone and leading him into his tent was nothing more than a guise for an opportunity to further exploit V.   Indeed N was initially reluctant to admit that he had led V to his tent (despite holding on to V’s hand or arm), as he first said that they had walked there together, but later admitted that he was the one who had suggested going to his tent.
96        I also did not believe that N had spoken to V “very harshly” and sternly.  I accepted V’s testimony that N did not appear to be very angry with him and that he fell asleep because he was very tired.   Even more puzzling, N did not attempt to wake V up.  After all, N could have easily told V to go back to his patrol tent, which was the most logical and reasonable thing to do, given that V’s tent was just next to N’s.  It was hard to imagine that N was so magnanimous to permit V to sleep in his tent whilst he shared a tent with other scouts, had it not been for some ulterior motive.  
97        Indeed even N’s explanation on how V ended up sleeping in his tent was inconsistent by his own account.  N initially denied that he had informed V, whilst in the tent, that he could sleep there.  However, in his long statement (
exhibit P10, A21
), he said that he had informed V that he could sleep in his tent.  In court, N sought to explain that it was V who had brought up this subject and asked to sleep in N’s tent, whilst they were walking around the campsite.  Yet this was not specifically put to V in cross-examination.  All that defence counsel had put to V, was that whilst in the tent, V felt tired and wanted to sleep there.  When N was asked to clarify this allegation, he denied it.  N then offered a ludicrous explanation that since V felt sleepy and did not ask to leave the tent, he 
presumed
 that V wanted to sleep in his tent!
98        All in all, I was not satisfied with N’s explanation, that V had asked to sleep in N’s tent, or that he had merely assumed that V wanted to do so.  I preferred V’s testimony that he had asked to go back to his own patrol tent but it was N who told him that he could stay in his tent.  It was hard to believe that V would have dared to ask his scouts master whether he could sleep in his tent.
99        I was aware that there were some inconsistencies among the scouts in their account of what transpired the next morning, after V was found in N’s tent.  Likewise there were also discrepancies in the testimonies of what V and Mdm L had informed the school authorities such as Mr Lim.  Nevertheless I was satisfied that they did not materially affect the prosecution’s case.  Although the witnesses’ recollections may have been imperfect, I found that they were truthful and forthright and their testimonies were fairly consistent on the material issues.
Failure to complain and V’s conduct
100      I would now address specifically V’s failure to complain promptly and his conduct in continuing to associate with N despite having been molested on various occasions.  I am reminded by the passage in 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
, at para 29, that:
“.... While it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends, the same cannot be said of a failure to make a prompt police report.  In my experience, there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report.  This stems from a variety of reasons.  The victim may keep silent for fear of being stigmatised or disbelieved.  She may view the police investigation and the court process, both of which are potentially intrusive and distressing, with trepidation, or she may have been so traumatised by the experience that reporting the offence is simply a very low priority.  She may even have been threatened with retaliation if she reported the offence.  Her first recourse will invariably be her family and friends rather than the police.  Indeed, many of those who do eventually make a police report do so only after they have been persuaded to do so by their family or friends....”
101      In addition, the appellate court stated in 
Tang Kin Seng
, at para 79, that:
“The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim’s testimony more credible.  The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim’s evidence 
less
 credible.  The reason is simply common human experience.  It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint.  However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim’s actions depart from it.  It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proffered.  All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.” 
102      As can be seen from the above cases, the failure to make a prompt complaint to the police is not necessarily unusual, as the victim’s first recourse would normally be to a family member or friend.  In addition, the failure to make a prompt complaint does not necessarily render the victim’s testimony less credible in all cases, as there may be very good reasons for not so doing in a particular case.  Hence a fixed formula could not be applied in all situations. 
103      I now turn to the various incidents.  The Pulau Ubin trip was the first such occasion.   As such V would have been caught by surprise and would not know how to react.  I accepted that V, at that age and probably rather naive, had thought that it was nothing more than a friendly gesture, although he felt uneasy.  Moreover, it was not unreasonable for V not to report N then as he was embarrassed, and had a lot of respect for N.  Although V might have looked rather normal and cheerful for the rest of the trip, this did not mean that he was not feeling unhappy or unsettled.  It was ridiculous for defence counsel to suggest that V should have complained during the debriefing at the end of the trip, given that N himself was involved in the debriefing.
104      As for the Pasir Ris Park outing, I accepted that V was afraid to disobey N when he made him lie down, and further did not resist when N fondled his penis as he was too shocked to react. It must be remembered that N was V’s scouts master and V was merely 13 years old.  Hence it was not unusual for him to refrain from complaining, as he did not wish to face up to the shameful incident.
105      I was aware that despite being molested on two previous occasions, V visited N three times thereafter in December 2001, where two other incidents took place.   Although V’s behaviour might have seemed odd to an adult, nevertheless I was satisfied that for V, a 13-year old, his lack of complaint or avoidance of N was not because he had fabricated the prior incidents.  It was not V who had invited himself to or suggested visiting N’s home on these three occasions, contrary to N’s allegation.  I shall return to this point.   In addition, on V’s first visit, N did not take advantage of him.  Hence this might have lulled V into thinking that N would not harm him anymore.
106      It was not unbelievable that V did not yet realise the seriousness and full implications of N’s actions, when N touched his penis on the second visit and hugged and kissed him on the third visit.   I accepted V’s explanation that he did not dare to retaliate against N’s advances as he respected N as his scouts teacher and was afraid that their relationship thereafter might be strained if he did anything to resist.  This was reasonable given that V was faced with his scouts leader, whom he respected a lot and who would have a direct impact on his performance in scouts.   Although V said that he would never go to N’s home again after the third incident (on the second visit), I accepted that V went for the third time because it was N who had brought him there.  Moreover V was not brave enough to decline and did not dare to disobey N whom he regarded as someone with authority over him. 
107      As for the V’s visit to N’s home on 2 February 2002, it was not disputed that N had extended the invitation to the scouts, and it was not V who had suggested visiting N.   In the circumstances it was reasonable for V to assume that since there were many people at N’s home that night, N would not abuse him again, and hence he went.
108      I pause here to look at some cases that dealt with the conduct of the victim after abuse and the failure to complain.  In 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
, the accused, who was the victim’s tuition teacher, was convicted on seven counts of outrage of modesty which occurred on seven different dates.  The victim did not complain for the first five incidents and in fact continued to attend tuition thereafter.    The appellate court accepted that for the first few incidents, the victim did not complain simply because she did not know that the accused had intended to molest her.  Like V, she was only 13 years old then.  The court also accepted that she continued to attend tuition, at the accused’s flat, even after she realised that she was molested five to six times, because she did not think that the accused would repeat his acts again.  In addition, one Madam Teo, who was the accused’s sister and with whom the victim boarded, insisted that she went for tuition.  
109      Whilst the appellate court recognised that there were some weaknesses in the victim’s evidence, nevertheless the court upheld the trial judge’s conclusion that the case had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  This showed that the behaviour of the victim and her failure to complain, in 
Teo Keng
 
Pong
’s case, was not deemed unusual or suspicious enough to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case. 
110      In 
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
, the maid was molested by her employer on three different occasions but she did not complain or raise any alarms until the third offence.  The accused’s conviction was upheld by the Chief Justice who stated, at para 37, that:
“.... While one victim may scream or raise some sort of alarm when she is sexually assaulted, 
it cannot always be assumed that another victim caught in a similar situation would react in the same way
.  The complainant gave evidence that 
her shock and fright had robbed her of her voice
.   As such, the complainant’s reaction was not inherently incredible given that she was 
very traumatised and distressed
....  The district judge also took the view that the complainant’s failure to make a formal complaint to the maid agency or the Indonesian embassy following the first two offences was not suspicious or abnormal because she was 
afraid that the appellant might scold her and that other people ... might not believe her
.  The district judge found her testimony believable, given the complainant’s 
youth and lack of education
....” [emphasis mine]
111      It can be seen from the above cases, that it is fallacious to adhere to a fixed formula in all cases, as stated in 
Tang Kin Seng
.   The appellate court in both 
Teo

 deferred to the trial judges’ assessments as they enjoyed the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and were in a better position to make a more accurate assessment of the veracity of the victims.  
112      In those two cases, the victims’ behaviour subsequent to the incidents were not dissimilar to the present case.   Here, V initially thought that the kissing and hugging were friendly gestures (although he was uncomfortable), and realised that it became more serious when N progressed to fondling his penis.  Nevertheless I accepted that he did not think it was serious enough for him to complain.  This was coupled with the fact that he respected and feared N, who was his scouts master, and did not think that N would continue to molest him.   Being young, he also did not know how to handle the situation and was too embarrassed to inform anyone.  It was also not unusual for him to attempt to block out these unpleasant events from his mind. 
113      Likewise, I found that it was N who had initiated visiting V’s home for Chinese New Year.  Mdm L testified that it was N who had wanted to pay them a visit, to which she agreed.  Contrary to N’s allegation, I did not believe that Mdm L would have been so insistent that N joined them for the reunion dinner.  It was unlikely that Mdm L would have invited him at the very last minute at about 7.00 pm on the night of the reunion dinner, and further insisted that he come, despite N having just finished his own reunion dinner with his family.
114      As for N’s visit to V’s home in March 2002, I accepted that V had agreed to allow N to come because he offered to bring food, and V thought that N was merely coming to pass him the food and leave.  I also accepted that V did not feel uneasy when N entered his home because N had offered to help him with his work.    Likewise I found that V did not stop N from his abusive act because of his position of authority over him.  
115      It was not inconceivable for V to allow N to visit him again in May.  It must be remembered that N did not molest V on each and every occasion that they met.  Indeed during the course of 2001 and 2002, V met N regularly, at weekly and other scouts events.  Moreover, there was a period of about three weeks to a month, prior to 19 May, in which N said that he did not see V.  Hence when N informed V that he would like to pass him some gifts from Australia in May 2002, it was not inconceivable that V did not suspect this to be anything more than an innocent gesture by N.  Although another victim in V’s shoes may have been wary of N’s attempt to be friendly given what had previously occurred, it could not be said that every victim in a similar situation would have reacted in the same manner.   In any event, V did complain to his mother on this occasion, albeit at Mdm L’s prompting.  Nevertheless I did not think that V would have lied to his mother. 
116      However, it was apparent that by the time of the Annual Camp in May 2002, V was already wary of N.  Nevertheless I accepted that when N initially held V’s hand and led him out of his patrol tent, the memories of the previous incidents did not come to mind as N did not lead him towards his own tent and hence V felt more at ease.  Indeed, it was clear from all accounts, that N initially led him in the opposite direction, namely towards K’s tent.   However, when N then led V to his tent, I accepted that V began to feel suspicious, and as he was afraid of being abused again, he told N that he wanted to sleep in his own tent, whereupon N told him that he could stay.  As earlier stated, I found that it was N who had informed V that he could stay, and not that V had asked N’s permission to do so.  
117      I also accepted that when N abused V in the night, V was very frightened and dared not do anything, apart from a cursory and unsuccessful attempt to retract his hand.  V’s fear was not unusual given that the incident was now more serious as N had progressed to using V’s hand to fondle his penis.  I accepted that by this time, V intended to inform his mother as the matter had become very serious and that was all he could bear.   I accepted that V waited until Mdm L came for the barbecue as he did not have his handphone and was under the impression that he was not allowed to communicate with outsiders during the Annual Camp.  The latter was somewhat corroborated by P and C.  
118      In any event, he did inform some of the scouts the next morning, when they asked him what had happened.  In this regard, I rejected N’s allegation that V had made up a story because he was embarrassed at being found in N’s tent.   I also found that it was reasonable for V not to inform his teachers but waited for his mother, as he would feel more comfortable telling his mother than his teacher.
119      In general, N sought to show that as V had undergone a crime prevention course, he would know that what N had done was wrong and should have made an immediate complaint.  I would like to say that knowing and applying knowledge are two different matters.  A victim may know an act to be wrong, but may not necessarily take action immediately or at all.  This was agreed to by A reluctantly.  As N himself admitted, V had a lot of respect for him at the material time when the offences occurred.  Hence he was fearful of and did not have the courage to speak up, which was not surprising given that N was known as a strict scouts leader, as alluded to by the scouts
120      I found that N also knew, having spent much time with V, what sort of person V was and found that V had a docile character and was an easy prey for his acts.   Hence with time, N grew bolder in his advances and used various methods as a pretext or excuse to get close to V in order to take advantage of him, such as inviting V to his home to eat and play, and inviting himself to V’s home by offering to bring food and gifts, and assist V in his work. 
V’s and N’s characters
121      At this juncture, I would like to make a few observations on the characters of V and N.  Most of the scouts testified that V came across as a quiet, shy and reserved person, an introvert who kept mostly to himself.  His mother, who should know him more intimately than the rest, testified that V was a very quiet boy who “dare not to resist”.  Even one of the teachers, Mr Justin found V to be quiet by nature and not gregarious.   Having observed V in the trial for about four days I shared the same views as the majority of the prosecution witnesses.  I found V to be a rather quiet and reserved person, who would generally answer only when spoken to. 
122      This was unlike N, who was described by the scouts as well-respected, strict and a stern disciplinarian; who expected the scouts to perform; did not tolerate tardiness; and would punish a scout for wrongdoing.  Hence it was not unusual for V to remain fearful of N despite N’s constant abuse.  As such I was satisfied with V’s conduct and behaviour, and why he had chosen to remain silent over N’s repeated abuses.   Indeed K observed V to be rather “weak” and a pushover who hardly defended himself from N when N got too close to or tactile with him.   Further, C observed that sometimes V would shy away when N tried to put his arm over his shoulder or hold his hand.  Even N himself admitted that at times V would be uncomfortable when N put his arm around him.
Mdm L’s failure to complain to the police
123      Before leaving the issue of failure to complain, I should deal briefly with Mdm L’s failure to report to the police.  I accepted her explanation as to her delay in taking action.  When V initially complained that N had touched his penis at N’s home, she gave N the benefit of doubt as she thought that he was just playing with V since there was another scout around, and she did not realise the seriousness of the incident then.  When V subsequently informed her of the incident on 19 May 2002 and some other previous incidents, I accepted that she did not wish to report to the police as she did not want to blow the matter up and make things difficult for V, as N was V’s scout master.  In any event, she did advise V to stay away from N where possible.
124      I note also that even after the complaint made at the Annual Camp in May 2002, Mdm L was still reluctant to report to the police, and all she wanted was for N to stop serving in the boys scouts.  I did not see anything unusual with her course of action, as she wanted to protect her son from potential and further embarrassment which may arise as a result of police investigations.  As the Chief Justice explained in 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
, at para 78:
“....In the local context, the failure to make a police report within a reasonable time after the incident is neither here nor there.  I have noted that often, the main reason, amongst others, for not making a police report soon after such an incident is not because the victim has something to hide, rather it is because the victim is afraid of the shame it would bring to the family, should others know about the incident.  
Making a police report and subsequently having the case dealt with by the courts often attracts undue attention which can be very traumatic for the victim as well as for the family
.  Also, some victims may be afraid that their word may not be believed.  Therefore, they would rather suffer in silence than to see that the culprit is punished.  It is for this reason that victims are often reluctant to report any matters to the police.  In view of this therefore, the failure to make an early police report will no longer be seen as fatal to the prosecution’s case, unless it can be ascertained with certainty that this failure was due to other reasons which might cast doubt on the victim’s claim of the offence....”  [emphasis mine].
Other supporting evidence
125      In 
Tang Kin Seng
, the court stated that the right approach was to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and defence, and decide whether the complainant’s evidence was so reliable that a conviction based solely on it was not unsafe.  If it was not, it was necessary to identify which aspect of it was not so convincing and for which supporting evidence was required or desired.  The question then was whether this supporting evidence made up for the weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence.  This ensured that the proper weight was given to the right evidence and no undue weight was assigned to some evidence merely because it was called ‘corroboration’ or ‘supporting evidence’. 
126      In the present case, having observed the demeanour of the witnesses and examined the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the case had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  I was satisfied with V’s explanation on the lack of a prompt complaint and his actions subsequent to the incidents.   Moreover I found other supporting evidence.
127      Mdm L testified that she saw N pulling his hand out of V’s shorts on 19 May 2002.  As stated earlier, I did not find any motive for Mdm L to lie, nor was she mistaken about what she saw.  She had been forthright and honest, and did not go so far as to say that she saw N fondling V inside his shorts.  She also never intended to report to the police or have the accused brought to court.  In addition, L testified that whilst playing Playstation he heard V make some noise and saw him nudge N away.  Likewise Y testified that he saw N push V down on the poncho at Pulau Ubin.  All these were corroborative of the prosecution’s case, and showed that N was trying to disassociate himself from having contact with or touched V in any way at the material time.
The accused’s testimony
128      I now deal with N’s testimony and demeanour.  Overall I found N to be a dishonest and evasive witness.  Other than what I have dealt with, I now turn to some other aspects of his testimony. 
129      For instance, N described V as chatty, talkative, playful and mischievous, and would not allow himself to be bullied and would know how to push N away or reject his advances.  He also said that V was a rather shy person but not timid.  N claimed that V had ever pushed his hand away, such as on an occasion in November or December 2001, as he did not like N to put his hand around him.  If so, it was puzzling that N continued to do this many times thereafter, knowing that V was rather shy and embarrassed when he was seen to be too close to N.  I was dissatisfied with N’s reply, that it was just a friendly gesture.  N then attempted to explain, unconvincingly, that V actually enjoyed what N did when they were alone, but disliked it when they were in the presence of others.  Yet, despite knowing that V disliked what N did in public, it was strange that N chose to continue to put his hand on or around V’s shoulder, without giving thought to V’s feelings or asking V if he minded.   
130      Even stranger, N claimed that although V was uncomfortable with N putting his hand on his shoulder, he was perfectly comfortable with N placing his hand on V’s thigh, in front of other scouts.  When queried further, N claimed that the scouts and he would put their hands on each others’ thighs all the time whenever they were seated on the sofa in the scouts den because the sofa was small and there was no place to put their hands!  When N was told that they could have simply placed their hands on their own thighs, he then claimed that they put their hands on each others’ thighs all the time because they were friends.  I found his testimony highly unbelievable. 
131      It seemed rather strange that among the 
male
 scouts and N, N claimed that they were comfortable putting their hands on each others’ 
thighs
, but not always comfortable putting their hands on each other’s 
shoulder
. It seemed to me that N was merely making this up to show that he was very friendly with the scouts, especially V, and they did not mind when he showed physical affection to them, such as putting his hand on their thighs or shoulders.  As such, I was more inclined to believe K’s and C’s observations that V did not appear comfortable when N got too close to or cosy with him.
132      Overall I found N to be a crafty witness who often back-paddled and vacillated in his testimony.  He confidently claimed that Mdm L was always appraised of his meetings and outings with V, then later admitted that he was not sure and did not know this for a fact.   He claimed that at least one of his family members would be at home on all of V’s visits in December 2001, then said that he was not sure.  At Pulau Ubin, he was sure that V was happier than most of the scouts the day after the alleged abuse, although he admitted that he did not pay any particular attention to V then. 
133      He also claimed that V was the one who generally initiated their social meetings.  For instance, it was V who wanted to go to his home.  Yet when asked further, he evaded the issue, refused to answer and finally admitted that V never expressly mentioned this (
see Notes of Evidence, pgs 605-607
).  He claimed that it was Mdm L who invited him for the Chinese New Year reunion dinner; and that V, had on his own initiative, asked him to buy food in March 2002, invited N to his room during his visits in March and May 2002, and wanted to sleep in his tent at the Annual Camp, all of which I found to be untrue.  Overall N was trying to portray how impossible it was for him to have molested V, since V had initiated all these meetings with him, that Mdm L was always aware of her son’s activities and that there was always someone at N’s home when V visited him.  
Motive for V to lie?
134      A’s unreliability and untruthfulness was further borne out by how he had concocted a story to show that V had fabricated these incidents because he was unhappy with him. However, I found N’s suggestion of a motive on V’s part to falsely implicate him, to be unfounded.  
Suspension of scouts by N
135      N alleged that the scouts were very unhappy with him as he had previously suspended F, V’s patrol-mate, and another scout T.  I found the link between the scouts’ suspensions and the present case to be tenuous.  First, there was no evidence to show that V was close to F, such that his suspension had caused V to make nasty allegations against N.  I believed V that he did not harbour a grudge against N for suspending F because he did not think that N had wrongly or unjustifiably done so.  Second, the suspension took place in July 2001, well before the first molest incident in November 2001.  If V had wanted to fabricate these incidents to take revenge, I did not believe that he would have waited for over a year from F’s suspension before he raised them.  That would have been a very long time to harbour a grudge, especially when F was not V’s close friend.  Third, when N was cross-examined, it transpired that he did not even know if V had made up these allegations because of F’s suspension!  All he could say was, “No one knows what [V’s] mind was at that time”. 
136      As for T, he was not even in the same patrol as V or a close friend, and it was even less likely that V would have harboured a grudge against N for this.  There was also no shred of evidence to show that V and the other scouts had colluded to concoct an allegation against N because of the scouts’ suspension.  
N’s constant unhappiness with V and his reprimands
137      N then surfaced various occasions on which he had reprimanded V for his lack of responsibility and performance, such as his failure to maintain the fish tank.  Strangely enough, he chose to focus and pick on V, as he alleged, and not on the other three scouts, who were equally responsible for the fish tank. 
138      When it was brought to N’s attention that he had sent e-mails addressed to the four scouts collectively 
(exhibit D6, pgs 1-2)
 and there was nothing to indicate that V was the specific target of his unhappiness, N then suddenly claimed that V was the de facto leader of the fish tank group!    Yet the e-mails did not mention V to be the leader, and in fact one of the e-mail replies to N was sent by one Koo on everyone’s behalf, and not by V (who was the supposed leader).   Upon realising this, N then claimed that the group was “headless” at that time, and he made N the de facto leader only subsequently.  Despite this, N admitted that he never informed the rest of the group that he had made V the leader and this allegation that V was the leader was never even put to him.  N then said that since V was the leader, all communications and reprimands were directed to him and not the rest of the group.  Yet N could not produce a shred of evidence on this.
139      As such, I found it hard to believe that N had been targeting V specifically to scold or reprimand him, the alleged reason being that he was the de facto leader, which I also rejected.  I found that N had conjured up this story to buttress his claim that V had a motive to complain against him.
140      I also found N’s allegation of being angry and mad with V for prolonged periods to be inconsistent with his conduct and treatment of V.   N said that he reprimanded V and the other scouts for “murdering and killing” the fish, even as early as January 2002.  Yet, he continued to invite V to his home in February, went to V’s home for Chinese New Year, visited him with food in March, and took him out on various occasions up to early April 2002.   However N then claimed that he started avoiding V for some three weeks from mid April to May 2002, and refused to speak to him, as he was annoyed with V for not performing his duties. 
141      Despite this, he thought of V whilst he was in Australia and bought gifts for him.  Then on 15 May, two days after he returned from Australia, he sent out another stern and “threatening” email 
(exhibit D6, pg 3)
 to the scouts.  It should be noted that this was sent to all the scouts, and was not exclusive to the four scouts who were in charge of maintaining the fish tank, or to V alone.   He explained that this was done because he found out that they had not performed their duties.  If so, I would have thought that N would still be angry with V, because V had apparently failed to perform his duties since January and this remained unchanged.  Yet, he chose to visit V barely four days later and gave him the gifts from Australia.  N explained that no matter how much he scolded the scouts, he did not bear a grudge against them.  If he did not bear a grudge, why did he avoid V for a few weeks before going to Australia?
142      Furthermore N claimed that when he visited V on 19 May and discovered that V had not done his tasks, he was fuming mad, very angry and lectured and scolded V very badly for about 10 minutes. After that, he remained mad at him.  Despite being mad and very angry with V, I could not comprehend why N chose to stay on for another half-hour or more with V in his room, whilst they stared silently into the computer.  N could merely say he did not know why he did that.  
143      Hence, although N may have reprimanded V, I was not convinced that he was so annoyed with and scolded V so badly that V would fabricate these allegations against him.  N’s conduct was incomprehensibly inconsistent with his words, and I found that he had exaggerated and made this up in order to support his claim that V had a motive to fabricate these offences.
144      Likewise I did not believe that N was so unhappy with V on day zero of the Annual Camp in May 2002 to cause V to maliciously frame him the next day.   N did not threaten to sack, suspend or take disciplinary action against V, and he did not even raise his voice at V that night.  There would have been no reason for V to suddenly want to complaint to his mother if that was not the last straw from N after N had gone too far by using V’s hand to touch his penis.   After all, if V had wanted to fix N up, he could have just fabricated 
one
 event or incident pertaining to the night of ground zero, instead of making up another 
seven
 incidents on 
seven
 previous occasions.
145      Overall, it would seem from N’s testimony that he had treated V well all along.  He brought food and gifts, helped him with his work, invited him over to his home on numerous occasions, and brought him for social outings with other scouts.  N claimed that he was like a father and mentor to the scouts, took good care of them, and had a very close-knitted relationship with them.  N also explained that when he scolded V, he would explain to V why he was angry with him, and he had high hopes for V to excel in scouts, and treated him as a good friend.  If so, it was inconceivable that V, who had been treated so well and mentored by N, would suddenly make up an allegation against N, let alone a few allegations!  In fact, V all along testified that he respected N and would still respect him even if he were scolded for doing something wrong.  He would not hate N but might be unhappy with him for a few days only.  If so, I found no reason why V, who was matured and intelligent (as N claimed) would take to heart N’s reprimands and frame him.
N’s impeachment; and overall demeanour of N and V
146      I proceed to deal briefly with the impeachment proceedings.  When the prosecution introduced N’s long statement 
(exhibit P10)
 to impeach his credit, I found that his testimony in court contradicted his long statement on material points. 
147      For instance, N initially denied that, at the Annual Camp, he had informed V, whilst in the tent, that he could sleep there.  However, in his long statement 
(exhibit P10, A21)
, he stated that he had informed V that he could sleep in his tent.  When he sought to clarify the inconsistency, he got himself into a muddle (
see para 96 above
). 
148      Then N claimed, in his statement, that it was possible that he could have given V a peck on his cheek whilst with V on the poncho at Pulau Ubin (
exhibit P10, A 32
), despite denying in court that he had kissed V.   When asked to clarify which version was correct, N then said that he could have 
accidentally
 kissed V.   When I pointed out to him that a kiss could not have been accidental, N agreed, and then claimed that he had previously given a peck on some of the scouts’ cheeks, but strangely he could not recall a single scout’s name.   It was only much further in cross-examination that N named a scout whom he 
might
 have given a peck but nevertheless could not be sure.
149      When asked to clarify again, N then claimed that he was very sure that he did not hug or kiss V at Pulau Ubin.  He then explained why he said he could not recall (
in exhibit P10, A32
), because he thought, at the time he made the long statement, that a kiss included a peck on the cheek.  Then he claimed that he did not give V a kiss but he could not recall if he gave him a peck on the cheek.  He also tried very unconvincingly and absurdly to differentiate a “peck” from a “kiss” by claiming that the former was momentary and not wrongful whilst the latter was!  Unfortunately, this was in direct contradiction to his earlier evidence, that when he made his long statement he assumed that a kiss included a peck on the cheek.  After that he changed his testimony again, and said that it was only in court that he knew that a peck and a kiss were the same thing.  I found N’s testimony to be absolutely ludicrous and preposterous, particularly when he tried to suggest that a peck was alright but a kiss was not, given that he was a lawyer.  When probed further, N finally admitted that both could be wrongful.  
150      N also alleged that during the recording of his statement, the recording officer had been unfair to him as there were questions and answers that were not recorded.  Yet, when asked to illustrate, N could only point to one such alleged instance, namely at 
Q21
 and 
A21
.  Despite this, he did not see fit to amend this portion of his statement although he conceded that the recording officer did not prevent him from making amendments.   Overall, I found that the prosecution had successfully impeached N’s credit.     
151      On the whole, I found N to be a dishonest witness, whose testimony left much to be desired.  He portrayed himself to be the innocent victim, and made V out to be the liar, even crafting an elaborate motive for why V would frame him, which was ultimately proved to be unfounded.  He was clever and cunning in his defence, and could produce emails selectively to suit his case, and even a website - which he only produced at the end of his cross-examination despite having possession of it much earlier.  I gave little weight to this website (
exhibit D10, pgs 35-37
).  The person who put up the website was not known to N, there was no evidence of who had written the comments referring to him, and nothing to show that this person was in any way known to V or that he was even in the scouts.
152      N also portrayed himself to be very sure and confident in his testimony, only to contradict himself with ridiculous and unbelievable explanations.  He subtly but unsuccessfully tried to change his story and position throughout cross-examination when he found himself pinned to the wall.  He had a glib tongue, even to the point of trying to make fine but unpersuasive distinctions between a “kiss” and a “peck”.  Despite being a 36-year old lawyer, and of greater age and maturity than V, he was evasive and unable to give frank and forthright answers. He tried to paint V as someone who was sensitive and did not take to reprimands or harsh words easily.  He claimed that he was much harsher and more unkind to V than to other scouts.  Yet none of the other scouts who were called to testify ever saw N being angry with V, and even V did not think that N had ever been unkind or very angry with him.   
153      Unlike N, I observed V to be a rather quiet and reserved person.  Yet, he was overall forthright and honest and admitted that he could not recall certain events.  He readily admitted that at the Annual Camp in May 2002, N spoke to him about his weaknesses and that he had to be more responsible.  He admitted that he did not do a good job in maintaining the fish tank, had forgotten to send out important e-mails to collect fees for scout activities, and that he had been reprimanded by N.
154      I was aware that there were inconsistencies and flaws in V’s testimony, some of which I had already dealt with.  Suffice it, I do not intend to deal with each and every one of them but just to make some broad observations.  For instance V’s recollection of time and place of some of the incidents were imperfect.  Other inconsistencies included not remembering which hand N had used to fondle V’s penis in some of the charges, on which cheek he was kissed, and whether N had molested him before or after Mdm L came home (the 7
th
 charge). 
155      However, I was of the view that these inconsistencies or failure to recall certain matters did not affect V’s testimony and credibility overall, and was not fatal to the prosecution’s case.  In  
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
, a case of outrage of modesty, the appellate court agreed with the observations by the trial judge, at para 33, that:
“These offences were, after all, committed a year before the trial.  In any event, I should add that it is not uncommon for victims of violent crimes to be incapable of recalling with foolproof accuracy the dates or times of the crimes.  This is particularly so when the victim is young and unsophisticated....” 
156      Likewise, the present offences were committed between one to two years before the trial.  V was a young victim and as there were some eight occasions in which the nine offences were committed, it was not unusual that V would not be able to recall in detail what happened on each and every occasion.  
157      Moreover the appellate court has stated 
that even if a few of these inconsistencies appeared to be material
, a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness – 
Govindaraj Perumalsamy & Ors v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 16
.  Innocent discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies – 
Lewis Christine v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 165
. The trial judge is entitled to determine which part of the witness’s testimony remains credible despite its discrepancies, and there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all – 
Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 205
; 
Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar & Anor v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 344
. 
158      In 
B v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 400
, the appellate court further stated, at para 26, that:
“In determining the reliability of the evidence in question and hence the corresponding weight to be accorded to it, the court should always assess the evidence in the light of all the circumstances of each case as well as the accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense.  Consequently, where the assessment of the overall reliability of the evidence of a child witness is concerned, it is prudent for the court to be mindful that children, depending on their level of intellectual maturity, may occasionally confuse fantasy with reality.”
159      On the whole, I had taken great care to scrutinise V’s and N’s testimonies.  I would like to reiterate that V was a forthright witness who did not hesitate when answering questions and readily admitted when he could not recall or was mistaken.  As such, I was of the view that the discrepancies in his testimony were mainly innocent.  I also took into account that he was only 13 to 14 years old then and that he would not be expected to remember let alone recall each and every detail.  In fact, it was not unusual for abused victims to sometimes block out such unpleasant events so that they can get on with their lives.
160      In 
Teo Keng Pong
, the Chief Justice stated that although there were some weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence, he was of the view that the magistrate was entitled to find that the case had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as the premise behind the appellant’s version, of a misunderstanding blown out of proportion, was so unlikely that the magistrate was entitled to reject it.   Similarly in the present case, I found that N’s version, premised on V begrudging him for being scolded and told that he would not be promoted higher positions, and on his embarrassment at being found in V’s tent by other scouts, to be unlikely.  I would like to add that these were not the only things I considered, but a part of a greater picture of evidence which I had carefully evaluated.
Sentence
161      In sentencing N to 10 months’ imprisonment per charge under s 377A of the Penal Code, and 1 month’s imprisonment per charge under s 354, I took into account the following factors.  It is by now clear that for an offence under s 354, where private parts are intruded upon, the starting point is nine months’ imprisonment with caning - 
Chandresh Patel v PP
 [1995] 1 CLAS News 323; and 
Tok Kok How v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 735
.  The same standard should apply to victims of both genders – 
Lee Kwang Peng v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 278
.  Indeed, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence for s 377A offences, where private parts are intruded upon and there is no consent on the victim’s part, should be similar to those under s 354. 
162      In

[1998] 1 SLR 801
, the accused, a paedophile, pleaded guilty to four charges under s 377, one charge of attempt under s 377 read with s 511, and five charges under s 377A.  He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on each s 377 charge, and one year’s imprisonment on each s 377A charge.  He was ordered to serve a total of 40 years’ imprisonment. 
163      In 
PP v Lim Beng Cheok
 
[2003] SGHC 54
, the accused pleaded guilty to five charges under s 377 and five charges under s 377A of the Penal Code.  The offences under these 10 charges were in respect of five boys aged 13 to 15 at the time of the offences and spanned over a year.  The accused was the victims’ tuition teacher.  Another 46 similar charges were taken into consideration.  The trial judge sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment on each of the s 377A charges and six years’ imprisonment on each of the s 377 charges.  In total he served a term of 18 years’ imprisonment.    No doubt, in that case the accused faced a lot more charges than the present case and there were five victims.  
164      In 
PP v Lee Huan Cheow
 (MA 40/96), the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 377A.  He had among other things, touched and sucked the penis of a young boy in a toilet cubicle.  In sentencing the accused to seven months’ imprisonment, the trial judge was in part guided by the case of 
Abdul Malik bin
 
Othman v PP
 (MA 429/93) which was referred to in 
Ng Huat v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 783
.  In 
Abdul Malik
, the act involved two consenting adults and the appellate court upheld the term of six months’ imprisonment. 
165      Unlike 
Lim Hock Hin
, 
Lim Beng Cheok
 and 
Lee Huan Cheow
, the accused in the present case had claimed trial to the charges.   He had abused the position of trust and authority reposed upon him as a scouts leader, and used that position to prey upon a young boy of 13 to 14 years old.  In 
Lim Hock Hin
, the Court of Appeal stated that where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or victim, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence.
166      In light of the above factors and precedents, I was of the view that a term of 10 months’ imprisonment per s 377A charge was appropriate and not manifestly excessive.  As for the s 354 offences, although the acts of kissing and hugging were relatively minor, nevertheless I was of the view that a custodial term was warranted in view of the aggravating factors of the case.  In particular the abuse that took place at Pulau Ubin was not momentary as N had kissed V for a prolonged period of time.  In totality, I ordered three of the s 377A charges to run consecutively, hence N would serve a term of 30 months’ imprisonment.  
167      Whilst I acknowledge that N had contributed much to the scouts movement in the school, nevertheless there were several aggravating factors which warranted a substantial imprisonment term.   This was not a one-off offence.  The accused, who was in a position of trust, had repeatedly taken advantage of V, a young boy, on eight different occasions.  He had cleverly founds ways and means to create an opportunity to do so, under the guise of wanting to speak to V alone, offering to assist him with his work, and bringing food and gifts to his home.  When he found that V did not resist his previous attempts, he was gradually emboldened to the point that he used V’s hand to touch his own penis (the 9
th
 charge).  Such abuse by an adult in a position of trust against young victims should not be condoned and a general measure of deterrence is warranted.",2004-02-27 00:00:00,SG District Court

Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          The appellant was charged in the High Court as follows:
That you, Ismail Bin Abdul Rahman, on the 7
th
 day of March 2003, sometime between 5.30 am and 6.00 am, at Bukit Panjang Telecoms Exchange, located at 40 Woodlands Road, Singapore, did use an arm, namely, a .38 inch calibre Special Smith & Wesson revolver, by discharging three rounds from the said revolver, with intent to cause physical injury to one Rahim Bin Othman and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 4(1) of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.
Rahim bin Othman (“the deceased”) subsequently died in hospital. The appellant, at trial, did not dispute that he had discharged the three rounds from the said revolver but claimed that he had done so unintentionally. He was convicted and sentenced to death.
2          He appealed against his conviction and sentence. We heard his appeal and dismissed it for the reasons we now give.
Facts
3          The uncontested facts are these. The appellant and the deceased were former colleagues. The deceased, an officer with the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (“CISCO”), was on overnight duty at Bukit Panjang Telecoms Exchange (“the Exchange”) from approximately 9.15pm on 6 March 2003. He had been issued a .38 calibre Special Smith and Wesson revolver (“the revolver”) and ten rounds of ammunition. The appellant was a former CISCO officer, known to the deceased and some others by his nickname “Mail”, who was working as a commercial diver in Indonesia. (The appellant had been absent without leave from his CISCO duties. Disciplinary action was taken against him, and his full-time employment with CISCO came to an end at the end of December 2002.)
4          On 6 March 2003, at approximately 11.20pm, the appellant went to the Exchange after returning to Singapore from Batam at about 9.30pm. The appellant testified that the deceased let him into the guardhouse and made him a drink. There was no one else there. They engaged in casual conversation and the topic of discussion soon came around to marksmanship. Sometime past 11.20pm, the deceased handed the revolver to the appellant and asked him to demonstrate shooting techniques, knowing that the appellant had been classified as a “marksman” during his time at CISCO. At around 2.30am on 7 March 2003, the deceased took back his revolver and went on his patrol duties; the appellant waited in the guardhouse. The deceased returned and they continued talking. According to the appellant, the deceased gave the revolver to him a second time at approximately 5.30am and asked him to demonstrate some shooting techniques again.
5          The appellant then caused three live rounds to be discharged from the revolver into the deceased. The appellant, thinking that his former colleague was dead, took the deceased’s revolver and bullet pouch of five rounds, an ash tray, a glass cup, all the closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) video tapes at the Exchange, $7 from the deceased’s wallet, and left for home. At his flat in Bukit Batok, the appellant placed the CCTV videotapes in the storeroom, kept the revolver and the bullets in a drawer in the master bedroom, and threw the ashtray and the cup into the rubbish chute.
6          The appellant went to the Hong Kah North Neighbourhood Police Post (“the NPP”) at about 9.15am on 7 March 2003. A team of Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) officers, who had been tailing the appellant, entered the NPP soon after and arrested him.
7          The officer-in-charge of the CID team, Assistant Superintendent Abdul Halim bin Osman (“ASP Halim”), proceeded to interview the appellant. The appellant professed that the shooting was accidental and wrote a statement to that effect (“the self-written statement”). The Prosecution did not use this statement at trial.
8          In the course of police investigations, the appellant made four further statements (“the four statements”), which were in the nature of confessions to the investigating officer (“IO”), Inspector Roy Lim (“Insp Lim”):
(a)        on 7 March 2003 at about 11.00am at the Bukit Batok bus interchange (“the first statement”);
(b)        on 9 March 2003 at about 6.20pm at the CID (“the second statement”);
(c)        on 13 March 2003 at about 2.30pm at the CID (“the third statement”); and
(d)        on 20 March 2003 at about 3.55pm at the CID (“the fourth statement”).
We will deal with the circumstances relating to the taking of the four statements in greater detail below.
The Prosecution’s case
9          The contents of the four statements formed the backbone of the Prosecution’s case. In those statements, the appellant had stated that he had gone to the Exchange on 6 March 2003 with the intention to “get” a gun, and he knew that there would only be one CISCO guard stationed there. He had a “money problem” and needed the revolver to carry out his plan to rob the DBS bank at Bukit Batok Central. When the deceased handed the revolver (which was loaded with live rounds) to him at about 5.30am on 7 March 2003, he had fired two shots into the deceased’s left side in order to “get hold of the revolver”. The appellant knew that the revolver was loaded with live rounds, and that firing live rounds at someone could be fatal. The deceased thought that there had been a misfire and told the appellant that both of them should explain this to CISCO. The deceased had then wanted to use the telephone to inform his family and the ambulance services that he had been shot. The appellant, to prevent his plan from being foiled, fired a third shot into the deceased’s stomach.
10        The four statements were clearly in the nature of confessions. A confession, according to s 17(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”) is “an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence”. The test of whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, 
ie
 whether a reasonable person reading the statement would conclude that the appellant had committed the offence charged: 
Anandagoda v The Queen
 [1962] 1 MLJ 289, 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
, 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
. The following excerpts from the appellant’s third statement illustrate this very clearly:
His left side of the body was facing me. My main target was to get hold of the revolver. So when he was not aware, I fired the revolver two times at the left side of his body.
He then asked me to pass the phone to him to call his wife and ambulance. I could not let him call because it would spoil my second plan. So I estimated at about 5.45am, I shot him one more time around the front part of his stomach … I thought that he was dead.
We now turn to the rest of the evidence presented by the Prosecution.
11        At about 6.00am on 27 March 2003, the deceased’s superior, Sergeant Chandrasaharan, had received a call from the deceased. The deceased informed Sgt Chandrasaharan that he had been shot by “Mail”. The deceased’s family received a similar call from him. When the deceased’s 19-year-old son spoke to him, the deceased sounded breathless and kept uttering some prayers. The police and the ambulance services were informed. Sgt Chandrasaharan went to the Exchange immediately and found the electronically controlled main gate opened. The deceased was in a supine position on the floor in the guardhouse, and he told Sgt Chandrasaharan that the appellant had shot him and then run away with the revolver.
12        Shortly thereafter, police officers arrived at the Exchange. Sgt Chandrasaharan related to them what the deceased had told him, and described the appellant to them as a male Malay in his thirties who was bald and had a stout build. This information was relayed to the Police Division Operations Room.
13        An ambulance arrived and the attending paramedic found three gunshot wounds at the front of the deceased’s body and an exit wound at his rear right waist area. The deceased went into cardiac arrest during emergency surgery and passed away at the hospital. The autopsy report stated that the certified cause of death was the multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. It also stated that there were three separate gunshot wounds, and that three slugs were recovered from the deceased’s body. According to the autopsy report, each gunshot wound was sufficient by itself to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.
14        The appellant’s wife testified that the appellant had returned to their Bukit Batok flat on 7 March 2003 at about 6.30am. He was perspiring. After sending their youngest son off to school, he sat in the kitchen, smoked a cigarette and ate his breakfast. He appeared to his wife to be disturbed about something. He told his wife he had gone to Batam the previous night and had arrived back in Singapore at about 1.00am on 7 March 2003. He then went to lie down on their bed. At about 8.15am, he left the flat with a white helmet and helmet bag. The appellant’s wife added that they did not have any financial problems during the earlier years of their marriage. From the middle of 2002, however, the appellant had incurred credit card debts and was facing financial difficulties.
15        ASP Halim testified that at about 8.50am on 7 March 2003, he received information that the appellant had been spotted at Bukit Batok Central. He and his team of officers arrived in the vicinity, and saw the appellant leaving the men’s toilet at the Bukit Batok bus interchange. They tailed him. The appellant took a bus to Bukit Gombak and walked towards the NPP. Sergeant Lim Tong Harn (“Sgt Lim”), who was on duty at the NPP, testified that the appellant walked into the NPP at about 9.15am, perspiring and panting. He had paced about carrying a bag, and looked out of the glass door anxiously. He told Sgt Lim that he was being chased. Sgt Lim then realised that the appellant fit the description of the person wanted in connection with the shooting. The appellant asked Sgt Lim for permission to use the telephone and made a phone call to his wife. He then told Sgt Lim, “I confessed to what happened earlier at Panjang. Here are all the things”, and surrendered the bag containing the revolver, seven rounds of ammunition and three cartridges. ASP Halim and his team of CID officers entered the NPP at that point and arrested him.
16        ASP Halim proceeded to interview the appellant at the NPP, and the self-written statement was taken. When the IO arrived, the appellant was brought to the men’s toilet at the Bukit Batok bus interchange and the first statement was taken. At about 12.15pm, the police officers brought the appellant to his flat, where the CCTV videotapes were found. The cup and the ashtray were recovered from the rubbish chute.
17        Dr Tay Ming Kiong, an analyst with the Centre for Forensic Science, Health Sciences Authority, examined the clothes worn by the appellant and the deceased at the time of the shooting incident and found gunshot residue on them. His finding meant that the clothes examined were within one or two metres of the firearm at the time of discharge or were in close contact with things with gunshot residue particles.
18        Another analyst, Vicky Chow Yuen San, found that the gunpowder patterns around the holes in the deceased’s shirt were consistent with those of shots fired from less than a distance of one metre. She was of the opinion that the slugs and the cartridges were fired from the revolver in question.
19        Sergeant Kwek Tze Wei (“Sgt Kwek”) of the Armament and Operations Equipment Division, Police Logistics Department, examined the revolver and found that it was in a fully serviceable condition. In particular, there was nothing faulty with its trigger and its safety mechanism. Importantly (and this will be seen), Sgt Kwek highlighted to the court that a finger pressure of 5.91kg was required to pull the trigger at “double action” while 1.38kg of finger pressure was required at “single action”, where the hammer of the revolver was at a fully cocked position.
20        Dr Tommy Tan (“Dr Tan”), a consultant with the Institute of Mental Health at Woodbridge Hospital, examined the appellant and was of the opinion that the appellant had been suffering from a prolonged depressive reaction for at least a few months. This condition was characterised by a low mood, decreased appetite and poor sleep, and Dr Tan stated in his report that this was caused by the appellant’s financial difficulties. (The appellant had told Dr Tan that he was in debt, to the extent of more than $140,000, to credit card companies and other persons. He had also told Dr Tan that he had been robbed of $35,000 while he was in Batam.) However, Dr Tan also reported that the appellant was not of unsound mind at the time of the shooting incident, as he was aware of what he was doing and that what he did was wrong. His mental state, according to Dr Tan, did not substantially diminish his mental responsibility for the shooting as he had planned it and was fully aware of the consequences if he was arrested.
21        As such, the Prosecution contended that the appellant was liable under s 4 of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Section 4 of the Act provides:
(1)        Subject to any exception referred to in Chapter IV of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) which may be applicable (other than section 95), any person who uses or attempts to use any arm shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be punished with death.
(2)        In any proceedings for an offence under this section, any person who uses or attempts to use any arm shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have used or attempted to use the arm with the intention to cause physical injury to any person or property.
22        Upon hearing the Prosecution’s evidence, the trial judge found that a case had been made out against the appellant that would warrant his conviction if not rebutted. As such, he called upon the Defence to present its case.
The Defence’s case
23        The appellant challenged the voluntariness of the four statements at trial. He claimed that the version of events furnished in the four statements was a result of inducements, threats and promises made by the investigating officers during the course of investigations and the statements were thereby inadmissible by virtue of s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).
24        The appellant’s version of events was as follows. He had discharged the three rounds unintentionally. He had not gone to the Exchange with the intention to get a gun, but rather, to borrow money from the deceased to alleviate his “money problem”. He had stood the deceased up at an earlier appointment in the afternoon of 6 March 2003, when the deceased was supposed to have lent him $2,000. Knowing that the deceased was on duty at the Exchange, he went there immediately upon arriving in Singapore from Batam that evening without informing the deceased beforehand. The deceased let him into the guardhouse but did not have the cash on him. The appellant, however, remained in the guardhouse as the deceased agreed to withdraw the money for him the next morning. The deceased made the appellant a drink and they soon starting chatting, among other things, about shooting and marksmanship.
25        The appellant claimed that the revolver was not loaded the first time he demonstrated shooting techniques to the deceased: the cylinder of the revolver was opened with no bullets inside its chambers and they both clicked on the trigger many times without harm. The appellant asserted, as such, that he was unaware that the revolver was loaded the second time the deceased handed it to him. He did not check to see if the deceased had loaded the revolver when the deceased went on his patrol duties. The appellant took the revolver and pulled the trigger twice in quick succession to demonstrate the “double-clicking” shooting technique to the deceased. This resulted in the first two shots being discharged, both of which hit the deceased. The deceased exclaimed, “Mail, short circuit”, and tried to stand up when another shot hit him. This third round was supposedly discharged unintentionally when the appellant somehow accidentally pulled the trigger a third time.
The decision below
26        The trial judge rightly held a trial within a trial to determine the voluntariness of the four statements made by the appellant. He found that the Prosecution had discharged its duty to prove beyond reasonable doubt that all the statements of the appellant were made voluntarily and duly admitted them into evidence.
27        He proceeded to hold that the true version of events was contained in the four statements from the appellant and not in his oral testimony in court. To him, the facts of the case showed clearly that the appellant had fired the first two shots at the deceased with the intent to cause physical injury at the very least. The third shot was undoubtedly fired not only to cause physical injury but death as well. He therefore had no doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence as charged and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty contained in s 4(1) of the Act.
The appeal
28        The appellant raised three questions in his petition of appeal for our determination:
(a)        Were the four statements voluntary and rightly admitted into evidence?
(b)        Did the trial judge rightly prefer the Prosecution’s version of events?
(c)        Did the appellant intend to cause physical injury to the deceased by the shooting?
Before us, counsel for the appellant conceded that his client had a challenging case because much of the learned judge’s decision was based on findings of fact. As such, he did not belabour us with lengthy oral submissions. Nevertheless, the severity of the sentence called for our close attention, and we now address each of the appellant’s three questions in turn.
Voluntariness of the appellant’s four statements
29        The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in admitting the four statements, giving undue weight to the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses.
30        The admissibility of statements made to police officers (under ss 121 and 122(6) of the CPC) is governed by s 122(5) of the CPC. This is in identical terms to the test of voluntariness for confessions in general enunciated by s 24 of the EA. The case law on both provisions that we have referred to is, as such, of relevance. Section 122(5) of the CPC provides:
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:
Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
We now turn to the four statements and the alleged circumstances in which they were taken in greater detail.
31        On 7 March 2003, after the appellant had completed the self-written statement at the NPP, the CID officers brought him to the Bukit Batok bus interchange where he had been spotted earlier. The appellant alleged that while he was in the vehicle headed for the bus interchange, Assistant Superintendent Ng Poh Lai (“ASP Ng”) told him not to tell lies as the government had spent thousands of dollars to send him (ASP Ng) for courses and that he was able to determine if a person was lying. In the men’s toilet at the bus interchange, the appellant alleged that ASP Ng kept asking him to tell the truth even though the appellant had told him it was a misfire. The appellant claimed that he felt disappointed and hopeless since nobody believed him. As a result, he made up the first statement to the IO and put his signature to it. Later that day, the appellant was informed that the deceased had passed away and that he would be facing a murder charge.
32        On 9 March 2003, the IO, Insp Lim, brought the appellant out of the lockup. The appellant alleged that Insp Lim asked him to co-operate with him and to tell the truth. Insp Lim told the appellant that if he co-operated and told him everything, he would speak to the judge and try to get a lesser sentence for the appellant. The appellant claimed that since his self-written statement was not believed he had no choice but to make up a story based on the promise made by Insp Lim. This “made-up story” is the version of events contained in the second, third and fourth statements that we have summarised above.
33        It is the Prosecution’s duty to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statements made by the appellant were voluntary: 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
, 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 ([10], 
supra
). It does so by removing reasonable doubt of the existence of the inducement, threat or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
. Corollary to this duty is the responsibility on the part of the Prosecution to ensure that the persons who the appellant claimed induced or threatened him are available as witnesses at the 
voir dire
 to show these contentions to be untrue: 
PP v Kadir bin Awang
 
[1989] SLR 214
. For instance, the police officer who interrogated the appellant would have to give a detailed account of how the interrogation was conducted, including the times of interrogation, the length or the periods of interrogation and how the accused was treated: 
PP v Lim Kian Tat
 
[1990] SLR 364
. We were fully satisfied that these requirements were fulfilled at the trial below, and that no discrepancies arose from the testimonies of the police officers in charge of the investigation.
34        At the trial within the trial, the Prosecution’s witnesses, including ASP Ng and Insp Lim, consistently maintained that none of the alleged utterances were ever made to the appellant during the course of police investigations; the appellant had been fully co-operative with the police throughout. The trial judge accepted that the Prosecution had discharged its burden and held that there were no such threats or inducements as alleged by the appellant. This was a finding of fact based on an assessment of witnesses’ credibility which we would not disturb unless convinced that such findings were clearly against the weight of evidence: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
, 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
. There was nothing that led us to doubt the veracity of the Prosecution’s witnesses. The appellant did not discharge the burden upon him to show that the trial judge’s assessment of credibility and veracity was plainly wrong: 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
. As such, we were of the view that none of the alleged inducements, threats or promises were ever made.
35        It was therefore patently clear to us that there was no basis for the appellant to challenge the admissibility of the statements pursuant to s 122(5) of the CPC since nothing in the nature of “any inducement, threat or promise” was ever made to him. The statements could not, as such, have been made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise. Any purported inducement, if at all, would have been self-perceived by the appellant, which cannot in law affect the admissibility of a statement: 
Lu Lai Heng v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 251
, 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
.
36        Even if the alleged utterances were made (and we were of the view that they were not), the four statements would not have been rendered inadmissible as a result. The test of voluntariness was articulated clearly by this court in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 at [45]:
The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge …
37        We considered the appellant’s allegation that ASP Ng had told him not to tell lies as the government had trained him to determine if a person was lying. We also bore in mind the appellant’s allegation that Insp Lim had told the appellant to co-operate with him and to tell the truth, and that if the appellant did so by disclosing everything, Insp Lim would speak to the judge and try to get the appellant a lesser sentence. Whether or not a particular statement imports an inducement, threat or promise should be approached in a common-sense way and in the context of the individual case: 
Osman bin Din v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 129
. In 
Osman bin Din
, this court held that it was necessary for the appellant to have reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the contested statements. On the particular facts of 
Osman bin Din
, this court held that there were no such reasonable grounds. The objective part of the voluntariness test was not satisfied and there was therefore no necessity to move on to consider the subjective limb of the test. If the objective limb was satisfied, then the question would have been whether the accused had indeed made the statement as a result of the inducement, threat or promise. Thus, if the accused knew that the inducement, threat or promise was an empty one that could not be carried out, but nevertheless made his statement, the statement would have been voluntary.
38        In 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
, the appellant was charged for the possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed). This court found that the police officer made a representation to the appellant that he would not face the death penalty since the appellant’s key could not open the door to the flat where the drugs in question were found and as such, he should give a “good” statement and leave it to the investigating officer who would make out the appropriate charge. This court went on to find that such a statement plainly was an inducement calculated to influence the appellant’s mind with respect to his “escape from the charge” brought against him. The appellant’s confession was therefore inadmissible pursuant to s 24 of the EA. In 
Sharom bin Ahmad v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 565
, this court considered 
Poh Kay Keong
 and concluded that a promise to procure a reduced charge (from a person in authority) would amount to an obvious inducement to give an inculpatory statement in exchange for a non-capital charge. This is, of course, subject to the second limb of the voluntariness test mentioned above.
39        On the other hand, it is now the law that words to the effect of “you had better tell the truth” or their equivalent do not automatically constitute an inducement, threat or promise vitiating voluntariness: 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
. It is clear to us that a police officer can legitimately remind a witness that he should tell the truth and not tell lies: 
PP v Ramasamy a/l Sebastian
 
[1990] SLR 875
, 
Tang Tuck Wah v PP
 
[1990] SLR 412
. Indeed, it is a function of police investigations to ascertain the truth of the matter. An exhortation to tell the truth cannot, objectively or immediately, be taken as an inducement, threat or promise to make a statement relevant or relating to the charge in question in order to gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature. The entire circumstances must be examined.
40        In the instant case, words to the effect that the appellant should tell the truth (or not to tell lies) were coupled with the representations that first, the appellant would not be able to tell a lie without detection in any case because of the officer’s training and second, that the officer would speak to the judge and try to get the appellant a lighter sentence if he did. We were of the view that, taken in their alleged context, these words were wholly different from the representation made in 
Poh Kay Keong
 to the appellant that a lighter charge would be procured (from one which carried the death penalty) if he made a “good” statement.
41        We felt that the trial judge was correct to hold that:
Even if the alleged words had been uttered by ASP Ng or anyone else, I did not think that the accused would have abandoned hope and his senses so completely that he would concoct a story for the investigating officer. It was not his case that the so-called story was suggested to him by any of the officers or that they told him what they wanted to hear from him.
In 
Sim Cheng Yong v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 722
, it was held that merely stating that the accused would be assisted if he co-operated, without more, was not sufficient to satisfy the conditions of the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC. In this vein, the difference between the alleged inducements in 
Poh Kay Keong
 and the present case was the degree of assurance (discernible to the reasonable man) allegedly given to the respective appellants by the police officer involved. In 
Poh Kay Keong
 the appellant was told that he 
would not hang
, whereas here the appellant was told that the officer would 
try to get the appellant a lighter sentence
. As such, we would apply the approach of the Court of Appeal in 
Osman bin Din
 and hold that the appellant would have had no reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the four statements, failing on the objective limb of the voluntariness test. Thus, whether the appellant had subjectively thought that an advantage would have resulted from telling the “truth” did not arise.
The Prosecution’s version of events
42        The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant’s version of the shooting incident was “totally illogical and incredible”. We were unable to agree with this contention.
43        It is a trite proposition of law that where the trial judge had to decide which among different versions of events was true, and his findings were not clearly against the weight of evidence, this court will not interfere with his determination: 
Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 87
. In 
Chua Yong Khiang Melvin
 at [31], I stated that:
There is a sound rationale for this. The trial judge enjoys the advantage of observing the demeanours of the witnesses. In deciding who to believe, he takes into consideration all relevant factors involved, with the advantage of his observations.
44        We noted the following features of the appellant’s version of events at trial:
(a)        The appellant had gone to the Exchange immediately after arriving in Singapore from Batam with the hope of borrowing some money from the deceased.
(b)        The deceased handed the revolver to the appellant with the cylinder opened and with no bullets inside the chambers in order for the appellant to demonstrate shooting techniques on the first occasion.
(c)        The deceased went on his patrol duties at approximately 2.30am with the revolver. The appellant did not see the deceased loading the weapon at any time.
(d)        The deceased handed the revolver to the appellant again at about 5.30am for the same reason as before, this time with the cylinder closed. The appellant pointed the revolver at the deceased and pulled the trigger twice, thinking that it was not loaded. It was loaded, and two rounds hit the deceased.
(e)        Somehow, the appellant accidentally pulled the trigger a third time and another shot hit the deceased.
(f)         The appellant realised that he had misfired and helped the deceased to the ground. He helped the deceased to remove his shoes and turned to see that the deceased had reloaded the revolver. The appellant then went to get some water for the deceased and returned to find him motionless.
(g)        Thinking the deceased had died, the appellant took
 
the deceased’s bullet pouch of five rounds, the revolver,
 
a cup, the ashtray and the CCTV videotapes. The appellant testified that he had taken the revolver for “safety reason” and the other items “not for a purpose”. He “just took whatever were in front of [him], during that moment of pressed and under tension”. He also took $7 from the deceased’s wallet for the taxi fare home.
(h)        The appellant then left for home in a confused state of mind with all those items. At his flat in Bukit Batok, the appellant placed the CCTV videotapes in the storeroom and kept the revolver and the bullets in a drawer in the master bedroom. His intention at that time was to return the revolver. He also threw the ashtray and the cup into the rubbish chute without knowing why.
45        It was evident to us that there were many inherent improbabilities in the appellant’s version of events such that the trial judge was fully entitled to find it “totally illogical and incredible”. We were of one mind with him in his evaluation of the appellant’s version. The trial judge had highlighted these improbabilities in the appellant’s version in his grounds of decision, and they were as follows:
(a)        The deceased was on official duty at a guard post and the revolver could not have been unloaded to begin with. The appellant himself had testified that, according to CISCO procedures, the “loading and unloading of bullets must be done at the CISCO station” prior to the assumption of guard duty.
(b)        If the deceased later decided to load the weapon, as the appellant claimed he did, he would surely have informed the appellant about it when handing it to him. He would not have allowed the appellant to handle a loaded weapon in the knowledge that the appellant was going to demonstrate shooting techniques by pulling the trigger.
(c)        The appellant had been a CISCO officer for about ten years and was a marksman adept at handling revolvers. He would have immediately realised that two live rounds had been discharged from the revolver from the noise and the resultant recoil even if he genuinely thought that it was unloaded when squeezing the trigger the first two times.
(d)        A normal reaction thereafter would have been to drop the revolver in shock. Instead the appellant had held onto the revolver firmly and pulled the trigger a third time. The appellant, significantly, had never misfired a revolver once during his ten years in CISCO.
(e)        The appellant’s evidence about wanting a loan from the deceased was mentioned for the first time during his testimony in court. The trial judge held that this was concocted to give the impression that the appellant had a legitimate reason for visiting the deceased so late at night immediately after returning from Batam.
(f)         The appellant’s story about the deceased having reloaded the revolver was bizarre. The deceased would have been unable to do so after being shot thrice.
(g)        The appellant claimed that he was confused after the “accidental” shooting but was able to remove all the things that he thought could have pointed to his presence at the Exchange in a cool-headed and calculated way.
(h)        If the shooting was in fact an accident, the appellant would have sought medical attention for the deceased immediately. If he believed that the deceased had died, he would still have called for the police since a firearm and live bullets were involved. However, neither course of action occurred to him “at all” and he took the dying man’s money for his taxi fare home instead.
(i)         At home, he behaved as if nothing had happened and had the presence of mind to keep the CCTV videotapes in the storeroom and to get rid of the cup and the ashtray.
46        We did not hesitate affirming the trial judge’s preference for the Prosecution’s version of events to that of the appellant’s at trial. The Prosecution’s version was gleaned from the four voluntary confessional statements made by the appellant, and the trial judge had rightly adverted to a sense of detail, coherence and consistency in the four statements unlikely to be present in a fictitious version of events. We now turn to deal with the last question on the appellant’s intention to cause physical injury in the context of s 4 of the Act.
Intention to cause physical injury
47        In preferring the Prosecution’s version of events, the trial judge had rejected the appellant’s assertion that he had fired the three shots without the intention to cause the deceased any physical injury. The appellant’s contention in relation to the first two shots was that he had not known that the revolver was loaded when he pulled the trigger. In relation to the third shot, he claimed that he had misfired the gun accidentally. The trial judge rejected these contentions and held that:
The facts of this case did not even require the application of the presumption in section 4(2) of the Arms Offences Act. The facts showed clearly that the accused fired the first two shots at Rahim with intent to cause physical injury to him at the very least. The third shot was undoubtedly fired not only to cause physical injury but death as well.
48        In this, we felt that the trial judge had adopted an incorrect method of analysis of the operation of the presumption of intention to cause physical injury under s 4(2) of the Act. Section 4(1) of the Act provides that any person who uses or attempts to use any arm (including a firearm such as the revolver) “shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be punished with death”. The definition of “use” includes an “intent to cause physical injury to any person” under s 2 of the Act. Section 4(2) of the Act provides that any person who uses or attempts to use any arm is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have intended to cause physical injury to a person or to property.
49        The trial judge, in stating that the facts of the present case did not even 
require
 the application of the presumption, presupposed that he could choose whether or not to apply the presumption in s 4(2) of the Act. It was our understanding of the 1993 amendment to the Act (introducing the section) that the presumption was meant to be 
automatic
 and comes into operation the moment a person uses or attempts to use any arm. It was apparent to us that the parliamentary intention underlying the amendment was that punishment for such offences should not be made dependent on an accused’s state of mind due to the extreme gravity of arms offences. The Minister, during the relevant parliamentary debates, had recognised that this presumption “almost brings the law to that of strict liability”, but he made “no apologies for it”.
50        It was therefore important to recognise the precise manner of operation of the presumption even though the trial judge had ultimately found the existence of an intention to cause physical injury on the part of the appellant. The correct approach was adopted by this court in 
Tay Chin Wah v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 27
, where the presumption in s 4(2) of the Act was held to be 
reinforced
 by the evidence before the court rather than 
not
 
applied
.
51        It was noteworthy that the operation of s 4 of the Act is subject to the general exceptions contained in Chapter IV of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). This includes s 80 of the PC, which provides that nothing is an offence that is done by accident 
in the doing of a lawful act
. If made out, the defence of accident would have provided the appellant with a complete defence. This defence was however not available to the appellant since he did not possess a valid licence for the revolver at the material time and instantly failed the “lawful act” requirement. We felt that the distinction between the appellant’s assertion that he fired the revolver “accidentally” and the 
general defence
 of accident was not fully appreciated by the trial judge below. The appellant’s assertion was to the effect that he did not intend to cause physical injury to the deceased when he discharged the live rounds from the revolver. The trial judge, however, thought that the appellant was attempting to rely on the general defence of accident.
52        In order to succeed on the third limb of the appeal and rebut the presumption in s 4(2) of the Act, the appellant had the burden to produce sufficient evidence to prove that he discharged the three rounds from the revolver 
without
 the intention to cause physical injury to the deceased: 
Tay Chin Wah
. It was not for the Prosecution to prove that the appellant had intended to cause physical injury to the deceased.
53        In 
Tay Chin Wah
, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant’s bare denial of possessing the requisite intention was far from sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption in s 4(2) of the Act. Indeed, the evidence before the court in 
Tay Chin Wah
 reinforced the presumption that the appellant had intended to cause physical injury to the victims. We would say the same for the present appeal. The evidence pointed clearly to the appellant’s knowledge that the revolver was loaded. He had been a CISCO guard for ten years and was a marksman. He was fully conversant with the safety regulations and was likely to have checked whether the revolver was loaded when he took it from the deceased. Indeed, at trial, the appellant was able to tell just from looking at a photograph of the revolver whether it was loaded. To us, his explanation that the lighting was poor and that he was sleepy at the time rang hollow in light of the fact that he was alert enough to demonstrate shooting techniques to the deceased. It was in the evidence that whenever the revolver was fired, it would recoil upward and backward by approximately 10cm. Even if the appellant had unintentionally fired the first round from the revolver, the resultant recoil and sound from firing the first shot would have alerted him to the fact that a live round had been fired.
54        The triggering mechanism for the discharge of a round from the revolver also pointed to the appellant’s culpability. Rounds are fired from the revolver by “single action” or “double action”. “Single action” firing involves cocking the hammer 
before
 pulling the trigger to discharge one round. “Double action” firing does not involve cocking the hammer of the revolver, and it is “to pull the trigger backwards until the end of the action”, upon which the mechanism will disengage and the hammer will throw itself forward in order to discharge a round. (It was not possible for two bullets to be discharged, one after the other, with a single pull of the trigger as the revolver was not an automatic or semi-automatic weapon.) Double action firing requires a great deal more force than single action firing. The exact finger pressure, as we mentioned earlier, required on the trigger of the revolver for double action firing is 5.91kg and 1.38kg for single action firing. The appellant testified that he had not cocked the hammer of the revolver for all three rounds discharged. On this testimony, double action firing would therefore have been required and the corresponding amount of finger pressure reinforced our conclusion that it was highly unlikely that any round was accidentally discharged at all. It struck us with particular force, considering all these, that the appellant had never misfired a single round during his decade of service with CISCO and that he was fully aware that firing live rounds from a revolver at a person could have fatal consequences.
Conclusion
55        For all the reasons above, there was no reasonable doubt in our minds that the appellant was guilty of the offence as charged. He had used the revolver and the law presumed that he had intended to cause physical injury. He failed to rebut the presumption, which was fully reinforced by the evidence before us. The legislative rationale underlying the presumption and accompanying mandatory death penalty in s 4 of the Act was articulated by the Minister during the debates in Parliament on the 1993 amendment to the Act, and we found his following words particularly pertinent when we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence of death passed:
The punishment for such offences should not be made dependent on an accused’s intention. A firearm is, as we all know, a very lethal weapon, and when fired, it can cause death or injury even to innocent bystanders in the vicinity, whatever the intention of the accused may be. Therefore, arms and firearms must be distinguished from other weapons like knives, parangs and so on. Not only to innocent bystanders but the discharge of a firearm has a tremendous effect of causing alarm on the population.
Sir, crimes of violence of this kind must be strongly deterred and suppressed. In particular, the unlawful use of arms must not be condoned. Otherwise, it will lead to greater use of arms for unlawful purposes in Singapore and we will face the experience of many other countries in this regard. Peace and good order, which we value so much in Singapore, will be threatened.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was an application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) to make absolute an order to show cause. We granted the application and ordered the respondent, Sarjit Singh s/o Mehar Singh, to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now give our reasons.
Facts
2          The facts of this case were undisputed. The respondent was called to the Bar in 1991 and was, at all material times, the sole proprietor of his firm, Sarjit Singh & Co. In October 1998, the respondent was engaged by one Muhammed bin Haji Abdul Latiff (“Latiff”) to recover outstanding salary amounting to $4,815.24 from his previous employer, Eurofibre Engineering Pte Ltd (“Eurofibre”). The respondent agreed to act for Latiff and charged him an initial downpayment of $200 to write a letter of demand to Eurofibre.
3          Upon receiving the letter of demand, Eurofibre promptly issued a cheque for the outstanding salary to “Sarjit Singh & Co”, dated 16 November 1998. The respondent did not inform Latiff that he had received the cheque. Instead, he advised Latiff that a writ of summons should be taken out against Eurofibre, since the letter of demand had not been effective. Latiff agreed, and the respondent then charged Latiff another $500 for the issuance of the writ. The respondent subsequently faxed Latiff a copy of a writ, which had purportedly been issued, with a forged signature of the then deputy registrar of the Subordinate Courts. Latiff had difficulty contacting the respondent thereafter.
4          Latiff then proceeded to make a police report. Investigations subsequently showed that the respondent had deposited the cheque from Eurofibre into his firm’s account and directed it to his own use. He was charged with one count of criminal breach of trust as an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The respondent claimed trial to the charge. At trial, the respondent claimed that he had acted for Latiff in another matter and had taken the moneys from the Eurofibre case to offset the legal costs. The district judge disbelieved his defence and convicted him accordingly. The respondent was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment.
5          The respondent then filed a petition for criminal revision to the High Court. On 3 September 2002, the High Court dismissed his petition, and enhanced the sentence to a term of three years’ imprisonment.
Show cause proceedings
6          Relying on the conviction, the Law Society applied to make absolute the order to show cause, as required under s 94A LPA. The Law Society contended that due cause had been shown under s 83(2)(a) LPA, which reads:
Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession.
At the first hearing on 30 January 2004, the respondent wrote a letter to the court requesting for an adjournment of the hearing until such time as he was released from prison, as he felt he would not be able to effectively present his arguments if he were in prison garb. We were of the view that his present circumstances did not prevent him from making viable submissions. Nevertheless, we granted an adjournment of one month. The respondent failed to attend on this second date, and requested that this court carry on in his absence, if they were not minded to adjourn the hearing until his release. We decided to proceed with the hearing.
7          Under s 83(6) LPA, this court must accept the respondent’s conviction as final and conclusive: 
Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh
 
[1996] 2 SLR 184
, 
Re Mohomed Jiffry Muljee
 
[1994] 3 SLR 520
. Given that the offence in question was one of dishonesty committed in his capacity as advocate and solicitor, that was sufficient, in itself, for this court to determine that due cause had been shown: 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
[2004] SGHC 36
.
Appropriate order to be made under s 83(1) LPA
8          We then considered the appropriate order to be made under s 83(1) LPA. The respondent was not present to submit on any mitigating factors. Regardless, we found that any mitigating circumstances, even if present, would have been of little avail. In a case involving an advocate and solicitor of proven dishonesty, the weight to be attached to a plea of mitigation is virtually negligible and a striking off would be a matter of course: 
Law Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick
 
[1999] 4 SLR 168
, 
Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam
 
[1994] 3 SLR 531
.
9          On the undisputed facts, we did not hesitate to find that the only appropriate order in this case was to strike the respondent off the roll. The respondent had acted in an abhorrent manner, setting out to cheat those whom he was meant to serve. The respondent not only concealed from his client the fact that he had received moneys in settlement of the letter of demand, but had also falsified documents to further deceive his client and cover his tracks.
10        In our opinion, the respondent had shown himself to be wholly bereft of integrity and utterly unfit for his profession. It was imperative that the respondent be struck off the roll to protect both the public and the good name of the profession. We further ordered that the respondent bear the costs of these proceedings.

Tay Yong Kwang J:
1          There were a total of 46 charges in this case. The Prosecution proceeded with 14 charges while the other 32 charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
2          The 14 charges that were proceeded with were six charges under s 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and eight charges under s 420 of the Penal Code.
3          The 32 charges taken into consideration comprised the following:
(a)        five charges under s 467 of the Penal Code;
(b)        eight charges under ss 465 and 471 of the Penal Code read with s 109 of the same;
(c)        four charges under s 408 of the Penal Code;
(d)        three charges under s 468 of the Penal Code;
(e)        ten charges under s 420 of the Penal Code; and
(f)         two charges under s 47(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed).
4          The Statement of Facts, accepted without qualification by the accused, set out in detail the circumstances leading to the commission of each of the offences proceeded with. The documents forged by the accused were enclosed with the Statement of Facts. A synopsis of the contents of the Statement of Facts appeared in the Prosecution’s “Summary of Facts”, reproduced in full below:
1          The accused is … a 44-year-old Singaporean male Chinese (Date of Birth: 11 October 1959; NRIC number S1383087H).
2          He has pleaded guilty before this Hono[u]rable Court to six charges under section 467 of the Penal Code and eight charges under section 420 of the same.
Background
3          The Accused joined Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“APBS”) as its Finance Manager on 20 January 1999. As the Finance Manager of APBS, he was responsible for all financial, accounting and bookkeeping matters of APBS.
4          APBS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Asia Pacific Breweries Limited (“APBL”), which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange Limited. Its principal activity is the manufacture of beer and related products. The Accused was transferred to APBL as the Senior Manager (Group Finance) on 14 July 2003.
5          The Accused was arrested on 2 September 2003 at the Commercial Affairs Department.
Investigations
6          Since 1994, the Accused had been gambling at casinos on board “Star Cruise” vessels.
7          Sometime between 1998 and early 1999, before he joined APBS, the Accused lost heavily in gambling and accumulated gambling debts amounting to more than S$1 million.
8          Shortly after the Accused joined APBS as its Finance Manager, he devised a plan in January 1999 to obtain credit facilities from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (“SEB”) for his personal use by using forged documents to open bank accounts with SEB in the name of APBS.
9          Emboldened by the successful execution of his devious plan, the Accused subsequently created several other fictitious documents between January 1999 and March 2003, in order to obtain, for his own purposes, further credit and loan facilities on behalf of APBS from four foreign banks operating in Singapore, namely:
(i)         SEB;
(ii)        the former Sakura Bank Limited, now known as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (“SMBC”);
(iii)       the former Fuji Bank Limited, now known as Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd (“Mizuho”); and
(iv)       Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft (“HVB”).
10         The credit and loan facilities were obtained from these banks without the consent and knowledge of APBS.
11         The numerous forged documents created by the Accused included certified extracts of directors’ resolutions. Forged between January 1999 and March 2003, these directors’ resolutions purportedly authorised him, as sole signatory, to receive the credit and loan facilities provided by the four banks, sign all transactions and operate the bank accounts, on behalf of APBS.
12         In order to forge the signatures of various directors of APBS, the Accused obtained their signature specimens from APBS annual reports and other internal documents. The Accused then practised signing their signatures on pieces of paper several times until he was satisfied that he could replicate their signatures.
13         Investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) revealed that the Accused obtained, by using forged documents, loan and credit facilities amounting to US$83 million and S$18 million collectively from these banks.
14         Investigations also disclosed that the Accused had fraudulently made several withdrawals from the credit and loan facilities provided by the banks between 1999 and 2003.
15         Between March 2003 and July 2003, the Accused also gave written instructions to the four banks to make the following withdrawals:
(i)         US$13 million from credit facilities provided by SEB on 20 March 2003;
(ii)        US$12 million from credit facilities provided by SEB on 19 May 2003;
(iii)       S$5 million from credit facilities provided by SMBC on 4 June 2003;
(iv)       S$5 million from credit facilities provided by SMBC on 29 July 2003;
(v)        US$3.5 million from credit facilities provided by Mizuho on 14 April 2003;
(vi)       US$3.5 million from credit facilities provided by Mizuho on 28 April 2003;
(vii)      US$1 million from credit facilities provided by Mizuho on 4 June 2003; and
(viii)      US$30 million from loan facilities provided by HVB on 21 March 2003.
16         Monies drawn from the credit and loan facilities between 1999 and 2003 were channeled into the SEB bank account, which was also fraudulently opened by the Accused in the name of APBS. A large portion of these monies were then transferred to the Accused person’s personal bank accounts (account nos. 022-010850-6 and 001-020579-0) maintained with the DBS Bank Limited (“DBS”) in Singapore, before being remitted to casinos in Australia, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Cambodia and the Philippines. These remittances were made for the purpose of financing the Accused person’s gambling activities at these casinos.
17         The Accused placed bets of about S$200 when he started gambling on board “Star Cruise” vessels. Stakes were slowly increased to about S$5,000 a hand. With the illegally obtained money, he started placing bets of A$20,000 and £25,000 in casinos in Australia and London respectively, before eventually enlarging his bets to A$400,000 a hand when he gambled in Crown Casino in Australia.
18         The Accused had cheated the four banks collectively of about S$117.1 million. CAD has managed to secure the recovery of just about S$34.8 million, from property seized in the course of investigations as well as voluntary remittances made by the Accused from bank accounts maintained by him overseas. Some S$62 million was squandered and lost at various casinos around the world.
The Prosecution’s submissions on sentence
5          The Prosecution argued that the sentencing principles of retribution and deterrence were of particular relevance here as this case “is the largest case of commercial fraud in the history of Singapore”. It highlighted the aggravating factors discussed below.
The sum of money involved
6          The accused cheated the four banks in question of an unprecedented total of $117.1m over some four years, out of which only the sum of $34.8m has been recovered. The loans and credit facilities granted amounted to some $159m.
How the accused used the money
7          “A colossal S$62 million of the banks’ money was frittered away throwing dice and flipping cards at the gambling table without restraint.” Being one of the biggest players in an Australian casino, he was provided with transport in a private jet whenever he wanted to gamble. Various casinos in Australia and in London extended personal invitations to him to visit them. The accused also used the illegally obtained money to purchase a Mercedes Benz car and an apartment in Francis Lodge, Singapore. He also gave away more than $300,000 in cash and gifts to various persons.
Blatant abuse of position of trust
8          Just five days after joining Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“APBS”) as its finance manager, the accused audaciously began his illegal endeavour, establishing a banking relationship with one of the banks by presenting forged documents. The four charges of criminal breach of trust under s 408 of the Penal Code, which will be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, involved $53m even though that sum was eventually returned to his employers.
Pre-meditation and planning
9          This was not a one-off offence committed on a surge of sudden impulse. The offences “required the systematic planning and pre-meditation of a criminal genius”. He diligently practised replicating the signatures of the various directors of his employers. Money drawn down from the credit facilities were channelled to the SEB current accounts fraudulently opened in the name of his employers. By rolling over the funds provided by the banks, the accused presented himself as a creditworthy customer by making timely remittances to each of the banks whenever repayments were due. He created the impression that money was being transferred from one company account to another.
Adverse impact on Singapore’s reputation as a financial hub
10        The accused’s actions have damaged our reputation as an honest and efficient financial hub. The foreign banks in question have invested substantially here.
11        The Prosecution also argued that the plea of guilt in the face of the “avalanche of evidence” against the accused should not attract a substantial discount in sentence (see 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
). The fact that the accused was a first offender was of little mitigating value and was at best a neutral factor unless there was positive evidence as to his character rather than negative inference from the absence of antecedents (see 
Xia Qin Lai
 
v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
).
12        The Prosecution also referred to two recent High Court cases decided by me. In 
PP v Teo Cheng Kiat
 
[2000] SGHC 129
 (unreported), an employee of Singapore Airlines who embezzled $34.9m of his employers’ funds was sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment term of 24 years on ten charges under s 408 of the Penal Code. In 
PP v Lam Chen Fong
 
[2002] 4 SLR 887
, an operator of a money remittance business was sentenced to an aggregate of 22 years in prison on 22 charges, 20 of which were under s 409 of the Penal Code. The amount misappropriated there was some $8.7m. Both accused persons in those two cases pleaded guilty.
13        Citing 
Sim Gek Yong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 537
, it was argued that the conduct of the accused here fell within a range of conduct which characterised the most serious instance of the offences in question. The offences were not motivated by need but by greed and there was “little doubt that the accused relished the thrill of high-stake gambling and enjoyed being revered at the casinos as a high-roller”. He would still be swindling the banks had he not been caught.
14        In view of the numerous charges involving multiple victims, the Prosecution urged me to order more than two imprisonment sentences to run consecutively. It was submitted that the gravity of the offences here warranted an aggregate term of imprisonment higher than the maximum term of 14 years which the district courts could impose by law.
The mitigation plea
15        The accused is married with two teenage sons. He graduated with a degree in accountancy from the National University of Singapore in 1983. Before joining APBS, he was the financial controller in another company.
16        He had been gambling and losing heavily since 1995/1996. By 1997, he owed several banks about $100,000. In 1996/1997, he organised a company function for his previous employers on board one of the Star Cruise ships and was invited to gamble in the private room in the casino. Having won a few thousand dollars on that trip, he began to gamble regularly on board Star Cruise ships and managed to win about $1m within a year. He was thus able to discharge his outstanding debts.
17        However, in August 1998, he had a severe reversal of fortune in gambling. He lost so much that even with help from his wife and his family, he could not settle his debts. Hounded by his creditors, he became a desperate man.
18        It was around that period that the accused joined APBS. “Driven to desperation”, he began to open bank accounts in the name of APBS using forged documents. He withdrew money from the accounts and transferred it to his own account or paid it directly to his creditors. The banks never questioned him as to why he was the sole signatory for the accounts. Out of the four banks in question, SEB was the only one that he had approached to open an account. The other three were the ones who approached him to canvass for business from APBS.
19        Initially, he was not very confident that SEB would extend the facilities but he was prepared to take the chance. Counsel for the accused submitted that:
A desperate man would resort to desperate means. He took the chance but he did not take advantage of the banking system. He had expected the banks to check on the authenticity of the documents and signatures as well as to verify the documents. He assumed that they would and had done so. He did not at any time hold himself as the person who pulled the strings at [APBS]. He was surprised when the facilities were extended.
Having succeeded in doing all this, he continued to take further chances and the facilities got bigger and the draw-downs increased. “The scheme would have fallen apart if the banks had done their due diligence. It is not a case of the accused knowing or having intimate knowledge that the banks will not do their due diligence.” The scheme hatched by the accused was just too simplistic and possibly too absurd to succeed and that should be taken into account in sentencing (see 
Nomura Taiji v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 173
).
20        The accused knew he had to return the money to the bank accounts. In his mind, he was “borrowing” the money and would return it with his winnings. He had no intention of fleeing with the money. He did not buy expensive goods or splurge on holidays. He lived in the same home and drove a car that he could support with his legitimate income. The illegally obtained money went straight to the casinos and back. It was not dissipated. The luxurious lifestyle he enjoyed was provided by the casinos as part of their package.
21        Infected by the gambling disease and obsessed with how he could return the money, he sought the highest bets available anywhere so that he could recover enough to cover his losses and repay the banks. That led to the situation where he was playing at A$400,000 a hand. He returned the winnings to the SEB account. He withdrew $53m from APBS’s account with OCBC Bank between November 1999 and October 2002 but returned the money over the period with no loss incurred by APBS and before his arrest.
22        He also did not draw down all the available funds. He had more than A$32m in his Westpac account and would have absconded long ago if it had been his intention to enrich himself.
23        In addition to the above, I was asked to consider his timely plea of guilt. He had indicated from the outset that he would be admitting the charges against him. Although such a plea would be of much less mitigating value if an offender had been caught red-handed or if the Prosecution would have no difficulty proving its case against him, due regard should be given to the time and expense saved. Witnesses from different jurisdictions now did not have to be called for what would have been a lengthy trial.
24        The accused co-operated fully with the investigators right from the moment he was questioned by them. Although the scope of their inquiry at that time was a very limited one, he not only answered their questions but also volunteered information on the other bank accounts, where most of the funds were held, and on the flow of the funds. He also helped in the tracing and the recovery of the money by signing all necessary papers. He thus saved the investigators a lot of time and effort. The extent of his co-operation attested to his remorse and regret and should be accorded some mitigating value (see 
PP v Lim Hoon Choo
 
[2000] 1 SLR 221
).
25        The complex flow of funds was not deliberately designed to avoid detection. It was simply the route he took to allow for the flow of funds to support his gambling habits. He did not use any fictitious names for his accounts.
26        There was restitution of about $34.8m representing almost 30% of the total amount he had illegally obtained. Where the $1.29m remitted to the authorities by his girlfriend, Li Jin, was concerned, the accused asserted that he had given her only S$254,000 and US$20,000. He claimed that the rest of that amount was Li Jin’s own money and should be returned to her. It would be to his advantage to increase the amount of restitution but he did not wish to implicate an innocent party.
27        In response to the Prosecution’s contention that the accused’s actions have damaged Singapore’s standing as an honest and efficient financial hub, the Defence argued that:
To a certain extent the ease in which the banks relied on the forged documents reveal that increased security measures must be put in place. This can be done by the banks themselves or by amendments to the regulatory legislation. These actions will certainly restore public and investor confidence which passing a crushing sentence on the accused can never hope to achieve.
28        The cases relied on by the Prosecution contained aggravating factors absent here. In 
PP v Teo Cheng Kiat,
 the offender doctored the reports daily over 13 years while 
PP v Lam Chen Fong
 involved a total of 1,202 charges, more than 1,000 victims who were foreign workers and an accused taking flight out of the jurisdiction. The present case took place over only about four years and the victims were all corporations numbering far fewer than in the case of the foreign workers.
29        Besides the absence of any previous criminal record, there was also positive evidence of the accused’s character, unlike in 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
. The accused assisted in fund-raising efforts for flood relief in Cambodia in 2001, resulting in a donation of US$100,000 by Asia Pacific Breweries Limited. A letter from the Senior Minister and First Vice President of the National Committee for Disaster Management of Cambodia dated 24 December 2003 was tendered as proof of this.
30        The accused was a filial son who looked after his aged and ailing parents. The two sons of the accused have also written a joint letter on 28 March 2004 to the court expressing their initial disappointment with their father for having brought them much anguish and humiliation but acknowledging upon reflection that it was only human to err, “albeit that the error he committed was of an unparalleled scale”. They spoke of their “very caring and loving father” with great affection, recalling incidents which demonstrated those attributes, in the hope of providing the court “with a more holistic profile” of their father. They ended their letter with the following words:
We also hope that you will grant us our dearest wish to see our father as a free man again earlier as lessening his sentence, is not only making it easier on him, but a lot easier on us, the people who are truly innocent in this case. Thank you very much.
31        Finally, it was submitted that the maximum sentence of life imprisonment was not appropriate here in the light of the mitigating factors. The accused did not siphon off any money to secret accounts and therefore would not have any opportunity of enjoying the fruits of his illegal acts upon release from prison. The aggregate sentence imposed should not be so harsh as to be crushing in its effect on the accused (
Maideen Pillai v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
).
The decision of the court
32        I am grateful to Deputy Public Prosecutor Thong Chee Kun for the Prosecution and Mr Edmond Pereira and Mr Benjamin Choo for the Defence for their invaluable assistance in bringing this case to a swift and smooth conclusion and for their thorough submissions. I congratulate the Commercial Affairs Department for having done a fine job in putting together the puzzling pieces of this complex jigsaw.
33        This is a case of a finance manager responsible for the accounting integrity of a reputable company turning forger and fraudster soon after joining the company. He was no mere corporate sentry; he was the commander of the guards. The implication of the mitigation plea appears to be that the crime was less serious because some of the victims walked through the door themselves without him seeking them out actively. It was unremarkable that the banks involved here would seek his acquaintance with the hope of establishing a profitable banking relationship with the company. Bankers knocking on his door were there to meet the man “responsible for all financial, accounting and bookkeeping matters of APBS” to forge a business relationship but the man they met was unfortunately in the business of forgery. They did not suspect for one moment that the financial wizard was conjuring up fake documents. The fact that they made “cold calls” on the accused therefore does not make his crimes of forgery and fraud more forgivable.
34        The mitigation plea also seems to be casting some blame on the banks cheated for having made it too easy for him to commit the offences by being too naïve and trusting or perhaps even negligent. That appears to be the thrust of the statement, “the scheme would have fallen apart if the banks had done their due diligence”. As mentioned, the banks believed, and rightly so, that they were dealing with a responsible head of finance of an established company. That is why the law regards abuse of positions of trust as an aggravating factor. I have said in 
PP v Teo Cheng Kiat
 that burglars should not be blaming house owners for leaving their gates open or using inferior locks. Similarly, forgers and fraudsters should not be decrying trusting or even gullible victims. The accused, accustomed to taking chances on gaming tables, took a gamble with SEB and was obviously elated that it paid off. That emboldened him to play for higher stakes.
35        In reply to the submission that the “simplistic scheme” of the accused was practically doomed to failure, I only need to point out that it was very successful for more than four years. Sometimes, the simplest solution or scheme is obvious only to a genius. The fact that his massive defalcations and movements of funds remained undetected for more than four years must surely attest to the correctness of the Prosecution’s assertion that this was the work of a criminal genius.
36        The illegal taking of money here was likened to “borrowing” by the Defence. It would appear then that the “loans” that the accused took had no repayment dates and were interest-free. The “loans” were also getting bigger over the years. How was he hoping to repay $62m worth of loans? He did not need to splurge on lavish overseas holidays because each gambling trip was a lavish, all-expenses-paid holiday. Were his massive gambling losses not the payments made in any event? His gambling trips using the illegally obtained funds were nothing more than a result of his addiction to gambling and to the grandeur and splendour of being treated like a royal flushed with slush funds.
37        While the accused may not have kept some secret account somewhere, he has squandered a sum which is enough to feed many people for life. The loss here, unlike that in 
Nomura Taiji v PP
, has already happened and the loss is great. In that case, it was because the amount of loss which 
could have
 resulted was “so astronomical” and “the scam was so ridiculous and absurd that it would never have succeeded in any event” that the court there said that it was not in every case that the sentence should reflect proportionately the amount of the loss that could result to the victim.
38        There are of course some points in the accused’s favour. By pleading guilty and indicating he was going to do so from the outset, a lot of time and expense in a potentially lengthy trial have been saved. However, this would have to be counter-balanced against the time and expense that would be involved in the litigation that is likely to be generated among the corporate entities ensnared by his misdeeds.
39        He has no criminal record and has done some good for the flood victims in Cambodia in 2001. I also note his co-operation with the investigators in helping to piece together the mess he had created and in recovering some 30% of the funds. It is fortunate for the accused that the Australian dollar has risen in value against the Singapore dollar resulting in a higher amount of restitution when the funds in Australian dollars were converted to local currency.
40        I am touched by the tender words of the two teenage sons of the accused. The accused may have lost everything else but he still has the immeasurably valuable gift of love from his two sons. Their young hands pen words that only mature mouths speak. To the two young men, whom I shall not address by name in this judgment out of respect for their privacy, I assure you the court appreciates your anguish and anxiety. Indeed, you should continue loving your father as his guilt is confined to the charges and none of them accuses him of being a bad dad. The court’s sentence will probably disappoint you but that is not because the court does not believe you.
41        I would like to add here that the accused is not being punished for being a gambler either.
42        Crimes such as the present case strike at the heart of banking and commerce. They erode the open halls of trust and erect the high walls of suspicion. They lead to ever more stringent checks by banks on honest businesses with the attendant impact in terms of time and cost.
43        Section 420 of the Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to seven years and a liability to fine while s 467 of the Penal Code provides for life imprisonment or a term which may extend to ten years and a liability to fine.
44        Weighing all the above factors and bearing in mind the 32 charges to be taken into consideration, I now pronounce sentence on Mr Chia Teck Leng. For each of the 14 charges on which he has been convicted, he is sentenced to undergo six years in prison. Seven of these imprisonment terms are to run consecutively with the other seven running concurrently with them making a total of 42 years. The commencement of the sentence is backdated to 2 September 2003, the date of his arrest.

The Facts
2          The prosecution’s case was that on 20 October 2001, in response to a 999 call (P12) at 9.02a.m that about twenty people were fighting with knives in front of Mr Bean Café, Prinsep Street, (PW8) Inspector Abdul Gafoor bin Idroos and a team of police officers proceeded to the scene. The team comprised (PW1) Senior Staff Sergeant Gurucharan Singh, (PW3) Sgt Mohamed Ameer Bin Mohd Hanifah, (PW4) W/Sgt Rabitah Bte Mohd Sidik, (PW5) Sgt Mohd Sarwani bin Hamsani, (PW6) Sgt Quah Boon Keat, (PW7) Sgt Jasli Bin Johari, (PW9) Sgt Ang Hwee Tat and (PW13) Senior Station Inspector Sajad Hussain Shah.
3          First to arrive at the scene at 4.15a.m in a patrol car were Sgt Mohd Ameer and W/Sgt Rabitah. When they drove along Prinsep Street some people at Mr Bean Café waved them down. The officers were informed that the persons who were involved in the fight were about to leave the scene in a Mercedes Benz motorcar and pointed to the officers where the car was. Immediately, Sgt Ameer drove ahead and overtook the said car.  He stopped it and two other cars opposite Sunshine Plaza along Prinsep Street.
4          By the time Sgt Ameer got out of the patrol car, the passengers and the drivers of the three cars had got out of their vehicles and approached him. There were about twelve male Indian persons. These persons began questioning Sgt Ameer why he had stopped them. Sgt Ameer did not give them an answer and requested for their personal particulars. The group refused to provide their particulars and they got rowdy by shouting at the top of their voices. The group smelt strongly of alcohol. According to W/Sgt Rabitah the group looked annoyed, aggressive and was going nearer and nearer Sgt Ameer. Sgt Ameer was trying to pacify the group. Among the persons in the group, Sgt Ameer saw the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth accused. He recalled speaking to the first accused. One of the accused persons told Sgt Ameer that the fifth accused was not involved in the fight. It was at this juncture, Insp Gafoor arrived at the scene and assisted in the investigation. Insp Gafoor spoke to the first accused who was uncooperative.  The first accused requested to be let off. Insp Gafoor also recalled seeing the eighth accused at the scene.
5          A few minutes later, Sgt Sarwani and Quah Boon Keat arrived at the scene. Sgt Quah noticed the second, third, sixth and eighth accused in the group of male Indian persons. The group was noisy and questioned the police officers. Sgt Quah testified when he called out to a male Indian person who was walking away from the scene, the third accused shouted at him and queried why he called his friend in a rude manner. The third accused then identified himself to be a civil servant and a senior officer with Customs. Despite Sgt Quah’s explanation that he was only calling out to the person, the third accused shouted even louder insisting that he was very rude and moved closer to him and causing Sgt Quah to step back. The third accused was angry, shouting loudly and gesturing with his hands. Sgt Quah warned the third accused several times to lower his voice otherwise he would be arrested for an offence of disorderly behaviour. The third accused ignored Sgt Quah’s warnings maintaining that Sgt Quah was very rude. As the third accused chose to ignore the warnings, Sgt Quah and Sgt Sarwani arrested the third accused and took down his personal particulars.  Subsequently, the third accused was arrested and escorted to Central Police Division.
6          Whilst at the scene Sgt Sarwani spoke to several witnesses namely, Goh Joo Kwan, Wong Chee Hoong, Yeo Kiat Liang, Peh Soon Wah and Marc Christopher Oliveiro. At the scene they identified to the officers those accused whom they saw involved in the fight.
7          At about 4.24a.m Sgt Jasli Bin Johari testified that when he arrived at the scene, Insp. Gafoor instructed him to stop a Mercedes car bearing registration number SCM 91H that had driven away from the scene. Immediately, Sgt Jasli gave chase and stopped the said vehicle after the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road near a Presbyterian Church. Sgt Ang Hwee Tat stated that when he approached the car he asked the occupants to come out of the car and they complied. The occupants began questioning the officers why the police were picking on them despite being informed by the officers that there was reason to believe or suspect that they were involved in a fight at Prinsep Street. Sgt Jasli identified the fifth, sixth and eight accused and another male Indian person in the car. One of them asked Sgt Jasli why he had stopped them from leaving the scene as they had permission to leave. When Sgt Jasli checked with Insp Gafoor on this, Insp Gafoor told him that he had not given permission to anyone to leave the scene. Upon noticing that the sixth accused was not wearing any shoes Sgt Jasli questioned him why he was barefoot. The sixth accused told him that he was preparing for fire walking.
8          Thereafter, Sgt Ang searched SCM 91H.  During the search of the car, Sgt Ang found an ice pick. On instructions from Insp. Gafoor, the eighth accused was then arrested. The sixth accused was also arrested. Thereafter, the fifth accused was escorted to Mohican’s pub to assist in the investigation conducted there.
9          Subsequently, Sgt Ameer proceeded to search one of the other cars there but nothing incriminating was found in it. After searching the car, Sgt Ameer found a chopper on a grass verge near where motor vehicle bearing registration number ET 6250R had stopped. After Insp. Gafoor was informed of the discovery, the area was cordoned off for photographs to be taken.
10        At about 5.00a.m that morning, Senior Staff Sergeant Gurucharan Singh arrived at Prinsep Street. Upon being briefed of what had happened he proceeded to Mohican’s Pub at No. 70 Prinsep Street. There he noticed that the glass door of the pub was smashed. At the scene SSSgt Singh saw the first, fifth and eight accused. After interviewing Peh Soon Wah, Yeo Kiat Liang, Ng Chee Leong and Marc Christopher Oliveiro, SSSgt Singh gave instructions for the accused persons to be arrested and escorted to Central Police Division. At the scene no one claimed ownership of the chopper and the pair of shoes.
11        Investigations further revealed that the motor vehicle bearing registration number ET 6250 R, a blue Mercedes Benz was registered to be belonging to the first accused. The motor vehicle bearing registration number SCM 91 H, a maroon Mercedes Benz was registered to be belonging to the eighth accused. Both cars were seized for investigations. A few days later, both cars were returned to the first and eighth accused. In the course of investigation, it was ascertained that motor vehicle bearing registration number SCA 9663 L, a white Mercedes Benz, was registered to be belonging to the fifth accused.
12        Evidence was also adduced from Mohan s/o Ranjangam, who testified that he, the fifth accused and one Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam were partners of Mohican’s pub which commenced business on or about 14 September 2001. After the commencement of business, he and the fifth accused had several misunderstandings over the running of the pub and the accounts. As a result of these misunderstandings he eventually bought over the fifth accused’s and Rajendran’s shares in the business in January 2002 and February 2002 respectively. As a result of this failed business venture, Mohan stated that he had suffered a overall substantial financial loss of approximately $140,000 in running Mohican’s pub till it finally ceased operations at the end of December 2002.
13        On 20 October 2001 at about 2.45a.m, Mohan stated that two of the accused persons came to the pub requesting for a drink. As the pub was due to close soon, he had to turn them away. They were disappointed and left. Mohan stated that he knew the two accused but he declined to identify them.
14        Between 3.20a.m to 3.30a.m while he was locking the main gate to the premises he saw a police patrol car parked opposite Mr Bean Café. He saw two police officers one of whom was a Malay officer. While he was talking to the fifth accused outside Mohican’s pub for about five minutes, a group of approximately ten male Tamil persons approached and spoke to him. He stated that he did not know how the group came to be at Prinsep Street. All the accused persons with the exception of the second and eighth accused persons were in the group of persons that approached him. He stated that he only saw the second accused later when the police detained him. As for the eighth accused he saw him approximately 200 to 300 metres away at Sunshine Plaza walking towards the direction of the pub. When he saw the eighth accused, he was running across a vacant plot of land towards Selegie Road whilst fleeing from his attackers.
15        Mohan clarified that at that time, the patrol car was not at the scene. He stated that the two persons who had earlier requested him for a drink were among the group of male Tamil persons. When the group approached him he was asked whether he was the owner of the pub. When Mohan confirmed that he was, he was immediately punched on the left side of his face. As a result he fell down to the ground. He got up and as he did so he saw the person’s face. He refused to identify this person who assaulted him. When he got to his feet, he pushed his assailant away and fled from the scene. Then he ran across a vacant piece of land to Selegie Road. It was at this juncture that he saw the eighth accused walking towards the pub. During the assault, Mohan stated that one of the persons in the group was armed with a sharp object, which the assailant used to scratch him on the left forearm leaving a mild scar. He did not know who it was who had scratched him and didn’t know what the sharp object was that scratched him. He also stated that he did not know if there were any other weapons used by the group of male Indians. He refused to identify his assailants because he did not want to make it difficult for himself. Since operating the pub he said he lost approximately $140,000 and had encountered problems with his partners. He was afraid that by identifying his attackers he would be making enemies and wanted to avoid this. Upon reaching Selegie Road, he stated he boarded a taxi alone and proceeded to Bugis. Later he proceeded back to the scene and assisted the police in their investigations. He did not seek medical treatment for the injury to his left forearm.
16        During the trial after being permitted to refresh his memory, the prosecution applied under section 147(1) of the Evidence Act to impeach Mohan’s credit and to substitute his oral evidence with that of his statement in accordance with section 147(3) of the said Act. The Court allowed the application.
17        With regard to the prosecutions’s application to impeach Mohan’s credit the court considered the following authorities on the issue of impeachment.  In 
Loganatha Venkatesan v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 677
 at page 695 the court stated there that :-
“It should be remembered that impeaching the credit of the witness is not confined to previous inconsistent statements made to the police under the CPC. Statements made by a witness in other situation, verbal or written, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence given in court, upon proof of such statements, maybe used by counsel for the opposing side to impeach his credit. A witness’ credit may also be impeached by reference to evidence the witness has given at the trial, say in the examination in chief, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence in cross-examination. Such a manner of impeaching the credit of the witness is no different from that adopted in impeaching the credit of a witness in cases falling under s 122(2) or of an accused under s 122(5) of the CPC (as the case may be) with respect to a previous statement made by the witness or acused to the police. To impeach his credit is to attack the credibility oof his evidence. In 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter
 (supra) at p 602, Yong Pung How CJ said :
“To impeach a witness’s credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of impeachment of a witness’s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on.”
In our opinion, there is no requirement that the trial judge must, at any stage of the trial, make a ruling on whether the credit of the witness is impeached. All that is required is that the court must consider the discrepancies and the explanation proffered by the witness for the purpose of the overall assessment of his credibility. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that an impeachment of the witness’s credit does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The Court must carefully scrutinize the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: see 
PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng
 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
 (HC) and 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter
 (supra). Thus regardless of whether his credit is impeached, the duty of the court remains, that is, to evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspect to believe.”
In Mohamed Zairi bin Mohamed Mohtar v PP
[1]
 
it was held that:-
“…it is settled law that the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between his oral testimony and previous police statements: 
Muthusamy v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 57
. Material inconsistencies are those inconsistencies that go to the crux of the charges against the appellants: 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 [1998[ 2 SLR 592. In determining whether the credit of the accused or a witness has been impeached, the court will compare the oral evidence with the previous statement to assess the overall impression which has been created as a whole: 
PP v Heah Lian Khin
 
[2000] 3 SLR 611
. …
..There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all: 
Jiminia Jacee d/o CD Athananasius v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 205
, 
Sundra Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 465
 following 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun Idris (No 2)
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
. To quote the words of Thomson CJ in 
Khoon Chye Hin v PP
 
[1961] 1 MLJ 105
:
“
 
If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his evidence must be scrutinized with great care and ndeed with suspicion. To say, however, that because a witness has been proved to be a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidence ‘must in law be rejected’ is to go too far and is wrong “
Whether or not an omission would amount to an inconsistency the Hon Chief Justice in 
Mohamed Zairi’s case
 clearly stated :-
“I adopted the position I took in 
PP v Heah Lian Khin supra
 that an omission will amount to an inconsistency when it would have been natural for the person to make the assertion in question”.
18        It was also held in 
PP v
 
Heah Lian Kin
 that the court must first find that there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between the witness’s oral testimony and his previous statement in writing before it grants leave to invoke s 147(1) or s 157(c) of the Evidence Act; (
Muthusamy v PP (1948) 14 MLJ 57, Somwang Phattanasaeng v PP 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
, Lim Yong Sien v PP
 
[1984] 2 SLR 257
 followed. In interpreting the phrase ‘ previous inconsistent’ or ‘contradictory statement’ a flexible as opposed to a rigid, semantic interpretation is preferred. In practice, there could be a wide variety of statements and an absolute oppositeness was not essential. The Court had to compare the oral evidence with the previous statement and to assess the overall impression, which had been created as a whole. The critical question was whether the two utterances, even if one of the utterance that “ I can’t remember” were in effect inconsistent and appeared to have been produced by incompatible beliefs. Due to the varying permutations of inconsistent statements, it would be unduly restrictive and unrealistic to confine the operation of the statutory provisions to a situation where the witness gives two affirmative versions of the facts.  A less semantic approach, which calls for a comparison of the oral testimony with the previous statement as a whole to determine whether they are compatible, congruent or consonant in substance, spirit or form, is preferred. A purposive approach should be adopted in interpreting legislation to give effect to the intent and will of Parliament. Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act allows a previous inconsistent statement to be admitted as substantive evidence of the facts stated. It supplements oral evidence and prevents the artificial exclusion of a possible source of evidence which should contain the truth. When a witness falsely claims to have no recollection of the material events, he contradicts the essence of his previous statements, which contains a detailed account. Such a witness is no different from a witness who gives false oral evidence. The phrase ‘ previous inconsistent or contradictory statement’ must necessarily encompass a witness who deliberately and falsely claimed that he was unable to recall the facts. However, the court would still be required to evaluate the credibility of the witness’s testimony and the weight to be attached to the previous statement would be governed by the safeguards set out in section 147(6) EA and the following factors: contemporaneity of statement, possibility of misrepresentation, explanation for inconsistencies, context of statement, cogency and coherence of facts relied on. A failure to assert a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it amounts in effect to an assertion of the non-existence of the fact. Whether silence or omission amounts to an inconsistency depends upon the individual circumstances of each case. The test is, would it have been natural to for the person to make the assertion in question. If the two statements made by the witness cannot stand together and the statement in court is such that the witness would necessarily have made at the time of the earlier statement, then alone omission thereof can be considered to be a contradiction.
19        The court also considered 
Thiruselvam s/o Nagaretnam v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 125
 on the admissibility of witnesses statements. In that case the Court of Appeal held that –
“where s 147 (Evidence Act) was invoked and a previous statement of a witness, who is not the accused in the proceedings before the court, is used to cross-examine him and also to prove the existence of certain facts stated therein, what is required is to be proved is that the statement was made by the witness. There is no requirement to prove further that the witness made the statement voluntarily. We are reinforced in our view by the provisions of s 147(6), which provides:
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any reasonable inference can be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, as to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the makerof the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts”
Where however, the witness is an accused person himself, then the application of s147 is subject to s 24 of the Evidence Act and also s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, if the latter is applicable. In other words, if the statement is a confession, then before the use of that statement under section 147, it must be proved that the statement was made by the accused voluntarily. If the statement is not a confession but falls within s 122(5) of the Code, equally it must be proved that the statement was made by the accused voluntarily. This requirement is specifically enjoined by the respective statutory provisions. In conclusion, insofar as P29 is concerned there was no requirement to conduct a voir dire to determine that it (the statement) was made by Katheraven voluntarily before ot is admitted for cross-examination or as substantive evidence under section 147 of the Evidence Act. It does not follow, that the court can ignore the question of voluntariness in the making of the statement. If it is raised in the process of examination and cross-examination of the witness, and it is found that the statement was not made voluntarily, that is certainly an important factor to be considered in determining the weight to be accorded to the statement.” 
20        In applying these principles the court then went on to consider Mohan’s evidence. Mohan admitted that he had given a voluntary statement on 29 August 2002 (P39) and a voluntary further statement on 10 October 2003 (P40) to the police. In reference to the statement (P39), he was asked by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor whether there was an incident with the eight accused two weeks prior to the 20 October 2001 which was omitted in evidence-in-chief. Apparently, during this incident, the eighth accused friends, comprising fifteen to twenty people, claimed that they were going to smash the pub. Subsequently, when the fifth accused arrived, he too threatened to smash the pub because Mohan had been rude to the eighth accused. Mohan agreed that though the incident did take place he explained that this was one of several misunderstandings he had with the fifth accused but nothing happened to the pub.
21        Regarding the incident on 20 October 2001 at 3.00a.m, Mohan explained that the two persons who came to the pub were the first and sixth accused. Not only were they disappointed that he could not serve them drinks, he said he also sensed that that they were purposely asking for trouble because they knew the time for the last order. He then asked a customer, one Vengadeswaran Gobi, to explain to the first and sixth accused the constraints of serving drinks after business hours. When he was asked to explain why he stated in his statement that the sixth accused called for back up he stated that the sixth accused misinterpreted what Gobi. He explained that what he meant to say was that Gobi and the sixth accused, would explain matters to the others and see to it that they leave the pub. He added that he couldn’t remember mentioning that the sixth accused misinterpreted what Gobi had said and called for back up. He wasn’t out of the pub yet for back up to be called.
22        When confronted with what he said in his statement (P39) at paragraph 9 and his testimony that he did not know how the group of male Tamils arrived at Prinsep Street, he admitted that he saw three cars entering the car park at Prinsep Street and eleven to twelve persons alighting from them.  One of the vehicles was an old Mercedes Benz and could not remember any details about the other motor vehicles. When asked to explain whether he had said that he saw the sixth accused armed with an axe approaching Gobi, he explained that Gobi had told him that the sixth accused had brought a “thing” and this is what he told the recording officer. He added too that it might have been a knife. He could have used the words axe or parang. His statement that the first accused, seventh accused and other assailants approached him and wanted to attack him is true but added that he made no mention of a knife only to a sharp object. He said that what he had stated in his statement was based on facts obtained from Gobi, Geetha and Selvarajo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah. He claimed that he did not witness the incidents he described in his statement (P39).
23        Mohan claimed that when his further statement was recorded on 10 January 2003, he co-operated with the police in identifying his assailants from a total of eighteen unmarked photographs of nine male Indian persons shown to him. There were two photographs of each suspect. He explained that he had co-operated with the police in their investigations and from the photographs shown to him had identified the eight accused persons and elaborated what each of them did. He identified the first accused as the person who punched him on the face. With regards to the second accused and third accused, he stated he was not sure of their roles in the incident. He identified the fourth accused as the person who punched Gobi and entered Mr Bean Café and threatened the patrons. Gobi had told him that he was standing at Mr Bean Café when the fourth accused punched him and went away. The fifth accused instigated the rest to fight pointing out whom to fist. Mohan claimed that Rajendran had told him that. However, as to whether the sixth accused was armed with an axe he said too, that Appu Rajah told him that fact when he was present at the scene at the time. He identified the seventh accused as the person who scratched him on the left forearm with a sharp object. Finally he identified the eighth accused as having driven some of the accused to the scene in a Mercedes Benz bearing registration number SCM 91.
24        Mohan stated that when he returned to the scene after the fight he could not recall whether he did speak to the fifth accused. However, in his statement he stated that the fifth accused had told him that the weapons that were used in the fight were concealed in his car and that his brother had driven it away.
25        It was clear from Mohan’s testimony that he was a reluctant witness who refused to identify his assailants despite the fact that he knew them because he was afraid of reprisals. His account of the incident in Court differed materially from what he had stated in his statement (P39) and further statement (P40). The accused persons were customers of his pub. He had seen and knew them before this incident could easily identify them, which he did in his statements but not in Court. In his statement, he gave a detailed account of what happened and did not inform the recording officer S Vikneswaran that he was revealing facts not within his personal knowledge when his statement was being recorded. He denied that all the facts that he revealed were of events he personally witnessed. He claimed that in the course of investigations he told the recording officer generally what happened. He denied being asked by the recording officer to only reveal facts he had witnessed.
26        S Vikneswaran testified that when he recorded the Mohan’s statement (P39) and further statement (P40) in Tamil and in English, he had shown him photographs (P40) and (P47) of male Indians persons, which included all the eight accused persons. Before the statement was recorded SSSgt Vikneswaran clearly told Mohan to relate to him only what he saw. Mohan narrated to him the events as they transpired. Mohan also identified to him the accused persons and the roles they played in the incident. SSSgt Vikneswaran admitted that in the recording of the statement (P39) that Mohan was shown photographs of the persons he identified. He mentioned that there was an error in the statement (P39) at paragraph 7. The date should be 19 October 2001 and not 20 October 2001. SSSgt Vikneswaran also testified that when Mohan was interviewed before the trial he reflected his reluctance in testifying as he was fearful of reprisals.
27        On the totality of Mohan’s evidence I was satisfied that he was a reluctant and evasive witness. He was not wholeheartedly truthful in his account of the assault on him. He was obviously fearful of reprisals from the accused persons if he elected to identify then in Court because he is currently managing another pub and didn’t want to court any more trouble. He also stated that before the commencement of the trial he had been approached to resolve the matter and not make enemies.
28        Accordingly, I find his testimony to be unreliable and his evidence substituted with his statements (P39 & (P40) in accordance with the principles laid down in 
Public Prosecutor v Heah Lian Kin
 [MA 354/1999]. What he had stated in his statements (P39) and (P40) seemed closer to the truth.
29        It was also noted that at that time Mohan had expressed his disappointment that he was the last witness to be interviewed by the police and he was concerned that the police had taken such a long time to conclude investigations into the matter. In the circumstances, it was more likely than not that at the time his statement was recorded he must have given his utmost co-operation to the police in giving a detailed account to the best of recollection of what the accused persons did at the scene on the night in question. He obviously had a change of heart after being approached to drop the matter against the accused persons and having started a new business. As he said he did not want “to bring trouble to himself”.
30        Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam the other partner of Mohican’s Pub testified that on or about 12 October 2001, the fifth accused’s father namely, the eight accused went to Mohican’s pub with a few of his friends. As one or two of the eighth accused’s friends were attired in shorts, they were stopped by Mohan from patronising the pub as there was a dress code. The eighth accused and his friends sat outside and after their drinks left the pub. The following day, Rajendran told the fifth accused what had happened when the latter telephoned him. Upset that the eighth accused was treated badly, the fifth accused, said he wanted to withdraw from the partnership. The fifth accused was told that this would be conveyed to Mohan. Aside from this incident, Rajendran testified that the partnership encountered a number of legal problems over the tenancy agreement. He said that he noticed that the cashier’s sales figures did not tally with the amounts in a textbook. Furthermore, Mohan alleged that the fifth accused had been pilfering money from the pub
31        Rajendran also testified that on 20 October 2001 between 12.30a.m and 1.00a.m the first accused, third accused and the sixth accused came to the pub and requested for a drink. As it was closing time they were informed that as the pub was closing no drinks would be served to them. Before leaving, the first accused told him in a loud tone of voice that he should recognise the pub’s regular customers.
32        Subsequently, the fifth accused telephoned him and told him that he was coming to the pub to speak to Mohan. A short while later a police patrol car stopped outside the pub and an uniformed officer spoke to the pub’s security officer one Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah and inquired if there was a fight. After he was told that there was no fight, the officer left.
33        Whilst outside Mohican’s pub along Prinsep Street, Rajendran testified that he saw the fifth accused standing outside No. 66 Prinsep Street. He was with his girlfriend one Jarina Banu. When Rajendran approached the fifth accused, the fifth accused told him that he wanted to speak to Mohan who was then outside the pub. When Mohan spoke to the fifth accused Rajendran who was standing nearby overheard Mohan who was a bit tipsy, speaking in a loud voice and using vulgar language on the fifth accused. Also present during the argument was one Geetha. When Mohan told Rajendran to go away, he went to close up the pub for the night. The fifth accused too, told him not to interfere as they were good friends for many years. Apparently, they caused a commotion.
34        This commotion was overheard by off duty police Sergeant Peh Soon Wah and Goh Joon Kuan and Marc Christopher Oliveiro who were then at Mr Bean Café situated opposite Mohican’s pub. Sgt Peh, Goh Joo Kuan and Marc Oliveiro customers of Mr Bean Café occupied tables that were situated on the pavement facing Mohican’s pub. Sgt Peh testified that he heard the group of four to five male Indian persons arguing. He noticed that one of the persons in the group was a female Indian person. Before the argument, Sgt Peh said he saw the fifth accused standing beside a white Mercedes Benz motor car that was parked at Prinsep Street between Nos. 64 and 66 Prinsep Street.
35        According to Sgt Peh, the argument sounded angry and agitated. He saw the fifth accused arguing with four to five male Indians and a female Indian person. They were shouting at each other. Sgt Yeo Kiat Liang who was with Sgt Peh and friends testified that he too, saw a group of approximately twenty male Indian persons causing a commotion outside Mohican’s pub. They were talking in a hostile manner and gesturing. He too saw the fifth accused. Also present were the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused persons. He observed the commotion for approximately five minutes.
36        The argument was also heard by one Daniel Vijay and Vegadeswaran Gobi.  Both testified that he saw the fifth accused arguing with Mohan outside the pub. Vagadeswaran Gobi overheard an argument about money matters and club ownership. It was closing time and customers were leaving the pub. Daniel Vijay testified that whilst the two of them were arguing, the sixth accused joined them. He overheard the fifth accused saying “You have cheated the club”. In the course of the argument the fifth and sixth accused uttered abusive words. Subsequently, the fifth accused whilst walking away made a telephone call.  Vegadeswaran Gobi overheard the fifth accused speaking to his father. When the fifth accused was near the Elections Department, both Daniel Vijay and Vegadeswaran Gobi saw four cars arrive and simultaneously park one behind the other, along Prinsep Street near to the fifth accused. One of the vehicles was ET 6250. Daniel Vijay saw the first accused alight from the driver’s side and speak to the fifth accused. Three to four other persons too, alighted from the car.  He was unable to identify any of the persons who alighted from these four cars. He saw a knife taken out from the boot of the first accused’s car. When the first accused was opening the boot of the car, the fifth accused was standing near him. He saw objects in the hands of the persons who alighted from the car. Two or three persons alighted from the other cars. The group comprising about twelve persons gathered before walking towards Mohican’s pub. Daniel Vijay said that the group chased some persons and flowerpots were thrown onto the road and broken.  He also heard sounds of things breaking. When he saw a patrol car arrive at the scene he walked to Bencoolen Street and left for home.  Vengadeswaran Gobi too left the scene.
37        Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh both testified that they saw two police patrol cars arrive at the scene. When the patrol car arrived, the group scattered from the scene. More than ten male Indian persons left and walked towards Prinsep Link. The police officers left after speaking to the remaining persons in the group.
38        Senior Station Inspector II (SSI) Sajad Hussein Shah testified that upon receiving a message of a fight at Prinsep Street he proceeded there. Upon his arrival in the vicinity of Mohican’s pub he met Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah. Having ascertained from Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah that nothing was amiss at the pub, he left.
39        Sgt Peh testified that after the police car left, the same persons regrouped and began arguing again. Sgt Yeo noticed that when the group of male Indians returned he saw some of them holding poles behind their backs.  In this group of persons, Vengadeswaran Gobi identified the eight accused.  They approached the management of Mohican’s pub.  He said there was an argument resulting in a scuffle between the two groups of persons that comprised about eighteen persons.
40        (PW14) Goh Joo Kwan too testified that night between 2.00a.m. and 3.00a.m he was at Mr Bean Café and was seated with his friends namely, Marc Christopher Oliveiro, Ng Chee Leong and one Ah Boy. Their table was along the side of the café’ in the open air. Goh Joo Kwan was seated facing No 74 & 76 Prinsep Street. Whilst there he saw he saw a group of five to six persons having an argument. He heard the words “What?. What?.” being said in a loud and angry tone which drew his attention to the what was going at Prinsep Street outside Mohican’s pub. Then he saw a fight break out. He saw some persons chasing other persons. In the melee, he saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused fighting. He saw the sixth accused holding a small knife and chasing someone. Whilst there he also saw a blue Mercedes Benz bearing registration number ET 6250 R and a white Mercedes Benz car proceed along Prinsep Street in the direction of Middle Road. The blue Mercedes Benz stopped outside Mr Bean café near where he was seated. He saw several persons come out of the vehicle. They proceeded to the boot of the car and took something out of it before walking to the pub.
41        During the argument, Sgts Peh and Yeo both said they saw a blue Mercedes Benz stop in front of Mohican’s pub. The car stopped near the fifth accused. The first accused alighted from the car and began shouting at the group. Sgt Peh said he saw a group of persons running towards a group of persons. Some members of the group were carrying poles and ice picks.
42        Rajendran too testified that before he took a taxi and left the vicinity he saw a group of male Indians running towards the direction of the pub. Some people in the group carried some things. He was unable to identify what they were carrying. Daniel Vijay testified that he saw a knife being taken out of the boot of the first accused car.   At the time when the first accused was opening the boot of the car the fifth accused was standing near him.  Three to four other persons were also standing near the car held objects in their hands.
43        Rajendran testified that whilst outside the pub with Appu Rajah and barman Hussain, the same police officer whom he had seen earlier returned and spoke to Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah. By then he and Hussain were walking to Mr Bean café which was on the opposite side of the road. Mohan was still talking to the fifth accused. While standing outside Mr Bean Café with Hussain and Geetha who had decided to join them, the fourth accused was seen alighting from a taxi that stopped near the pub. The fourth accused was seen talking to Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah for a while before proceeding to where Mohan and the fifth accused were.
44        After meeting the fourth accused, Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah testified that whilst he was walking along Prinsep Street towards Prinsep Link, he met the eighth accused who told him that he had come to meet the fifth accused. After he had taken three steps he saw two persons fighting. He was unable to identify these two persons. He said he saw one person on top of the other. The person on top of the other held something wrapped in newspaper. When he saw this, he took the object from that person. Just then he saw four to five persons running towards him. They were running towards Prinsep Street from the direction of Selegie Road across the vacant piece of land. This group of persons whom he was also unable to identify shouted “Champur” and abusive words as they ran towards him. Thereafter, with the object in hand he ran into Prinsep Link and threw the object in the direction of the Elections Department. This object was not recovered. Hailing a taxi, Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Raja left the scene and proceeded to St. George’s Road.
45        Sgt Peh testified that when the fight broke out, there appeared to be two groups of persons, one group was chasing another group of persons. Sgts Peh and Yeo both saw persons kicking and punching each other. The scene was chaotic. Sgt Yeo saw the fifth accused pushing some male Indian persons when the fight started. Sgt Peh saw the first accused shouting aggressively.  He also saw the eighth accused at the scene shouting.  When the fight broke out, the whole group started to fight.  The group was armed with wooden poles and ice picks.  Goh Joo Kwan testified that he saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused fighting. He also identified the second accused to be orchestrating the fight.
46        Goh Joo Kwan whilst under cross-examination by counsel requested to refer to his police statement and to several unmarked photographs of the accused persons in order to be sure about his identification of them. He stated that the incident happened along time ago and wished to refresh his memory in order to confirm the identification of the accused persons mentioned in his statement. He stated that due to the passage of time their looks have changed.
47        In re-examination the prosecution applied under s 161(2) of the Evidence Act that Goh Joo Kwan be afforded this opportunity to refresh his memory. All counsels for the accused objected to Goh being allowed to refer to these photographs submitting that the photographs are not fall within the ambit of section 161 of the Evidence Act.  However, all counsels conceded that though the witness could refer to his statement to refresh his memory, he could not refer to the photographs. They argued that the photographs were only secondary to his initial identification of the accused persons at the scene. The prosecution however argued that Goh Joo Kwan should be allowed to refresh his memory with regards the identification of those accused persons with reference to photographs and or other documents referred to the statement. In the course of recording Goh Joo Kwan’s statement and further statement the recorder had shown sixteen unmarked and unlabelled photographs of nine male persons to him. Goh Joo Kwan maintained that he had identified several accused persons at the scene to the police. He was not formally introduced to an identification parade in the course of police investigations but had identified several accused persons at the scene. In a further statement with reference to the photographs he described what he saw the accused persons do during the incident.
48        It was noted that Goh Joo Kwan was not the only witness to be shown photographs of several Indian persons including those of the accused persons by SSSgt Vikneswaran.  SSSgt Vikneswaran testified that he was the third investigating officer who took over the investigation of the case.  He stated that no identification parade of the accused persons was held. During the police investigations he had shown Goh Joo Kwan and Mohan unmarked photographs of several male Indian persons. From these unmarked photographs both Goh Joo Kwan and Mohan identified to him all the accused persons and what he saw them do during the incident and accordingly recorded it down in their statements.
49        In deciding whether or not to permit Goh Joo Kwan to refresh his memory and to refer to the photographs, the Court considered several decisions on the effect of identification by photographs. The general rule has been that while identification by photograph is acceptable in law, it has always been held that once a man has been arrested the identification should be by personal inspection (
Lai Ah Kam & Anor v Rex (1939) MLJ 306, Chooi Kam Who v Reg (1954) 20 MLJ 264, PP v Kok Heng & Others (1948) MLJ 171).
 From the decided cases the objection to the admissibility of such photographs is based primarily on the fact that the photographs by themselves gave the witness a bad impression of the accused because of certain numbers and markings on the photographs suggesting that they are of a wanted man (
Girdari Lall v PP (1946) 12 MLJ 87, Loke Soo Har v Public Prosecutor (1954) 20 MLJ 149)
 referred
.
 If there is identification by photograph, the identification by which it is held must be flawless ( 
PP v Kok Heng(1948) 14 MLJ 171)
 referred
.
50        As to whether the evidence should be taken into account reference was made to
PP v Manit Wangjaisuk
 
[1995] 1 SLR 326
. The Court of Appeal observed in the case where the respondent had been identified from photographs they stated :-
“Lastly, Inspector Lim also testified that whilst no formal identification parade had been held in respect of the respondent, he had nevertheless been identified by the fourth accused from photographs shown to the latter by the inspector. Indeed the first and second accused too were identified by the fourth accused from photographs on the same occasion. Counsel for the respondent urged us to disregard this testimony for the reason articulated by the trial judge, namely that Inspector Lim had failed to describe or produce in the court photographs shown to the fourth accused. With respect, such a failure constituted a factor affecting only the accuracy of the identification evidence; and accuracy, as Lord Diplock  stated in Haw Tua Tau v PP 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 is not a relevant factor in a trial court’s consideration of the evidence against an accused at the close of the prosecution’s case. In our view therefore, the evidence of the fourth accused identification of the respondent should have been taken into account by the court at the close of the prosecution’s case”
51        Applying the principles in the above cases the Court ruled that as the photographs were plain unmarked photographs that gave no indication to the viewer that it was of a wanted man, Goh Joo Kwan was permitted to refer to the photographs (P40) in order to refresh his memory pertaining to his identification of the accused persons because identification of the accused was a crucial issue to be determined in the case.
52        The photographs (P40) which included those of the accused were admitted in evidence. Goh Joo Kwan upon looking at the photographs maintained that the person in the seventh photograph i.e. the second accused, was at the scene orchestrating the fight. Furthermore, he maintained that at the scene he had also pointed out the accused persons to the police officers. He said that he also recognised the second accused at the police station. He admitted that when he made his further statement on 22 October 2003 he did not mention the second accused because he was asked to state briefly what he could recall. Goh Joo Kwan stated that when he was shown unmarked photographs of several male Indian persons including those of the second accused, he identified the second accused as B4 in his statement. When the photographs were shown to him when he gave a detailed account of what he saw them doing at the scene when his statement was recorded. On examining the said photographs (P40) there was no indication whatsoever on them that would have led Goh Joo Kwan to come to the conclusion that they are of wanted men. Goh Joo Kwan claimed that it had been a considerable period of time since the incident during which time the accused looks have changed. He just wanted to look at the photographs to be absolutely sure in court of his identification of second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth accused persons.  He was certain of his identification of the accused persons.  He described the second accused as orchestrating the fight.  The third accused threatened him and the customers with a dagger.  The fifth accused warned the customers of Mr Bean Café not to interfere.  He saw the sixth and seventh accused climbing into the pub.  He also saw the sixth accused chasing someone with a knife.  He saw the eighth accused walking along the road pointing here and there.
53        
 
Sgt Peh testified that he saw the first and eighth accused at the scene.  Sgt Yeo said he saw a group of about twenty persons talking and gesturing in a hostile manner.  They created a commotion.  Among the group he saw the fifth accused talking to one Indian person.  His behaviour was hostile and was gesturing with his hands.  The fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused were present there.  He also saw the eighth accused talking to the fifth accused.  He could not positively identity the second accused as being present but said that he looked familiar to him. Sgt Yeo also testified that he saw people with wooden poles hitting each other.  He also saw a male Indian person drop and pick up an ice pick about a metre in front of him. After picking up the ice pick the person resumed the chase.  During the fight Sgt Yeo saw the fifth accused pushing some people. 
54        
 
When the fight broke out Marc Oliveiro who was at Mr Bean’s Café was concerned that his parked car in the middle of Prinsep Street might get damaged. When he saw the fight progress in the direction of Sunshine Plaza he decided to go to his car to drive it away. Whilst starting his car, he noticed a male Indian person running from Sunshine Plaza towards him. It was the fourth accused who came up to him whilst he was seated in the car. Marc Oliveiro testified that the fourth accused smelt of alcohol. The fourth accused grabbed his shirt and threatened him a chopper, that the fourth accused took out from under his shirt. Immediately, Marc Oliverio opened his car door and fled from the scene towards Park Lane shopping mall.
55        
 
Goh Joo Kwan testified that when he saw Marc being accosted he wanted to help him but before he could do so, the third accused who held a dagger approached him and said “ Relax, sit down, Mai Chap” which in Hokkien meant ‘don’t interfere”. The fifth accused was also present and he too told the other customers at Mr Bean Café “Mai Chap”. The fifth accused was also shouting.
56        Shortly, Marc Oliveiro returned to Mr Bean Café.  He did so when he realised that the fourth accused had stopped chasing him. During the fight, Sgt Peh also testified that he saw approximately four persons climb over the front wall into Mohican’s pub. Of the four persons he identified the first accused and fourth accused entering the pub. He saw the first accused throwing as chair at the glass panel. He also saw the fourth accused smash the glass panel with a beer barrel. After smashing the glass panel, they climbed out Mohican’s. Goh Joo Kuan testified that he saw the sixth and seventh accused climbing into the pub. He stated that he could identify the seventh accused as being one of the persons who climbed into the pub because he saw the seventh accused’s face when he fell twice whilst attempting over the wall upon entering and leaving the premises.  He saw the seventh accused smashing the glass door of the pub with a beer barrel.  Goh Joo Kwan also testified that he saw someone smash the gate post lights of the pub. Sgt Yeo too, witnessed the incident and identified the first accused as the person who smashed the two gate post lights of the pub. Sgt Yeo stated that he saw the first accused, fourth accused and two others climb over the front wall into Mohican’s pub. He saw the first accused and fourth accused throw a beer barrel at the glass door shattering it. Some flower pots were also broken.  Daniel Vijay, too saw flower pots thrown on the road.
57        After the fight, Sgt Peh saw the first accused, fourth accused and two other persons talking to each other beside the blue Mercedes car. Sgt Peh also saw the fifth accused, walking up and down Prinsep Street before leaving in a white Mercedes car. The first accused too left the vicinity in his car with three other persons. When the first accused car was somewhere opposite the Election department, a police patrol car stopped it and detained all of the accused persons.
58        Goh Joo Kwan also saw the blue Mercedes Benz leaving the scene proceeding towards the junction of Middle Road before it was stopped by the police. Sgt Yeo too stated that when he saw the blue Mercedes Benz travelling past the Election Department, he saw some persons running to a maroon Mercedes Benz that was parked in front of the Election Department.  Subsequently, when a search of the grass patch near the said car was conducted, a chopper (P34) was recovered.  Marc Oliveiro identified this chopper (P34) to be similar to the one the fourth accused had threatened him with.
59        Meanwhile, at Hougang, Rajendran and Hussain alighted from the taxi whilst Geetha continued her journey in it to her home. Rajendran and Hussain had gone to a 24-hour Coffeeshop where they had a drink before going to their respective homes.
60        At Bugis, Mohan testified that he met a friend. Sometime past 4.00a.m that morning he proceeded back to the pub with his friend and upon his arrival at the scene was met by the police. He assisted the police in their investigations.
61        Rajendran testified that whilst at home the fifth accused telephoned him and told him that the pub had been smashed and to open it up. Rajendran thought the fifth accused was joking and ended the call. The fifth accused called Rajendran again and told him to go down to the pub and see the show. Thereupon, Rajendran telephoned Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah and Hussain and informed them of what had happened. Thereafter, Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellmuthoo @ Appu Rajah, Rajendran and Hussain proceeded  to Mohican’s pub. They alighted from a taxi at the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road as the police had cordoned off the area. Arriving at the pub, Rajendran noticed that a glass panel at the front of the pub was smashed. Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah opened up the pub. Hussain after checking the pub reported that nothing was missing. Mohan and the fifth accused were at the scene too.
62        Later that same morning SSI Sajad returned to Mohican’s pub pursuant upon receipt of another message of fight there. Upon his arrival at Prinsep Street he saw broken flowerpots along the side of Prinsep Street near the Elections department. SSI Sajad then preserved the scene till the arrival of the investigating officer Gurucharan Singh.
63        In closing its case the prosecution offered eleven witnesses to the defence.
Close of Prosecution's Case
64        At the close of the prosecution’s case, the court bore in mind the principles applicable to trials laid down by the Privy Council in 
Haw Tua Taw v PP
[2]
that is,
“… that at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking then, and then only, is he justified in finding ‘that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction’, within the meaning of section 188(1) [now s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code]. Where he has not so found he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as a decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution’s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides may make to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may to advance”.
Rioting
65        In respect  to the charge of rioting with a deadly weapon under section 148 of the Penal Code the Court also considered the principles laid down by the Honourable Chief Justice in 
Lim Thian Hor v Public Prosecutor
[3]
that the
 
common object falling within section 141 of the Penal Code was a prerequisite of an unlawful assembly. For there to be a common object, a common intention need not be established and sometimes the two could overlap. It was also decided in the case that the question of whether the others in the group were friends of the accused or even known to him was not central to the issue. At the highest, it was relevant only in so far as forming part of the overall evidence from which the court could draw an inference of common object. The mere fact that the others were unknown to the accused did not
 
mean that there was an absence of a common object as other direct and circumstantial evidence must be considered. Furthermore, common object must be distinguished from a similar object. The similar object only became common when all the persons who constituted the assembly were aware of it and concurred in it. Mere presence in the assembly did not make an accused a member of an unlawful assembly, unless there was direct or circumstantial evidence to show
 
that the accused shared the common object of the assembly. This was a question of fact to be inferred whether the accused happened to be innocently present at the place of the occurrence or was actually a member of the unlawful assembly.
66        In 
PP v Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak
[4]
 
the Honourable Chief Justice stated that:
“ it is well established that in order to show “common object”  for the purposes of section 141 and section 146 of the Penal Code, no pre-arranged plan is necessary. The meaning of “common object” is different from “common intention”, in that the former does not require prior concert, or a common meeting of minds before the attack. Thus the Court of Appeal ruled in 
Chandran v Public Prosecutor
[5]
 
that.
It is erroneous in our view to suggest that the prosecution must prove the common object of killing in a prosecution involving section 149 of the Code. All the necessary ingredients to sustain the convictions were properly found by the trial judges. Section 149 does not require proof of a pre-arranged plan and a common intention, which a prosecution involving section 34 of the code would require. The ‘common object’ under section 149 of the Code must not be confused with the ‘common intention’ under section 34 of the Code.”
67        The Court further held on the issue of one or members of the unlawful assembly being armed with a deadly weapon even though an accused person was not armed with a deadly weapon, the fact that the others were armed would nevertheless render him liable for the aggravated offence of rioting under section 148. The Court stated –
“The next issue for me was whether credible evidence has been produced by the prosecution that any of the assailants had been armed with ‘deadly weapons’ at the material time. A ‘deadly weapon’ as shown in section 144 of the Penal Code, is anything, which used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death. In this case there was no evidence that the appellant himself was armed with any deadly weapon. However, by virtue of section 149 of the Penal Code, he would nevertheless be liable under section 148 of the Penal Code for the aggravated offence of rioting armed with a deadly weapon, so long as one member of that assembly was so armed.
68        From the evidence adduced by the prosecution, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved all the accused persons were members of an unlawful assembly and that some members of that assembly were armed with deadly weapons, namely a chopper, wooden poles, knife and an ice-pick.
Criminal Intimidation
69        As regards the offence of criminal intimidation under section 506 preferred against the fourth accused the Court considered the decision in 
Ramanathan Yogendran v PP 
[1995] 2 SLR 563
.
 In that case the Hon Chief Justice stated -
“In 
Ramanathan Yogendran v PP 
[1995] 2 SLR 563
, I stated that in considering whether the substantive offence of criminal intimidation has been established, it should be shown that the victim had some objective basis to apprehend alarm, even if she was never alarmed…”
70        Marc Christopher Oliveiro testified that on the night in question when the fight erupted between two groups of people near his car, he waited for an opportune time to safely go to it and move it because he was afraid that it might be damaged. When he saw the fight progressing towards Sunshine Plaza, he went over to his car to start it. As he was doing so, the fourth accused came up to him while he was seated in his car, and grabbed his shirt and wielded a chopper intending to strike him with it. As the fourth accused was very close to him he noticed that the fourth accused smelt of alcohol. Upon seeing the chopper Marc Oliveiro immediately pushed open his car door and fled from the scene. He ran towards Park Lane shopping mall at Selegie Road. When he realised that the fourth accused was not chasing him he turned back and proceeded back to Mr Bean Café.
71        With regard to the charge of criminal intimidation, I was satisfied that that the prosecution had proved a prima facie case against the fourth accused on the charge and called upon him for his defence to the charge. 
Disorderly Behaviour
72        As regards the charge of disorderly behaviour under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act against the third accused it was noted that disorderly behaviour is not defined in the said Act. However, in 
Pritam Singh v Public Prosecutor
[6]
 
the learned Senior District Judge in deciding what would constitute disorderly behaviour referred to several cases in Scotland and New Zealand that had provisions similar to section 20 of Miscellaneous Offences Act that interpreted the phrase. The Court accepted the proposition that disorderly behaviour was a matter of degree depending on the time, place and circumstances. Less aggressive conduct than would be required to constitute a breach of peace would be sufficient to constitute disorderly behaviour.  It would be sufficient if the accused’s conduct was aggressive, even after warnings and advice were given. To behave in a disorderly manner is to act in a manner, which contravenes good conduct or proper conduct. The learned SDJ stated –
This expression has however been the subject of judicial interpretation in other jurisdictions.
In the Scottish High Court of Justiciary case of
CAMPBELL v ADAIR [1945] S.C. (J) 29,
 section 35(5) ofthe 
GLASGOW POLICE ACT 1866
 was before the court. This section made it an offence if a person was ""riotous, disorderly or indecent"" in his behaviour, a provision not too dissimilar from section 20 of the Singapore Act. Lord Moncrieff said at page 33:
""The question... must accordingly depend on what interpretation is put upon the word `disorderly' in the statutory enactment. It is a word of very wide comprehension. It is, I think, a word which indicates less aggressive conduct than would be required to constitute a breach of the peace; and I thought that the learned Lord Advocate was right in saying that, unless the conduct required fell short of such conduct, there would be no need for a statutory enactment. The question is not whether the conduct of the appellant provoked disorder by leading to disorderly action on the part of others who were present and witnessed his conduct. The question is whether he himself acted in a manner which can be described as disorderly.""
The Court accepted the proposition that less aggressive conduct than would be required to constitute a breach of peace would be sufficient to constitute disorderly behaviour. It was therefore immaterial whether the crowd gathered because of the Accused's behaviour or because of a fight. As stated above, theconduct of the Accused was aggressive, a fortiori after warnings and advice by PW1 and PW2.
In New Zealand, the Supreme Court held in 
WAINWRIGHT v POLICE
 
[1968] NZLR 101
, that what was disorderly behaviour was a matter of degree, depending on the circumstance of the case. Wild CJ at page 103 said:
""Disorderly behaviour was explained by the Court of Appeal in 
MESLER V POLICE 
[1967] NZLR 437
 by the use of various expressions in the three judgments. I apply these without restating or adding to them, and take as a guiding principle the opinion of Turner J (ibid pp 444-5) that judgment of the conduct in question is in every case a matter of degree depending upon the relevant time, place, and circumstances. With that I, respectfully agree. Conduct that is acceptable at a football match or boxing may well be disorderly at a musical or dramatic performance. Behaviour that is permissible at a political meeting may deeply offend at a religious gathering.""
The Court accepted this proposition. The place of the offence was a hawker centre. The time was at 9.30pm, when there were still a crowd. It was surely not permissible conduct, in such a public place and at such a time, for the Accused to shout at the top of his voice and gesticulate. The Accused continued to shout and gesticulate even though the police officers came onto the scene.
In the case cited by Defence Counsel, 
POLICE v CHRISTIE,
 disorderly behaviour was defined as follows:
""Disorderly is the antonym of `orderly’, which means  regular, obedient or discipline, not unruly, or well-behaved. In 
BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY
 
4th edition 556
,`disorderly' is defined as being contrary to the rulesof good order and behaviour. It, of course, has otherconnotations to which I shall refer in a moment. ""To behave"" means to act or conduct oneself with propriety, and it will be remembered that the word `behave' is a part of the section. To behave in a disorderly manner is, accordingly, to act in a manner which contravenes good conduct or proper conduct.""
 
The Court also accepted this proposition…..
It was also held in 
POLICE v CHRISTIE
 that to support a charge of disorderly behaviour under section 3D of the Police Offences Act 1927 - a provision not too dissimilar from the said Singapore section 20 -it was not necessary to show that the conduct of the accused was such as to provoke a breach of the peace or to be calculated to do so. The Defence did not contend that such breach of peace was an ingredient of disorderly behaviour. It was also not the Prosecution case that there was such a breach of the peace. To be sure, the Court was aware of the case of 
PP v THORBURN (1949) 15 MLJ 282.
 This case involved section 6(c) of the Emergency Regulations 1948. The accused was charged for behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm from which he fired several shots in the air. The Court adopted the 4th definition of Webster for the meaning of ""disorderly"": namely ""offensive to good morals and public decency; notoriously offensive"" as to what was intended to be the offence aimed at by section 6(c) Emergency Regulations 1948. The Court in the instant case did not adopt this definition. The purpose and circumstances of the Emergency Regulations were vastly different from the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act.
73        Applying the above principles, as regards the charge of disorderly behaviour under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) preferred against the third accused, Sgt Quah had testified that the third accused was rude, shouting loudly and gesticulating with his hands. He was annoyed and aggressive. The third accused was warned several times to behave himself but he chose to ignore the warnings. On the testimony of Sgt Quah I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved a prima facie case of disorderly behaviour against the third accused and accordingly called upon him for his defence to this charge.
74        With regards to the charge of rioting with a deadly weapon, the Court was satisfied that there was some evidence that all the accused persons were members of an unlawful assembly with the common object to commit affray. The group numbered approximately twenty people. Some of whom were armed with deadly weapons. They had participated in an argument that erupted into a fight.  Accordingly, the court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved a prima facie case against all the accused on the rioting charges.
75        Thereafter, all accused were called upon for their defence to the charges. All the accused elected to give evidence from the witness box in respect of their charges.
Defences
First Accused
76        In brief, the first accused denied committing the offence of rioting. He claimed that on 19 October 2001, between 8.30p.m and 8.45p.m he went to the Singapore Indian Association at Balestier Road. As the club has a dress code he wore a turquoise long sleeved shirt and a pair of black trousers. Between 10.30p.m and 11.00p.m he met and signed in the third accused as a guest. On 20 October 2001, at about 1.30a.m the two of them left the Association and proceeded to Jalan Berseh Food centre. The two of them remained there till 3.45a.m before they decided to proceed to Mad Dogs pub at Orchard Towers for a drink. The third accused whilst driving the first accused’s car suggested that they proceed to Mohican’s pub at Prinsep Street for a drink. The first accused agreed and they proceeded to make their way there. The first accused had been to Mohican’s pub before and had attended its opening ceremony. He knew that Mohan s/o Ranjangam and Rajendran were the other owners of the pub. The first accused stated that he regarded Mohican’s pub as a family pub because the fifth accused, his nephew and the eighth accused, his brother-in-law were running it. He would patronise it two to three times in a week.
77        The first accused stated that from Middle Road, the third accused drove the first car into Prinsep Street past Mohican’s pub. Upon entering Prinsep Street, the first accused noticed that there were vehicles parked on either side of the road leaving sufficient space for one vehicle to pass through. There was a vehicle ahead of them, which was proceeding slowly as there was human traffic along the road. He stated that there were people running in between the cars. The first accused also stated that he sensed that something was wrong but they did not stop the car to find out. The first accused stated that he had a phobia about fights and could not bear to witness people fighting. The first accused stated that it took them ten to fifteen minutes to drive along Prinsep Street, past Mohican’s pub, negotiate the roundabout at the top of the road, pass Mr Bean Café and proceed towards the junction of Middle Road. During this time, neither he nor the third accused stopped or got out of the car.
78        While they approached the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road, the first accused stated that he saw the eighth accused’s car on the left side of the road behind a police vehicle. The third accused stopped the vehicle behind the eighth accused’s car and alighted. At that time, the eighth accused was talking to a police officer. At that juncture another police officer approached the third accused to speak to him. When the police officer called out to the fourth accused who was walking towards them to draw his attention the first accused stated that he noticed the fourth accused. The first accused stated that the manner in which the officer called out to the fourth accused was disrespectful. The third accused then told the police officer that he was rude and that his conduct was totally unbecoming of a police officer. The police officer then demanded for the third accused’s personal particulars. Apparently, the officer felt that the third accused should not have questioned the way he called the fourth accused. The third accused then took out his wallet and identified himself as a serving civil servant attached to the Customs Department. After an exchange of words between them, the accused was informed that he was being arrested for disorderly behaviour. When the first accused also informed the police officer that what the third had said was not wrong he was told not to interfere. The first accused stated that the third accused did not shout loudly at the police officer nor did he gesticulate with his hands as alleged.
79        The first accused stated that he was not arrested at the scene. After the third accused was arrested he took off his shirt and changed to a T- shirt. Thereafter, he proceeded to Mohican’s pub where he met Insp. Sajad and informed him of what had happened Whilst at Mohican’s pub he saw the fifth accused, Mohan s/o Ranjangam and police officers there. Subsequently, in compliance with instructions from investigating officer Ramesh he drove his car to Beach Road police station and left it there for investigations. The eight accused’s car, SCM 91 too, was driven to Beach Road police station and seized for police investigations. It was the fifth accused who drove the car to the police station. As the eighth accused had been arrested, he and the fifth accused proceeded to Central Police Division to assist the third and eighth accused. Whilst at Central Police Division, he and the fifth accused were detained on investigating officer Jahir Hussain’s instructions.
80        The first accused stated too, that on the day of the incident the boot of his car was jammed shut. It could not be opened which explained why the car’s cross spanner, jack and other items were placed at the rear floor board of the car as shown in the photographs P27 to P29.
Second Accused
81        In his defence the second accused too denied committing the offence of rioting.  He denied that he was at Prinsep Street on 20 October 2001 pointing here and there or that he was orchestrating the fight. He claimed that (PW14) Kelvin Goh Joo Kwan mistook him for someone else.
82        The second accused stated that eighth accused was a childhood friend whom he was close to like a brother. He stated that he regularly met the accused at the eighth accused’s office. On the occasions he went there he saw the fourth and sixth accused. The seventh accused worked for the eighth accused. As for the first and third accused he had seen them together on the one or two occasions when he was at Mohican’s pub. He was not aware of any business dispute between the fifth accused and Mohan s/o Ranjangam.
83        On 19 October 2001, at about 9.30p.m he went to Jalan Berseh food centre. There he met the eighth accused at the upper floor of the centre. With them were the sixth and seventh accused. Whilst there the group were there till 3.15a.m the following morning, they had consumed two bottles of dry gin and ten bottles of beer between them. The second accused was tipsy and so was the seventh accused. The second accused accepted the eighth accused usual offer to drop him along the expressway half way to his home. The second, sixth and seventh accused then boarded the eighth accused’s car. Along the way when the second accused noticed that the eighth accused was taking a different route , he inquired where the eighth accused was taking them. The eighth accused told him that he wanted to see the fifth accused and proceeded to Prinsep Street.
84        Upon turning right into Prinsep Street from Prinsep Link, the accused stopped the car at the junction on the left hand side of the road. After getting out of the car the eighth accused approached the fifth accused who was standing approximately 6.8 metres away along the road.
85        Meanwhile, the second accused got out of the car and smoked a cigarette. Approximately five minutes later, the eighth accused returned to the car after telling the fifth accused to go home. Thereafter, the eighth accused drove off with the second accused, sixth and seventh accused towards the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. When the car reached the said junction a policeman stopped the vehicle and demanded all of them to produce their identity cards to him, which they did.
86        After being allowed to leave, the eighth accused drove on. Whilst driving they were stopped a second time. The police officer requested for the eighth accused’s identity card. The second accused got out of the car and began walking towards the traffic light at Middle Road. When he saw the fifth accused there, he inquired of the fifth accused why the police had stopped the eighth accused’s car a second time. The fifth accused told him that he did not know the reason. Whilst there, the second accused stated that he noticed a police officer with a Chinese person and an Indian person. The Chinese person was pointing at certain places. They walked towards the place where the eighth accused has stopped his car. The police officer approached him and told him to proceed to a patrol car at the Elections Department and to wait beside it. He did as he was instructed.
87        Subsequently, he was taken to Cantonment Complex. In the patrol car he saw the third accused. The third accused was handcuffed. The second accused said he was told to give a statement and thereafter would be released. He was not arrested. At Cantonment Complex he was placed in the lockup. Later he gave a statement.
88        With regard to (PW17) Yeo Kiat Liang’s testimony that the second accused looked familiar to him, the second accused stated that that could be due to the fact that he could have seen him ten to fifteen years ago at Stirling Road where he had previously lived.
Third Accused
89        The third accused, a Higher Immigration Checkpoint specialist with Singapore Customs, stated that he knew the first accused for five to six years prior to the commission of the alleged offence. As for second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused, they were mere acquaintances whom he had seen at Mohican’s pub. As for the fifth accused he knew that the fifth accused supplied labour.
90        On 19 October 2001 after 10.30p.m he went to Indian Association and met the first accused there. He stayed at Indian Association till past midnight before proceeding to Jalan Berseh Food Centre in the first accused’s car. As the first accused was tired he drove the first accused’s car. At Jalan Berseh Food Centre they sat at the first floor. They had something to eat and whilst there he translated some Tamil songs into English for the first accused. While there they did not see any of the other accused persons. They were there at the food centre for more than an hour before they decided to leave.
91        After leaving the food centre the both of them decided to proceed to Mad Dogs pub at Orchard Towers but along the way the third accused suggested that they proceed to Mohican’s pub at Prinsep Street. He had been there three or four times before. Upon entering Prinsep Street via Middle Road he noticed human movement in the area. There were cars ahead of him moving slowly and he followed them. There were cars parked on either side of the road and on the centre white line. He did not stop the car and continued driving, negotiating the roundabout at the end of the road and proceeded back along Prinsep Street to the junction of Middle Road. Nearing the said junction he stopped the car when police officers beckoned him to do so. After handing over his NRIC to the police officers to record. At this juncture, he saw the fourth accused walking towards them. When the police officer rudely called out to the fourth accused he felt that what the police officer had done was improper. He identified himself as a long serving Customs officer and told the police officer that he should address members of the public courteously. He did this out of concern and with good intentions. The police officer misunderstood him and took it personally. The police officer thought that he was challenging his authority and was being rude. The third accused denied being rude or using any wrong words. The officer was possibly annoyed with him and informed him that he was being arrested for disorderly behaviour. He was handcuffed and taken to a police car. 
92        The third accused also denied being informed that he was charged for an offence of rioting with a deadly weapon. He claimed that he was only aware of the charge when he was released on police bail. He denied committing the offences of disorderly behaviour and rioting alleged.

94        On 19 October 2001, after work he went to Jalan Berseh Food Centre and might have been with the sixth and eighth accused. Due to the fact that the incident had happened a long time ago, he was unable to recall whether the first accused, second accused, third accused were also at the hawker centre. He was unsure whether the sixth and seventh accused were there. He stated that he had many friends who drank at the hawker centre and moved from table to table to drink with them. He had a lot to drink and could not remember what time he left the hawker centre. Thereafter, he may have gone to the Desker Road area. He did not know how he reached Prinsep Street and could only recall being stopped by a police officer which sobered him up a little. He was then arrested, placed in a police car and taken to Cantonment complex. He was not informed the reason for his arrest. Later the same day, he volunteered a statement in accordance with the provisions of section 121 of the CPC before being released on bail. He also volunteered two statements that were recorded from him in accordance with section 122(6) of the CPC. He vehemently denied committing the offence of rioting alleged against him. He also denied being armed with a chopper and intimidating Marc Oliveiro with it.

Between the three of them, who were friends, it was mutually agreed that Rajendran would be in charge of the accounts, Mohan in charge of security and the fifth accused was to be in charge of operations and staffing.
97        On or about 14 September 2001 when Mohican’s pub commenced business, they had no problems between them. However, between then till 20 October 2001, the fifth accused stated that he and Rajendran had differences because of several incidents that happened. He began to disbelieve what Mohan told him. Firstly, when Mohan failed to report to the police an instance of an attempted extortion by Vengadeswaran Gobi and Daniel Vijay. Secondly, when Mohan told the fifth accused to throw away a sachet of vegetable matter believed to be controlled drugs discovered on the pub’s premises. The fifth accused surrendered the drugs to the police and subsequently lodged a police report to that effect. 
98        In October 2001, the fifth accused stated that though there was some talk of him withdrawing from the partnership it was not confirmed. Prior to 19 October 2001, the fifth accused stated that Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam informed him that there had been an attempt by some people to extort protection money from the pub. At the time of the incident he was overseas. Rajendran said that when he informed Mohan about the incident, Mohan said that he would handle it. When Rajendran informed him of the incident, the fifth accused advised Rajendran that a police report should be lodged.  However, Mohan told them that that was not necessary since those people were always in the vicinity of Prinsep Street.
99        On 19 October 2001, just before midnight he attended the grand opening of Celebrations Pub & Music Lounge at Bukit Pasoh Road. He went with his friends namely, Jarina Banu, Vijay, Don and Rosita.

The fifth accused stated that he could not recall whether he had gone elsewhere before proceeding to Prinsep Street. At about 4.00a.m he arrived at Prinsep Street. He had a reason for going to Mohican’s pub because that night he had received a number of telephone calls from friends who wanted to know if he was going there. The fifth accused said that some of them made calls to him in order to induce him to go to the pub. He said he couldn’t identify the pranksters because he was in a noisy environment. That night he received a number of calls stating that there was trouble at the pub. That night he said that he called the eighth accused to him to attend the opening ceremony at Celebrations Pub & Music Lounge and also informed him of the crank calls he received. The eighth accused told him that if he was in the vicinity he would go down to Mohican’s and check the place out. The eighth accused did not tell him where he was then.
101      Upon entering Prinsep Street, the fifth accused stated that as there was no available parking, he parked his car opposite No 66 Prinsep Street, Mackenzie Rex Restaurant in the direction of Selegie Road. In front of his car, there was a police car. When he walked to towards Insp. Sajad Hussain Shah and the pub he saw, Mohan, Rajendran and Selvarajoo s/p Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appo Rajah. At the time Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appo Rajah was in the process of locking up the pub. When he asked Insp Sajad what had happened he was informed that there were complaints of a commotion at the pub so Insp Sajad advised Selvarajoo s/p Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appo Rajah to lock up the pub early. After the pub was locked and whist walking back to his car, Mohan s/o Ranjangam approached him hurling vulgarities. This occurred opposite No 66 Prinsep Street. By then Insp Sajad had left the scene. According to the fifith accused, Mohan alleged that the fifth accused had cut down his patronage at the pub resulting in dwindling business. Mohan also accused him of discouraging customers to come to the pub. The fifth accused said he ignored Mohan because he often did this when drunk and usually apologised the next day for his actions. According to the fifth accused, at that time the pub was doing well and he had expressed no intention to sell his shares in the pub. He denied telling Mohan that he had cheated the pub. He also stated that Jarina Banu did not intervene during this argument. Neither was the sixth accused present during the argument. He did not say anything and left. He said that when Rajendran, Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appo Rajah and Hussein pulled Mohan away he continued walking to his car. Whilst walking to his car he bumped into one or two people. Whilst there, the fifth accused stated that he did not see any of the other accused persons there. When he reached his car he got into it. Whilst reversing his car he saw a small scuffle outside “Roomful of Blues” pub at No 72 Prinsep Street. By then patrons from the row of pubs along Prinsep Street were leaving the pubs. He then drove past Mr Bean Café to find a parking lot. When he glanced over his shoulder he saw more and more people joining in the scuffle which was between Nos. 72 and 74 Prinsep Street.  He saw about ten to fifteen people in the group. He did not notice whether they had wooden poles. He noticed that some of them wore bright coloured clothes. The fifth accused stated that he found a parking lot when he reached the junction of Prinsep Street and Prinsep Link opposite the Elections Department. As he was parking his car he heard a loud crash. He heard loud voices shouting and there was a lot of human traffic. He saw a group of dark skinned boys running past his car.
102      After parking his car he saw the eighth accused’s car along Prinsep Link. The eighth accused’s car turned right into Prinsep Street and drew abreast of his car. The fifth accused got out of his car and spoke to the eighth accused who inquired why he was there at that hour. The fifth accused said that he had come to check on the pub. He also told the eighth accused about the incident with Mohan and the police officers. The fifth accused stated that he did not know who were in the eighth accused’s car but presumed they were the eighth accused’s friends. The eighth accused told him to leave the place immediately. Thereafter, the eighth accused’s friends got into the car to leave Prinsep Street. The fifth accused waited for the eighth accused to drive off before driving off himself. Whilst there he said he saw the second accused who waved to him and lit a cigarette.
103      Shortly, as he was coming out of the parking lot he saw the police stopping the eighth accused’s car. Leaving his car where it was parked, he asked Jarina Banu who was with him to wait for him outside the car before proceeding to walk ahead to the eighth accused’s car to inquire what was going on. The police officers were asking for the eighth accused’s identity card and checking on the occupants in the eighth accused’s car. He noticed that the only the eighth accused had alighted from the car. When he asked the officers why they had stopped the eighth accused’s car, he was told that there had been a fight at Prinsep Street and that it was routine procedure to take down the particulars of the cars leaving Prinsep Street. The police also stopped the first accused’s car, which was behind the eighth accused’s car. He did not notice who were the occupants in the first accused’s car. Whilst at the scene the fifth accused said he told the police officers that they were the ones who called the police. In fact he had told Jarina Banu to call the police, which she did. Thereafter, he gave the officers his NRIC and name card. Subsequently, the eighth accused drove off and was stopped again near the Presbyterian Church further along Prinsep Street. After the eighth accused had left he saw the first accused arguing with a police officer. He said that initially the first accused was wearing a dark blue long sleeved shirt but later changed into a white T-shirt just before the police photographer took photographs of the scene. He also stated that did not see the third accused there. He stated that he only saw the second, sixth, seventh accused when they got out of the eighth accused’s car that was stopped by the police, a second time. After the eighth accused was arrested the second accused spoke to him.
104      The fifth accused said that at the scene he assisted in police investigations. Whilst walking back towards Mohicans pub he saw two police cars. In one car he saw the third accused and in the other he saw the fourth accused. He was shocked to see them. That was the first time he saw the both of them. When he was asked to open Mohican’s pub for investigations, he called Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam.
105      Consequently, the fifth accused spoke to Insp Sajad when he came to the scene and inquired what had happened. Whilst at the scene Rajendran told the officers in the presence of Mohan s/o Ranjangam and Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appo Rajah that a group of Malaysians dressed in brightly coloured clothes could have damaged the pub.
106      Both the first and eighth accused’s cars were detained for police investigations. Later, the fifth accused accompanied by a police officer drove the eighth accused’s car to Beach Road Station. The first accused also drove his car to the said police station. After that the police took him and the first accused to Cantonment Complex. There they were arrested. Thereafter he was released on police bail which subsequently lapsed.
107      In January 2003, during police investigations he was never asked whether he was involved in rioting or was a member of an unlawful assembly. Only during the recording of his police statement Investigating Officer Jahir Hussain told him that five or six weapons were seized and that as his father was involved he should own up so that things would go smoothly for him.

However, the fourth accused said he was with the group drinking with them till 3.00a.m. As for the second, sixth and seventh accused they stated that they were drunk, having consumed a large amount of alcohol. The eighth accused agreed to give them a lift home in his car. The second, sixth and the seventh accused all clearly stated that the fourth accused was not with them in the eighth accused’s car that night.
119      As far as the fourth accused was concerned, he was too drunk to remember how he got to Prinsep Street. He was unsure whether he was drinking with the second, sixth, seventh and eighth accused at Jalan Berseh Food Centre earlier that night as he had many friends that he usually drank with at the said food centre. He only remembered where he was when he was called by a police officer. Apparently that sobered him up a little. He denied committing the offence of criminal intimidation and participating in the riot.
120      Consequently, the eighth accused claimed that in response to a telephone call from the fifth accused, he informed the latter that he would check on the pub if time permitted. Whilst driving along Bencoolen Street he remembered the fifth accused’s suggestion to check on the pub. He made a sudden right turn from Bencoolen Street into Prinsep Link proceeding to Prinsep Street. As he did so he noticed the fifth accused ahead at the junction. He turned right into Prinsep Street and stopped immediately by the left-hand side of the road beside the fifth accused’s car to speak to him. They both got out their cars and spoke to each other whilst the second accused smoked a cigarette nearby. After the conversation the eighth, second, sixth and seventh accused drove on to the junction of Middle Road. On approaching the said junction the eighth accused’s car was stopped. After their personal particulars were recorded they proceeded on.  As the car past the junction, the eighth accused’s car was again stopped by police officers who this time not only asked for their personal particulars but requested all of them to come of the vehicle to enable a search of the vehicle. In the course of the search of the eighth accused’s car, an ice pick was recovered. Thereafter, the eighth accused was arrested. Later, at Cantonment police complex the remaining accused persons were arrested.
121      As regards the apparent joint defences of the first and third accused, the both of them stated that they proceeded in the first accused’s car to Prinsep Street from Jalan Berseh Food Centre. At the time the third accused was driving the first accused’s car. They intended to go to Mohican’s pub but sensing that something was amiss because there was a lot of “human traffic” they decided to leave the area by way of Middle Road. They both denied participating in any armed riot. They both said as they approached the said junction, they saw the eighth accused outside his car speaking to police officers. They stopped behind the car to enquire what was going on. While speaking to police officers the third accused saw the fourth accused walking along Prinsep Street. Offended at the way a police officer called out to draw the fourth accused’s attention, the third accused admittedly pointed out to the police officer that the manner in which he called out to the fourth accused was impolite. Both the first accused and third accused denied being aggressive or disorderly when they spoke to Sgt Quah. Howeverm the incident resulted in the third accused being arrested for disorderly behaviour.
122      In assessing the defences of all the accused persons it was clear to the Court that the main issue in the case pertained to the identification of all the accused being the scene of the fight and whether all of them were members of an unlawful assembly.
123      The other areas to be determined was whether the third accused had behaved in a disorderly manner and whether the fourth accused had intimidated Marc Oliveiro with a chopper. The Court noted that the time of the incident was at 4.00 a.m. in the morning along a stretch of Prinsep Street occupied by pubs and restaurants. At the time some pub and restaurants were closed and others were in the process of closing. There were normal streetlights on either side of Prinsep Steet and there was ambient light from Mr Bean Café and some pubs opposite. The area was sufficiently well lighted.
124      The scene of the fight was on Prinsep Street between Mr Bean Café on one side and Mohican’s pub on the other. Prinsep Street is a normal 2-way road with a roundabout and a side road that leads from Selegie Road into Prinsep Street. At the other end of the road Prinsep Street meets Middle Road at a cross-junction. Before the junction, Prinsep Link joins Prinsep Street leading to Bencoolen Street.
125      Bearing in mind that the defence contended that that prosecution witnesses had mistakenly identified the accused to be the persons involved in committing the offence/s the court was mindful of the Honourable Chief Justice’s decision on identification evidence in 
Govindaraj Perulasamy & Others v PP
[7]
 
. The Hon Chief Justice stated:
“The law on identification evidence was laid down in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
. In that case, the Court of Appeal adopted laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1997] QB 224
 into a 3- step test as follows:
(a)      the first question that a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case concerning identification evidence is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the Defence to be unreliable.
(b)      
If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made?
(c)      
Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor the judge should go into the third question. Is there any other evidence that goes to support the correctness of the identification?
(d)      
As to the 2
nd
 question, the Court of Appeal suggested a non exhaustive list of factors and circumstances that should be considered in assessing whether the identification evidence was of good quality. These included:
(a)      
the length of time the witness observed the accused;
(b)      
the distance at which the observation was made;
(c)      
the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation;
(d)      
the number of times the witness saw the accused;
(e)      
the frequency at which the witness saw the accused;
(f)      
the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused;
(g)      
the length of time which elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police; and
(h)      
the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused.
At the third stage of the test, if the judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification, he should be mindful that a conviction based on poor identification would be unsafe.”
With regards to an assembly of persons at the scene of the fight, the Court was also mindful of the Hon Chief Justice’s observations in 
Osman Bin Ramli v PP
[8]
that :
“It is settled law that a mere presence in an assembly of persons did not make the accused a member of an unlawful assembly, unless there was direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared the common object of the assembly. 
In my opinion, however, a person present at the assembly can be said to be a member of the assembly even if no overt act is proved against him. Provided the circumstances are such as to justify an inference that he associated himself with the offending members, it may be inferred that he was a member of such an assembly.
 In every case this question is one of fact as to whether he happens to be innocently present at the place of the occurrence or was actually a member of the unlawful assembly: see 
Bishambar v State of Bihar
[9]
 
[Emphasis added]
Continuing the Hon Chief Justice stated:
“Therefore, mere passive presence in an unlawful assembly 
may
 or
may not
 constitute membership of that assembly: it depends on whether in all the circumstances of the case the court can draw the inference even from the a person’s mere presence that he shared the common object of that assembly. There is no rigid rule that mere presence can never constitute membership of an unlawful assembly. Similarly, 
there is no requirement that a member of an unlawful assembly must be an ‘active participant’ or that some ‘overt act’ must be proven against him”
On the facts of the present case, a group of 15-20 males walked towards and surrounded four geatly outnumbered victims in a public park at 4.00 a.m. in the morning. One person within the group repeatedly asked Sunny threatening questions about which secret society he belonged to. Someone then smashed a glass bottle and a fight broke soon thereafter. In such circumstances, it would have been clear to the appellant that the common object of the assembly was to cause hurt to others, at least from the point when threatening questions were asked. If he chose to continue to remain present in the assembly beyond that point, the inference would be irresistible that he shared the common object of that assembly unless he could convicnce the court that he had some special reason for doing so. However, no such reason was tendered. Although the entire event happened in a matter of minutes, there was still sufficient time for the appellant to dissociate him self from the group if he wanted to do so. “
126      With the above principles in mind the Court considered the evidence and the defences of each accused.
The first accused
127      In assessing the first accused’s evidence it was concluded that he was an untruthful and evasive witness. He stated that he went to Jalan Berseh Food Centre only with the third accused for supper and only the two of them were together. However, I disbelieved that the first and third accused were alone at the food centre. The second accused in his statement (P49) said that he saw the third accused with several other people at the food centre. Though the second accused did not mention that the first accused was there the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn was that the third accused must have been with the first accused since the first accused maintained that he was at all times with the third accused. Furthermore, the
 
fourth accused in his statement (P53) stated that the first and third accused had joined him and the second, sixth, seventh and eighth accused at Jalan Berseh Food Centre for drinks. On this evidence, the only irresistible conclusion to be drawn is that all the accused must have been drinking together at Jalan Berseh Food Centre.  Furthermore, they were known to each other and there was no reason for them to be seated apart in the saw hawker centre.  The fact that the first and third accused distanced themselves from the second, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused could only mean that it was with a view to negative the fact that they were together and had gone to Prinsep Street together on receipt of the fifth accused’s telephone call.
128      Consequently, the group must have proceeded to Prinsep Street in their respective cars that were Mercedes Benzes. It was not disputed that the first accused was the owner of a Mercedes Benz bearing registration number, ET 6250 R.  It was also not disputed that the fifth accused was the registered owner of Mercedes Benz bearing registration number SCA 966 L and the eighth accused was the registered owner of Mercedes Benz bearing registration number SCM 91 H. It was not disputed that all three cars were at the scene at the time of the riot. Sgt Peh, Goh Joo Kuan, Daniel Vijay and Vengadeswaran Gobi all testified that they saw the first accused alight from a Mercedes Benz motorcar. Sgt Ameer upon his arrival at Prinsep Street only stopped the first and eighth accused’s cars because he received information from members of the public that the people involved in the fight were leaving in a Mercedes Benz car.   Daniel Vijay too, stated that he saw four vehicles stop along Prinsep Street. One of the cars that stopped was the first accused’s car. He clearly saw the first accused opening the boot of the car. At the time the fifth accused was standing near him. I believed this evidence as there was no reason for Daniel Vijay and Vengadeswaran Gobi to fabricate this evidence.
129      Rajendran also testified that on 20 October 2001between 12.30a.m to 1.00a.m, the first accused came to the pub with the third and the sixth accused. When they were turned away at the gate because they requested to be served drinks, the first accused was heard to loudly remark that he should recognise the pub’s regular customers. I believed Rajendran’s testimony that the first accused, third accused and the sixth accused went to Mohican’s pub at that hour to request for a drink. There is no reason for Rajendran to fabricate this evidence. The first accused was known to Rajendran and was positively identified by a person who was known to him and had dealings with. In fact, the first accused too admitted that Rajendran’s testimony had not harmed him and did not think that Rajendran had said anything that was untrue against him.
130      The first accused contention that he did not drive his car that night and that the third accused and that the boot of the car was jammed was also disbelieved. Vengadeswaran Gobi and Daniel Vijay both testified that they saw the first accused alight from the driver’s side of his vehicle ET 6250 and speak to the fifth accused. The boot of the car was opened then. I also disbelieved the first accused’s evidence that he changed from his Turquoise shirt into a white T-shirt after the police stopped him because he was seen by Sgt Peh wearing a white round necked T-shirt. At the scene, Sgt Yeo too, noticed that the accused was attired in a white shirt and not a Turquoise shirt.
131      Three to four other persons were also seen alighting from the first accused car. Thereafter, he saw the first accused open the boot of his car and take out a knife.  It is clear that the first accused claim that he was not the driver was an attempt to discredit the testimony of Vengadeswaran Gobi and Daniel Vijay. Goh Joo Kuan too, testified that he saw ET 6250 R stopping along Prinsep Street outside Mr Bean Café. He too saw several persons alighting from the car. He saw the boot of the car being opened and something being taken out of it before the group walked towards Mohican’s pub. Both Sgts Peh and Yeo also said that they saw the first accused alighting from a blue Mercedes Benz after it had stopped and began shouting at a group of persons. This crucial evidence was denied by the first accused who maintained that the car did not stop at all throughout its journey past Mohican’s pub, Mr Bean Café till the time it stopped behind the eighth accused’s car near the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. On the evidence I disbelieved the first accused defence that he had gone to Prinsep Street that night only with the third accused and that the boot of his car was jammed and couldn’t be opened. Other than his claims, the first accused provided no evidence that the boot of the car was jammed that night. On the contrary, the first accused admitted that it could be opened and had offered his car key to a police officer to open it.
132      Furthermore, I disbelieved the first accused contention that he was with the third accused in the car throughout till his arrest because Sgt Yeo testified that he clearly saw the fifth accused arguing with the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused. He was observing them for approximately five minutes. Therefore, the first accused’s claim that he was throughout with the third accused all the while in the car cannot be true. If the first accused and the third accused were admittedly together it must have been at the time when they were leaving Prinsep Street after the fight. Accordingly, on the evidence it was apparent that the first accused had gone to Prinsep Street that night with the third accused and others and had engaged in a fight together with the other accused persons. A knife, in the first accused’s car, was brought to the scene. It was taken out from the boot of his car. The first accused was, therefore, aware that those persons involved in the argument and subsequent fight were armed. He must have also known that the third accused was involved in a fight there because Goh Joo Kuan testified that he saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused fighting. Goh Joo Kuan also testified that the third accused had threatened him and customers at Mr Bean café with a knife. During the fight, the first accused was seen by Sgt Peh climbing over the wall into Mohican’s pub and throwing a chair at the glass panel. Sgt Yeo said that he saw the first accused throw a beer barrel at the glass panel shattering it and also smashing the gate posts lights of the pub.
133      On the totality of the evidence, I disbelieved the first accused’s defence that he was not involved in the armed riot. Accordingly he was found guilty and convicted on the said charge.
The second accused
134      In essence the second accused’s defence was a denial. He claimed that he was not at the scene at the time of the alleged offence. After the police had stopped the eighth accused’s car he was told that he was being taken to the police station for a statement to be recorded after which he would be released. When he reached the car he saw the third accused handcuffed and seated in the car. Later, at Central Police Division he was handcuffed and placed in the lockup. He was not told that he was arrested. When a statement (P49) was recorded he gave it voluntarily. In denying the commission of the offence, he stated that Goh Joo Kuan was mistaken in identifying him to be orchestrating the fight at Prinsep Street. At all times he was in the company of the sixth, seventh and eighth accused whom he had been drinking with from 9.30p.m (19 October 2001) till 3.15a.m (20 October 2001). Whilst at the food centre he did not see any of the other accused persons there.
135      I disbelieved the second accused’s evidence. Though the second accused maintained that he did not see the first, third, fourth, fifth accused at the hawker centre, in his voluntary statement (P49), he said that he saw the third accused at the hawker centre with several other persons. When cross-examined whether he had made that statement to the recording officer he denied that he said it. He also stated that he did not see the fourth accused that night. However, the fourth accused testified that he could only recall drinking with the eighth accused and possibly the sixth and seventh accused at Jalan Berseh Food Centre. However, in his voluntary statement (P53), the fourth accused stated that he was at Jalan Berseh Food Centre drinking beer with the second, sixth, seventh and eighth accused. Later the first and third accused joined them. If that were so then the fourth accused must have been drinking with the second accused. However, the sixth and seventh accused stated that the fourth accused only joined them for a while before the second accused arrived. In contrast, the third accused in his statement (P52), in admitting that he went with the first accused to Jalan Berseh Food Centre, denied meeting up and drinking with the second, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused.
136      It appears from the evidence that the entire defence is that there were two groups seated at different locations in the same food centre. If that was so, then there is no reasonable explanation why the fourth accused would lie about drinking with the second accused. Admittedly, the second, sixth, seventh and eighth accused had consumed a lot of alcohol that night. I disbelieved the second accused’s evidence that he was not drinking with the fourth accused at night. I also disbelieved his evidence that the sixth accused remained at the Food centre till 3.30a.m because Rajendran testified that on 20 October 2001 between 12.30a.m to 1.00a.m, the sixth accused was at Mohican’s pub with the first and third accused and requested for a drink. If that was so, the first, third and sixth accused must have gone to Mohican’s pub together.
137      After their drinks the second accused stated that eighth accused agreed to give him a lift to a usual dropping off point along the expressway where he took a taxi home. After leaving Jalan Berseh Food Centre the second accused stated that only whilst in the car he realised that the eighth accused was not taking the usual route and that they were going to Prinsep Street because the eighth accused wanted to meet the fifth accused. I also disbelieved this evidence because in his statement (P49) he clearly stated after the eighth accused had received a telephone call, the eighth accused told him that the fifth accused was having problems at Mohican’s pub and requested him to go there to see what was happening. The eighth accused in his testimony admitted that whilst at the food centre he received a call from the fifth accused who complained to him that he had received a number of crank calls that night. The eighth accused claimed that he could not recall if he told the second accused the contents of the fifth accused’s call. However, the second accused in his statement (P49) clearly remembered that the eighth accused told him that the fifth accused was having problems at the pub. Thereafter, They all left the food centre.
138      On the evidence, the only reasonable conclusion that could be drawn is that the eighth accused after receiving a call from the fifth accused, must have informed the second accused that the fifth accused was having problems at the pub. The second accused, being the eighth accused’s close friend must have agreed to accompany him to the pub to inquire what was happening. This conversation must have occurred after Vengadeswaran Gobi saw the fifth accused arguing with Mohan outside Mohican’s pub about business matters. After that argument, the fifth accused was seen making a telephone call and overheard speaking to his father.
139      On the evidence, it was apparent that the second accused’s statement differed from his oral testimony in several respects. In his statement (P49) he stated that he saw big crowd gathering on the road between Mohican’s pub and Mr Bean Café. He also said that the fifth accused was then standing alone by the side of Mohican’s pub. The eighth accused drove up to the fifth accused and asked him what had happened. The sixth and seventh accused were standing beside the eighth accused. In evidence he said that the fifth and eighth accused were at the junction of Prinsep Street and Prinsep Link. He made no mention of a big group gathering on the road between Mr Bean Café and Mohican’s pub. He only stated that the sixth and seventh accused were slouched and drunk in the car all the while. If the sixth and seventh accused were slouched in the car at all this must have been after the commission of the offence. Sgt Yeo testified that he saw the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused with the fifth accused outside Mohican’s pub causing a commotion. Daniel Vijay also saw the sixth accused joining an argument between the fifth accused and Mohan s/o Ranjangam. When a fight broke out Goh Joo Kuan saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused fighting. The sixth accused was seen holding a knife and chasing someone. Insofar as the second accused was concerned though Sgt Yeo could not positively identify the second accused to be at the scene he could only say that his face looked familiar. The only person who positively identified the second accused to be at the scene was Goh Joo Kuan. He was seated at a table at Mr Bean Café facing Prinsep Street throughout the incident. Goh Joo Kuan, who heard and saw the incident, clearly saw the second accused at the scene to be pointing here and there or in other words orchestrating the fight. He clearly remembered seeing the second accused after he saw Marc Oliveiro fleeing from his attacker. He said he was shown photographs of all the accused persons during police investigations and he did identify the second accused. He also identified the second accused to police officers at the scene to be pointing here and there. In court he insisted to be shown the photographs of the accused persons that were shown to him during investigations so that he could be absolutely sure in his identification. He said the incident had happened sometime ago and that the accused looks have changed since then. When he was allowed to refer to the photographs he identified the second accused to be at the scene orchestrating the fight.
140      SSSgt Gurucharan Singh stated that though he could not identify the witnesses who identified some of the accused, he did confirm that three male Chinese persons and an Indian person did point out to him some of the accused at the scene. He recalled that the first, fifth and eighth accused were pointed out to him by the witnesses. Sgt Sarwani too, confirmed that Marc Oliveiro identified to him the person who attacked him. At the time, Marc Oliveiro was with Goh Joo Kuan and Wong Chee Hoong.
141      It was the defence that the second accused was at Prinsep Street and in the company of the first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused throughout that night. As the second accused had claimed that he was in the company of the sixth, seventh and eighth accused throughout the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn to the facts is that he must have been with them when the sixth, seventh and eighth accused were seen outside Mohican’s pub having an argument even though he was not identified by any of the prosecution witnesses other that Goh Joo Kuan who saw him at the scene pointing here and there or orchestrating the fight. From the second accused’s actions, presence at the scene of the fight, his close friendship with the eighth accused and his admission that he was with the group that night, the only reasonable inference to be drawn this is that the second accused shared the common object of the unlawful assembly to commit affray. Being with the others who were seen at the scene of the fight and having been in their company he must have known that those in the group were armed with weapons. From his action, the second accused’s clearly played an active part by deed or encouragement in the commission of the offence with the others in the group. If there was a fight, it is clear that the second accused must have shared the common object of the assembly to commit affray. This inference is irresistible unless he could convince the court that he had some special reason for doing so but no such reason was given. Although the incident happened in a matter of minutes there was still time for the second accused to dissociate himself from the group if he wanted to do so but instead he chose to be with them.
142      On all the evidence adduced against the second accused I concluded that the second accused was not a credible and truthful witness. Accordingly, his defence that he was at all times with the sixth, seventh and eighth accused was disbelieved.  He was found guilty and convicted on the said charge.
Third accused
143      The third accused defence was consistent with the first accused’s defence in that they met at the Indian Association after 10.30p.m on 19 October 2001. Sometime after midnight, they proceeded to Jalan Berseh Food Centre. They were seated at the first floor of the food centre. Nobody joined them the two of them while they were there. He did not see any of the other accused persons at the hawker centre. Though he claimed he did not see any of the other accused persons at the food centre, the second accused in his statement said that he saw the third accused there with several other persons. The third accused said that he and the first accused were alone. Furthermore, the fourth accused stated that the first and third accused joined the group and left after awhile. On this point there was clearly a material discrepancy between the third accused’s testimony and that of the second and fourth accused’s evidence.
144      With regard to the charge of disorderly behaviour, the third accused claimed that he was not rude to the police officer and that the police officer could have mistakenly thought that he was challenging the officers’ authority. He also claimed that he spoke nicely to the officer. He was cool and calm and thought that the officer may have misunderstood him. I disbelieved the third accused’s evidence that he was cool and calm as he claimed because the first police officer at the scene, Sgt Mohd Ameer stated that after he had stopped the three cars a group of approximately twelve Indian persons approached him. They were very rowdy and smelt strongly of alcohol. They kept shouting at the top of their voices. Outnumbering Sgt Ameer, the group questioned him why he had stopped him. In the group he saw the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth accused. Sgt Quah said he saw the second, third, sixth and eighth accused in the group making noises and questioning the officers.
145      Consequently, when more police officers arrived at the scene, the group was broken up into smaller clusters. Sgt Quah testified that the third accused shouted at him asking why he had called his friend in a rude manner. Despite Sgt Quah’s attempts at offering an explanation the third accused shouted even louder insisting that he was very rude. The third accused also moved closer blocking his view of the fourth accused who was walking away. The third accused was then arrested after he ignored more than three warnings to lower his voice.
146      Even Sgt Sarwani who was unable to identify the third accused, stated that the male Indian person shouted at Sgt Quah querying why he had to produce his personal particulars. The male Indian person was uncooperative. The said person also ignored a few warnings and to be co-operative. I disbelieved the first and third accused’s defence that his tone of voice was lowered and soft when the third accused spoke to Sgt Quah and that he did not shout or gesticulate with his hands. Had the third accused behaved in that manner he would not have been arrested. Even the first accused testified that there was an exchange of words between the third accused and the police officer and joined in to support the third accused. Though the first accused had intervened, he was not arrested despite the fact that he was warned by the officers not to interfere. I believe the evidence of the officers that the third accused had behaved in a disorderly manner when he spoke to Sgt Quah. I was satisfied that Sgt Quah was only doing his duty. The third accused was aggressive, shouting and gesturing with his hands. The third accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted on the charge of disorderly behaviour.
147      Regarding the charge of rioting with a dangerous weapon, I disbelieved the third accused’s defence that he was all the while with the first accused from the time they left Jalan Berseh Food Centre till the time of their arrest at the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. Sgt Yeo saw the third accused with the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused causing a commotion outside Mohican’s pub. I also disbelieved the third accused’s evidence that he drove the first accused’s car. I also disbelieved that they never stopped the car or got out of the vehicle as it travelled slowly to the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. Daniel Vijay testified that he saw the first accused alight from the driver’s side of the car and saw three to four persons alighting from the car. This evidence contradicts the third accused’s evidence that he was driving the first accused’s car that night. Goh Joo Kuan too, saw a blue Mercedes Benz stop outside Mr Bean Café. He also saw several persons getting out of the car. Daniel Vijay also saw the first accused approach and speak to the fifth accused. Sgts Peh and Yeo too, saw the first accused’s car stop in front of Mohican’s pub near the fifth accused. They also saw several persons getting out of the car. I also disbelieved the first accused claim that the boot of his car was jammed. Daniel Vijay saw the boot of the car being opened and a knife being taken out of the boot of the car. Goh Joo Kuan too, saw the boot of the car being opened and some things were taken out of it by several persons before they walked to Mohican’s pub.
148      Sgt Peh said there appeared to be two groups of persons fighting. He saw a group of persons running towards another group of persons. Some members of the group were armed with poles and ice picks. When the fight broke out Goh Joo Kuan said he saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused in the group fighting. He saw the sixth accused armed with a knife chasing someone. At about the time when he saw Marc Oliverio being accosted at Marc’s car, the third accused who was armed with a dagger approached at Mr Bean Café and told him “Relax. Sit down. Mai Chap” which he understood to mean, “Don’t interfere”. At the time the fifth accused too, was present and he too told the patrons of Mr Bean café “Mai Chap” meaning “Don’t interfere” in Hokkien. On the totality of the evidence, I found that Goh Joo Kuan was a honest witness who had nothing to gain by falsely testifying against the third accused and the others. Accordingly, I disbelieved the third accused’s defence that he was never at the scene of the riot or was armed with a weapon.
Fourth accused
149      The fourth accused could not recall how he got to Prinsep Street from Jalan Berseh Food Centre because he was so drunk. Only when he was called by a police officer, which apparently sobered him a little, did he realise that he was at Prinsep Street. He assumed that he could possibly have gone to Prinsep Street in the eighth accused’s car but wasn’t sure. Earlier that evening he said that he was at Jalan Berseh Food Centre drinking beer and dry gin. He stated that throughout that evening he was drinking with the second, sixth, seventh and eighth accused till approximately 3.00a.m the following morning. I disbelieved the fourth accused’s defence.
150      The sixth, seventh and eighth accused clearly stated that he was not with them the whole evening and had not gone with them to Prinsep Street. The fourth accused could offer no explanation how he got to Prinsep Street. Rajendran testified that while he was at Mr Bean Café with Hussain and Geetha he saw the fourth accused arrive in a taxi. After alighting from the taxi the fourth accused was seen talking to Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah. After talking to Appu Rajah the fourth accused proceeded to Mohan and the fifth accused. Appu Rajah too, said that the fourth accused arrived at Prinsep Street in a taxi. When the fourth accused alighted from the taxi he was looking in the direction of the fifth accused who then was talking to Mohan. Aside from Mohan and Rajendran who saw the fourth accused there, Sgt Yeo also saw the fourth accused with the third, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused in the group causing a commotion between Nos. 70 and 74 Prinsep Street. In the melee, Sgts Peh and Yeo also saw the first and the fourth accused climbing over the front of Mohican’s pub. They both saw the fourth accused smashing a glass panel with a beer barrel. Goh Joo Kuan also said he saw the sixth and seventh accused climbing over the wall of Mohican’s pub. It was clear from the evidence given by Rajendran, Appu Rajah, Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo and Goh Joo Kuan that the fourth accused was at the scene and participated actively in the argument and fight.
151      Marc Oliveiro too testified that when he went to start his car to move it away from the scene, the fourth accused came up to him while he was seated in the car and intimidated him with a chopper. Marc Oliveiro also said the fourth accused who was half a foot from him grabbed his shirt intended to strike him with the chopper. Marc Oliveiro was very close to the fourth accused and clearly had a good look at the fourth accused who was smelling of alcohol. Marc also saw the chopper, which he identified to be similar to (P34) found by Sgt Ameer on a grass verge near the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road where the eighth and first accused’s car were stopped. Upon seeing the chopper Marc Oliveiro pushed open the car door and fled to Park Lane Shopping Mall. Marc Oliveiro was certain it was the fourth accused who was armed with a chopper who accosted him.
152      In view that the fourth accused had been identified at close range by Marc Oliveiro and also by Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo and Goh Joo Kuan, I disbelieved the fourth accused’s defence that he did not participate in the riot or threaten Marc Oliveiro with a chopper. I was satisfied that Rajendran, Appu Rajah, Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo, Goh Joo Kuan and Marc Oliveiro were not mistaken in identifying the fourth accused to be at scene and doing the things they said he did. I was also satisfied that Marc Oliveiro was truthful in his account of the fourth accused intimidating him with a chopper.
Fifth accused
153      Before the fifth accused took the witness box, counsel relying on Kan J’s decision in 
PP v Ng Beng Siang & Others
 
[10]
and 
PP v Soosainathan s/o Dass Saminathan
 
[11]
applied for a copy of the fifth accused’s “long statement”. The prosecution replied that the defence was not entitled to a copy of the statement until after the defence witnesses had testified in order to prevent the likelihood of the accused tailoring his defence to the charge. For this proposition, the prosecution relied on 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP
 
[12]
, Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP
[13]
and 
Png Chong Hua v PP
[14]
 
. As the court was bound by the decision of the learned Chief Justice in 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP,
 the court ruled that it would not exercise its discretion to order the prosecution to produce the statement to the defence until after the defence witnesses had testified in which case the defence had the opportunity to decide whether to admit the statement in evidence to corroborate the accused’s testimony.
154      The fifth accused’s defence was that he was not at the scene of the fight and had only met the eighth accused at the junction of Prinsep Link and Prinsep Street. Furthermore, he said that he had not gone to Mohican’s pub that night. Having considered the fifth accused’s defence it was concluded, on the totality of the evidence, that he too, was not telling the truth. Vengadeswaran Gobi testified that he saw the fifth accused and Mohan outside Mohican’s pub arguing. Rajendran, Daniel Vijay, Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo and Goh Joo Kuan also saw him arguing. Vengadeswaran Gobi overheard an argument about money and club ownership. He also overheard a sum of $40,000 being mentioned. It was clear that Mohan and the fifth accused had an argument that night over business matters concerning Mohican’s pub.
155      After arguing with Mohan, Vengadeswaran Gobi also overheard the fifth accused who was then leaning against his car making a telephone call apparently to his father because he heard the fifth accused saying “Dad” in Tamil. It was admitted by the fifth accused that he had made a call to the eighth accused that night. From the circumstances it is reasonable to conclude that it was not to inform the eighth accused about an invitation to Celebrations pub or to complain about the numerous crank calls he received but to inform the eighth accused about the dispute he had with Mohan over the running of the pub. This would be consistent with Vengesdawaran Gobi’s testimony that the fifth accused was not happy when he spoke, apparently, to his father. As a result of this conversation, the eighth accused who was apparently at Jalan Berseh Food Centre, must have proceeded to Prinsep Street with the other accused in a group to assist the fifth accused in this dispute.
156      Shortly after that according to Vengadeswaran Gobi and Daniel Vijay, four cars were seen proceeding along Prinsep Street from Middle Road. They came to a stop in front of Mohicans. Vengadeswaran Gobi said approximately twelve male Indians alighted from the cars. In this group Vengadeswaran Gobi saw the eighth accused. Daniel Vijay too saw the cars arrive. He saw the first accused alighting from the driver’s side of the car and opening the boot of the car. The fifth accused was standing near him. The three or four persons that alighted from the first  accused’s car held objects in their hands. Two or three others alighted from the other cars. The group approached Mohican’s pub. An argument ensued between the group and the management of Mohican’s pub. Mohan, the fifth accused and eighth accused were seen to be involved in the argument. When Vengadeswaran Gobi went to Mr Bean Café a scuffle broke out. Goh Joo Kuan saw the third, fifth, sixth, seventh accused fighting. Sgts Peh and Yeo too, saw the fifth accused quarrelling outside the pub. Sgt Yeo also identified the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused to be present. Sgt Peh too, saw the first accused arrive at scene. The first accused was aggressive and was shouting. Whilst he was shouting another group numbering approximately ten male Indian persons armed with wooden poles and ice picks appeared. Sgt Yeo also saw some people armed with poles. There appeared to be two groups of people. A fight broke out during which the first and eighth accused were seen chasing a group of Indian persons. Sgt Yeo saw the fifth accused pushing some male Indians when the fight broke out. After the fight, Sgt Peh saw the fifth accused walking up and down Prinsep Street. Goh Joo Kuan also saw and heard the fifth accused shout “Mai Chap” to the patrons of Mr Bean Café. He also saw the first and fifth accused leaving the scene in their respective vehicles, which were identified to be Mercedes Benz motorcars. Marc Oliveiro too, saw the fifth accused walking up and down in front of Mr Bean Café saying to patrons there “Long Chong Mai Chap “ a few times. I was satisfied that Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo , Goh Joo Kuan and Marc Oliveiro’s identification of the fifth accused was good. Sgt Peh particularly recalled that the fifth accused was neatly dressed and wearing a blue long sleeved shirt. For him to particularly remember these facts could only mean that he taken a good look at the fifth accused and had paid particular attention to what the fifth accused was doing at the scene.
157      On the evidence, I was satisfied that the fifth accused was untruthful in his account of the events that night. His defence that the witnesses could have been wrong in their identification of him was disbelieved because he was clearly seen by Sgt Peh, Sgt Yeo, Goh Joo Kuan, Marc Oliveiro be involved in an argument and fight along Prinsep Street. Later he was heard telling the patrons of Mr Bean Café, in Hokkien, not to interfere.  Marc Oliveiro stated that he clearly remembered the fifth accused saying this because of the funny way in which the fifth accused spoke Hokkien.
158      Furthermore, from the evidence it was clear that the reason for the fifth accused to be at Mohican’s pub was because to a business dispute he had with his business partner Mohan.  Mohan’s fear of reprisals arising from this dispute as evidenced by the damage caused to the pub clearly explains Mohan’s reluctance to testify. Even though he and the fifth accused have gone separate ways he still is fearful of reprisals because he is still in the business of running a pub. As for the other accused there was clearly a motive for them to be present at the scene. They all knew the fifth accused, eighth accused and the first accused to be related to each other. Sgt Ameer testified that when he stopped the first and eighth accused’s vehicles, one of the accused persons approached him and told him that the fifth accused was not involved in the fight. In view of the evidence it was clear that this claim was untrue and that this was an attempt to absolve the fifth accused from guilt. Accordingly, I disbelieved the fifth accused’s defence that he was not present at the scene and involved in the fight. Accordingly, the fifth accused was found guilty and convicted on the charge of rioting.
Sixth accused
159      The sixth accused’s defence was generally consistent with the defences of the second, seventh and eighth accused. He denied committing the alleged offences and that he was mistakenly identified. He stated that on 19 October 2001, after work he went to Jalan Berseh Food Centre and had drinks with one Mr Kumar, an ex-manager of Armstrong Development, the fourth, seventh and eighth accused.
160      At about 9.00p.m when the second accused joined them the fourth accused had left by then. I disbelieved this evidence because if the second accused had joined the group after the fourth accused had left, the fourth accused would not have stated in his statement that he was drinking with the second accused at the hawker centre. Had the fourth accused left after fifteen minutes as claimed by the sixth and seventh accused, the fourth accused would not have known that that the second accused had gone to the hawker centre and drank with the others. The fact that the fourth accused mentioned in his statement (P53) that he drank with the second accused could only mean that that his statement is closer to the truth and the sixth and seventh accused’s accounts are untrue.
161      The sixth accused said he drank beer and dry gin till 3.00a.m the following morning. He was drunk and only realised what was happening until someone tapped him and told him to produce his NRIC to the police. I disbelieved the sixth accused’s defence that he never was at Mohican’s pub that night because Rajendran said he came to the pub with the first and third accused requesting for a drink. Daniel Vijay saw the sixth accused joining the fifth accused in the argument with Mohan. The sixth accused was heard uttering abusive words during the argument. When the fight broke out, Goh Joo Kuan saw the third, fifth, sixth and seventh accused fighting. He also saw the sixth accused armed with a knife and was chasing someone with it. He also saw the sixth accused climb over the front wall into Mohican’s pub. Sgt Peh too, saw the sixth together with the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth accused. As Sgt Peh, had observed the commotion for approximately five minutes and was at the scene throughout with Sgt Yeo and Goh Joo Kuan, I was amply satisfied that their identification of the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth accused being involved in the argument and subsequent fight was good. I was also satisfied that Goh Joo Kuan’s identification of the second accused being present at the scene pointing here and there was also good. On the evidence, the sixth accused was seen by three people to be at the scene and actively participating in the riot.
162      It is to be noted that when Sgt Ameer questioned the sixth accused why he was not wearing any shoes, he stated that he went fire walking. In his defence it was noted that he offered no evidence why he was not wearing any shoes or that he had attended a fire walking ceremony that day. Under cross-examination he could not explain why he was not wearing any shoes save to state that he could not remember where they were. On the evidence, he had clearly lied to Sgt Ameer that he was preparing for fire walking and had also lied in his defence by claiming that he was so drunk that he had slept in the eighth accused’s car from the time they left Jalan Berseh Food Centre for Prinsep Street. The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is that the sixth accused was untruthful in his account of the events that occurred.  Accordingly, the sixth accused was found guilty and convicted on the charge of rioting with dangerous weapons.
163      Apart from the charge of rioting with deadly weapons the sixth accused also pleaded guilty at the conclusion of the whole case to a charge of disorderly behaviour which offence was committed on 6 November 2002 at about 3.55a.m at Newton Hawker Centre.
Seventh accused
164      Similarly, the seventh accused’s too, denied committing the offence of rioting. His defence was that on 19 October 2001, he was drinking with the fourth, sixth and eighth accused first. After the fourth accused left, the second accused joined them in the drinking session that lasted till 3.00a.m. He remembered the proprietor of the drink stall inquiring whether they were going home. He was very drunk that night and only remembered producing his NRIC when the police stopped the car at the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. I disbelieved the seventh accused’s defence because during the argument Sgt Peh saw the seventh accused together with the fourth, sixth and eighth accused. When the fight broke out he was clearly seen by Goh Joo Kuan, fighting. The third, fifth and sixth accused were also seen fighting. During the melee, Goh Joo Kuan also saw the seventh accused climbing over the front wall into Mohican’s pub. Goh Joo Kuan clearly saw and remembered his face because he fell twice while attempting to climb over the wall. The seventh accused was also seen smashing a glass panel with a beer barrel. I also disbelieved the seventh accused’s defence that due to an operation he had sometime before the incident he could not climb over the wall. No medical evidence was offered by the seventh accused to prove that he was incapable of climbing over a wall and doing the things he was seen to have done. However, from the witnesses who identified him it clearly showed that he could do so.
165      On the totality of the evidence I found the seventh accused to be an untruthful witness and disbelieved his defence to the charge. There was no doubt from his evidence that though he claimed to be with the second, sixth and eighth accused at Prinsep Street than night, his entire defence was an attempt to distance himself from Mohican’s pub where the incident occurred. On the evidence, I was satisfied that Goh Joo Kuan’s identification of the seventh accused was good. Accordingly, the seventh accused was found guilty and convicted on the charge.
Eighth accused
166      In brief, the eighth accused’s defence too, was that he was not at the scene of the offence at all that fateful night and was falsely accused of the offence. His defence complemented the defences of the second, fifth, sixth, seventh accused in that he, stated that on 19 October 2001, he was drinking with the second, sixth, seventh accused at Jalan Berseh Food Centre. They sat and drank till 3.30a.m the following morning. Whilst at the hawker centre he received a call from the fifth accused who complained that he had received a number of crank calls that evening. After advising the fifth accused to inform the police if it happened again, he told the fifth accused to go home. The eighth accused then said that he would go to the pub to check things there. I disbelieved this evidence because the second accused in his statement stated that after the call, the eighth accused told him that the fifth accused was having some problems at the pub and requested the second accused to follow him to the pub to see what was going on.
167      The eighth accused stated that he went to Prinsep Street with second, sixth and seventh accused who were drunk in the car. He also stated that he only turned right into Prinsep Street from Prinsep Link when he saw the fifth accused at the said junction. He then spoke to the fifth accused there. I disbelieved this evidence that the eighth accused spoke to the fifth accused at the said junction because Vengadeswaran Gobi stated that after the fifth accused had argued with Mohan, he saw the fifth accused leaning against his car making a telephone call. At the time the fifth accused’s car was parked opposite No 68 Prinsep Street. Shortly, he saw four cars arrive. Out of the group of approximately twelve persons, Vengadeswaran Gobi identified the eighth accused. He knew the eighth accused as he had done business with him before. He also knew who the fifth accused was. Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah testified that whilst he was walking along Prinsep Street he saw the eighth accused who was opposite the Elections Department walking. After asking the eighth accused how he was, the eighth accused told him that he had come to see the fifth accused. On this evidence the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the eighth accused was walking towards Mohican’s pub to meet the fifth accused in response to the fifth accused telephone call.
168      Vengadeswaran Gobi said he saw the eighth accused and the group approach Mohan and the bouncers outside Mohican’s pub. The eighth accused was also seen approaching and speaking to the fifth accused there. Vengadeswaran Gobi’s, Selvarajoo s/p Gopal Sellamuthoo @ Appu Rajah’s, Sgt Peh’s, Sgt Yeo’s and Goh Joo Kuan’s evidence is crucial in that it places Mohan, the fifth accused, eighth accused and the group of approximately eighteen persons outside and in the vicinity Mohican’s pub that night. In this group that the eighth accused came with must have been the second, sixth and seventh accused as all of them claimed to have been with each other that night. The first, third and fourth accused too, were also present at the scene because they were positively identified by Sgt Peh and Sgt Yeo to be among the group. Sgt Peh said he saw the first and eighth accused shouting at the scene when the fight broke out. There appeared to be two groups of persons. During the fight Sgt Peh saw people armed with wooden poles and ice picks. When the fight broke out it was chaotic. The fight occurred between Nos. 70 and 72 Prinsep Street. People were kicking and hitting each other. Sgt Yeo said he saw people hitting each other with wooden poles. He also saw a male Indian person drop and pick up an ice pick before resuming to chase another Indian person. I was satisfied that Sgt Peh’s, Sgt Yeo’s identification of the eighth accused at the scene was good. Even SSSgt Gurucharan Singh confirmed that the witnesses identified the eighth accused to him at the scene to be involved in the incident.
169      Though the eighth accused claimed in his defence that he could not chase anyone as claimed by the prosecution witnesses because he had a heart condition, breathing problems and rheumatic pain in both knees, he offered no medical evidence to support his claims. However, it was not crucial that the prosecution prove that the eighth accused was an “active participant” in the fight. All that had to be proved was whether by his presence at the scene he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly. From the eighth accused conduct, it was apparent that was present at the scene and had by deed or encouragement been one of a member engaged in a crime against the peace.
170      The fact that the eighth accused was seen talking to the fifth accused, shouting, walking about pointing here and there by Goh Joo Kuan, Sgt Peh and Sgt Yeo with the group at the time the fight broke out was sufficient for the court to reasonably conclude that the eighth accused was a member of an unlawful assembly that shared the common object of the assembly to commit affray. It must have been also clear to the eighth accused that when the others were armed, the common object of the assembly was to cause hurt to others, at least from the point of time when the argument started and the group gathered. Accordingly, I disbelieved the eighth accused’s defence. He was found guilty and convicted on the charge.
171      Accordingly, I believed the testimony of the prosecution witness who saw all the eight accused persons at the scene before and at the time the armed fight broke out. I was also satisfied that at the scene they had identified all the eight accused persons either at the scene or very soon thereafter. The identification of the all the accused persons were followed up during investigations when photographs of all the accused amongst others were shown to the witnesses to ascertain whether the accused persons were involved in the commission of the offence and the roles they played.
172      On the totality of the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that the identification of the witnesses of all the accused being involved in the incident was good. The incident happened on a public road. The road was illuminated by streetlights. There was also ambient light coming from Mr Bean café and the surrounding pubs in the area that were in the process of closing for the night. The incident was clearly seen by several witnesses over a period of time when their attention was drawn to a commotion, which the accused persons caused along the road. When the fight broke out the witness were present throughout and saw the accused shouting, fighting and damaging property. The sixth accused seen armed with a knife was chasing someone. In the process, the fourth accused intimidated Marc Oliveiro. The third accused who was also armed with a knife told patrons in Mr Bean café to relax, sit down and not interfere. The fifth accused, who was involved in the fight too, told patrons of Mr Bean Café not to interfere. The identification of the accused by the prosecution witness was from a reasonably close range and they were seen several times throughout the incident by more than one of the prosecution witness.
173      Having heard the testimony of the prosecution’s witnesses I was satisfied that they had given a truthful account of the events to the best of their recollection. Though the incident had occurred two years ago, they could recall specific details of the incident that led me to conclude that the incident must have left an indelible mark on their memories especially with regards to what they saw each accused person do. All of them were very certain that all the eight accused persons were involved in the in the armed riot along Prinsep Street outside Mohican’s pub which was clearly visible from the sidewalk of Mr Bean Café where the witnesses said they were when they saw the incident. Accordingly, I disbelieved all the eight accused’s defences. They were all found guilty and convicted on their respective charges.
Mitigation
174      It was contended on behalf of the first accused, a married man with a daughter is suffering from high blood pressure and is currently on medication. His wife is currently supporting the family. It was contended that though the first accused had a criminal record none of his previous convictions are relevant nor similar to the offence for which his presently charged.
175      The second accused, aged 56 has no criminal record. He is a first offender. He is married with six children. He suffers from diabetes and hypertension and is currently on regular medication.
176      In mitigation, the third accused stated that he is a first offender having no criminal record. He is a married man with two children aged five and seven years. He attained his GCE “A” levels and is the sole breadwinner of the family. He is also supporting his aged parents.
177      The fourth accused, aged 48 years, comes from a family of eight. He is the fifth in the family. He is single. He was employed in the fifth and eighth accused company as an Administration manager. His mother, having suffered a stroke, is bedridden. Though the fourth accused has a criminal record it was submitted that none of the offences are of a violent nature.
178      The fifth accused, aged 29 years, is a married man. Currently, a director of his own Company namely, Armstrong Services. He is a graduate and in May 2004 intends to pursue further education. He is a first offender.
179      The sixth accused is a first offender. He is married with 1 son. His father is 76 years of age and his mother is working as a hospital attendant. He is currently supporting his parents and immediate family. He is currently paying 80% of the mortgage of his matrimonial home. It was submitted that the sixth accused could not afford to pay a fine in respect of the charge for disorderly behaviour and urged the court to impose a term of imprisonment to run concurrently with the term of imprisonment for the offence under section 148 of the Penal Code. In view of his conviction it was submitted that the family would suffer badly. It was also submitted that the injury inflicted on Mohan was slight.
180      As regards the seventh accused, it was submitted that he is 56 years of age. He is divorced and has a daughter. His highest educational qualification is Primary 6. At the time of the commission of the offence he was working as a general worker at Armstrong.
181      The eighth accused, aged 56 years, stated in mitigation that he is in poor health currently suffering from severe hypertension and diabetes for which he is under treatment. He has a heart condition and plans to undergo an operation to remove three blockages. He also suffers from arthritis of the right knee and right arm. He is a director of the Armstrong Group of companies in Singapore that employs thirty-five workers. A long jail sentence would adversely affect his business. He has a training and technical school in India. The injury which the victim was suffered was only a scratch on the arm.
Sentencing
182      In considering an appropriate sentence in respect of each of the eight accused the court was mindful of the four principles of sentencing. The Court noted that in their mitigation none of the accused expressed any remorse for the offence they had committed. It was apparent that they all maintained their innocence to the very end. The offence of rioting under section 148 of the Penal Code is an aggravated form of rioting. It punishes members of an unlawful assembly who are armed with deadly weapons or with anything which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death. The maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment up to seven years’ and caning.
Rioting with deadly weapons
183      With regard to the offence of rioting, all the accused were not mere followers or innocent bystanders. They were active members of an unlawful assembly.  They had admitted being in the vicinity where the rioting took place. Either by their presence or participation by their conduct at the scene they have by encouragement either by word or deed, been a member in the commission of a crime against public tranquillity. They were all seen together at the scene of the crime. They were seeing getting into Mercedes Benz vehicles and driving away from the scene of the fight. They were together when the police arrested them after stopping the three vehicles a short distance away from the scene. All the accused persons were positively identified by two off duty policemen and several other witnesses who were patrons of Mr Bean Café to be involved in the fight along Prinsep Street.
184      In determining the proper approach to be taken in sentencing rioters, the court considered the Senior District Judge Mr Richard Magnus’s decision in 
Zulkarnaini bin Saini’s
12
 
case. A paragraph 18 the learned Senior District Judge stated:
18……It is a terribly weak mitigation plea to say that the accused played a minor role, that ""he did not use…[ the wooden pole] nor hit anyone with it"" or that "" he merely agreed to follow Shalikin to SGH not knowing what to expect"" and that ""there was no actual violence or physical harm caused to the victim by the accused…who was not present there when the incident took place."" In the Court’s view, the basic approach to sentencing a rioter is that the offender is not sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation
.  
He is sentenced for having by deed or encouragement been one of the number engaged in a crime against the peace. It is a wholly wrong approach to take the acts of any individual participator in isolation. They were not committed in isolation,
 and, hence the offence of rioting
.  
Such a plea is almost invariably put forward where the offence is one of those classed as disturbances of the public peace or tranquillity, such as riots or unlawful assemblies
.
   It indicates a failure to appreciate that on these confused and tumultuous occasions each individual who takes an active part by deed or encouragement is guilty of a really grave offence by being one of the number engaged in a crime against the peace. This plea suggests that there is something wrong in giving an appropriate sentence to one convicted of an offence, in this case rioting, because there are considerable numbers of others who were at the same time committing the same offence, some of whom indeed, if identified and arrested and established as having taken a more serious part, could have received heavier sentences.  If this plea were acceded to, it would reinforce that feeling which may undoubtedly exist that if an offender is but one of a number he is unlikely to be picked on, and even if he is so picked upon, can escape proper punishment because others were not arrested at the same time.  Those who choose to take part in such unlawful occasions must do so at their peril. See 
R. v. Caird (1970) 54 Cr.App.R 499
 and in 
R. v. Keys and others (1986) 8 Cr. App. R. (S.) 444
.
The acts of the accused could not in the circumstances set out in the statement of facts be considered in isolation.  Even though he did not actually hit the victim, nevertheless his participation helped to promote the totality of the offence.”
185      The Court considered too, that public interest must be given its appropriate weight in determining an appropriate sentence where there has been violence and hurt caused to person. The Court was of the firm view that offences related to violence against the person cannot be condoned and the court has a primary duty to protect the public. As pointed out by the learned Chief Justice in 
Public Prosecutor v Lee Seck Hin
 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
:
“Violent crimes are one of the curses of our society against which it is the primary duty of the courts to protect the public. This is especially so on a small island like Singapore where citizens live in close proximity to each other; our daily lives are unavoidably intertwined to some extent making the preservation of order and harmony all the more important.”
186      The Court also took into consideration that the offence occurred on Prinsep Street, a public road and in full view of members of the public in the city area with many restaurants, pubs and music lounges situated close to each other. Members of the public often frequent such restaurants and pubs after midnight.
187      The Learned SDJ in 
PP v Diki Zulkarnaini
11
had stated that in sentencing an offender, the court can consider the place where the incident took place. He stated:-
“16.      Account may be taken, for the purpose of sentencing of the nature of the premises and scene where the incident actually took place.  See 
Director of Public Prosecutions v Cotcher
 (1992) 
The Times, 29 December
188      The Court also considered the mitigation and the previous convictions of the first, fourth, seventh accused. The first accused’s criminal record from 1979 to 2000 were in respect of offences of corruption, providing false information and employing illegal workers. His last conviction was on 16 June 2000 for employing prohibited immigrants for which he was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment. The accused is currently serving sentence for this offence. In view of the first accused previous conviction, a deterrent sentence was clearly warranted because he had made no effort at all to reform. Instead he graduated to committing offences of a violent nature.
189      As regards the second accused, a first offender, it was clear that he was not an innocent bystander present at the scene. He was seen to be at the scene of the fight apparently orchestrating the fight. From his conduct it was obvious that he was not an innocent bystander but was involved in the incident. Apart from being seen at the scene his defence that he was not at the scene of the fight but with the other accused at the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road where the police stopped him was unbelievable. His very actions at the scene was sufficient for the court to infer that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly to commit affray. Furthermore, there was every reason for him to be in the group with the eighth accused and to be interested with what was happening to the fifth accused, the eight accused’s son. After all he was a close friend of the eighth accused and had been in his company throughout that evening. He was fully aware that some of the accused were armed with a knife and a chopper.  He had willingly and deliberately participated in the commission of an offence of breaching the public peace which involved violence.
190      As regards the third accused, the court noted that he was a first offender. However, he had played an active role in the commission of the offence by being involved in the argument and the subsequent fight.  Furthermore, the third accused was armed with a dagger when he ask Goh Joo Kuan at Mr Bean Café not to interfere.  Such behaviour was certainly unbecoming of a Higher Immigration Checkpoint Specialist.  Furthermore, the third accused committed an offence of disorderly behaviour. His act of arguing with a police officer was indicative of his disrespect for authority. His behaviour was particularly aggressive which extended to threatening the patrons of Mr Bean Café not to interfere in the dispute.  As a civil servant he should know better.
191      In sentencing the fourth accused, I could not ignore the fact that this was not his first brush with the law. His antecedents and criminal record commenced in 1972.  His last conviction for being in possession of a controlled drug was on 13/6/96. He had been convicted for theft, housebreaking, possession and consumption of drugs. It is clear that the fourth accused has not elected to reform. From house breaking and drug offences he has now progressed to committing offences involving violence, causing damage to property and criminal intimidation with a chopper. He was incarcerated on multiple occasions and is currently serving the tail end of his sentence for drug consumption at Selarang Park DRC. The fourth accused warranted a deterrent sentence and the court accordingly called for a preventive detention report. Preventive detention was recommended. The fourth accused was found fit for preventive detention.  The fourth accused formal contact with the law commenced when he was 15 years of age.  It was apparent that the accused was unrepentant.  He was placed in the moderate to high risk group of re-offending.  The fourth accused is a perpetual offender from which society had to be protected.  A long custodial sentence was warranted in the circumstances.
192      In sentencing the fifth accused, the court noted that he was a first offender.  The whole incident arose out of a dispute which he had with Mohan.  As a result of a phone call he made to his father, the eighth accused and the others came down to the pub to assist him.  From the evidence he clearly played an active role in the incident and even went to the extent of warning the patrons of Mr Bean Café not to interfere.  Such brazen behaviour smacked of hooliganism.
193      The sixth accused is a first offender.  In the commission of the offence, he too clearly played an active role. In the argument, he was heard uttering abusive words and was seen fighting.  Furthermore, he was armed with a knife and was seen chasing someone with it.  He was also seen climbing over the wall into Mohican’s pub.  The sixth accused behaviour clearly warranted a deterrent sentence.
194      With regards to the seventh accused the court noted that he is not a first offender.  On 4 March 1997, he was convicted for an offence of drug trafficking.  With regards to the commission of the offence of rioting, he played an active part together with the other accused in the argument and fight.  He was also seen climbing over the wall into Mohican’s pub and seen smashing the glass panel of the pub with a beer barrel.  From the evidence, it is apparent that the seventh accused had made no effort to reform since his last conviction.  His conduct was reprehensible and warranted a deterrent sentence to reflect society’s abhorrence for such behaviour.
195      With regards to the eighth accused, he is a first offender. Upon receipt of a call from his son, the fifth accused, he proceeded to the scene to support the fifth accused.  He has brought some of the accused in his car to the scene. As employer of the fourth and seventh accused he obviously wielded influence over them as the fourth and seventh accused were seen in the group together with him and the fifth accused during the argument and fight.  He was not an innocent bystander and played an active role in the commission of the offence in that he was present during the argument and was seen chasing someone when the fight broke out
196      From the facts, it was apparent too, that all the accused had taken the law into theirs own hands by damaging Mohican’s pub and attacking Mohan s/o Ranjangam in a dispute that escalated into a fight. It was clear that there was a common object to cause hurt as some of the accused were armed and seen fighting at the scene.  There was clearly an element of organised criminality in confronting and eventually fighting with Mohan s/o Ranjangam and those with him. Even when they were detained by police officers, they were rowdy, aggressive and intimidating.
Criminal Intimidation
197      In respect of the charge of criminal intimidation against the fourth accused the court considered the Hon. Chief Justice’s decision in 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
[15]
 
in which he distinguishing criminal intimidation 
simpliciter
 and an aggravated form of the offence. He stated –
“The punishment for a charge of criminal intimidation is covered by s 506 of the Penal Code. What is apparent from a reading of s 506 is the distinction that is drawn between criminal intimidation simpliciter and an aggravated form of criminal intimidation that attracts a much harsher punishment. A threat to cause death is specifically contemplated by the section to fall within the latter category. Such a threat when made in all seriousness by someone who is not clearly incapable of carrying out the threat is something that should never be taken lightly. This is particularly so when a weapon is used by the accused as part of the threat since the presence of a weapon serves not only to make the threat more menacing, but also goes towards proving the maker’s intent to cause alarm to his victim. The seriousness of the present offence was further aggravated by the fact that the respondent had chosen to attack the victim within the confines her room. This would have had the intended effect of causing the victim greater alarm as she was trapped in the room with no means of escaping. That the victim feared for her safety was evinced by her leaving the house shortly after the incident to call for the police at the void deck of her flat.”
In 
Ramanathan Yogendran v PP 
[1995] 2 SLR 563
, I stated that in considering whether the substantive offence of criminal intimidation has been established, it should be shown that the victim had some objective basis to apprehend alarm, even if she was never alarmed. However this does not ipso facto mean that a victim’s fear is irrelevant. It is a factor that should be borne in mind by a sentencing judge when meting out the appropriate sentence upon the accused’s conviction. As I have already alluded to above, the victim was not only alarmed by the respondent’s threat but had feared for her safety. This is clearly an aggravating factor that goes towards the seriousness of the offence.
In sentencing the respondent, I was also mindful of the sentencing tariffs set by previous cases involving criminal intimidation. The most recent case was my decision in PP v N 
[1999] 4 SLR 619
. In that case, I sentenced the accused, who had threatened to kill his estranged wife over the telephone, to one year’s imprisonment. There is no doubt that the threat to kill in the present case was a more serious one. It bears repeating that the respondent had deliberately carried out his threat to kill with the use of a weapon and within striking distance of the victim.”
198      It is clear therefore that criminal intimidation is a serious offence as reflected by the maximum punishment prescribed namely, a term of 2 years imprisonment. The term of imprisonment is increased to 7 years, if the threat is to cause death, grievous hurt, destruction of property by fire, an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment, or impute unchastity to a woman.
199      In the present case, fourth accused was charged under the first limb of section 506 attracting a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The fourth accused was armed with a deadly weapon on a public road in the wee hours of the morning. In the commission of the offence he wielded a chopper at Marc Oliveiro. Wielding a chopper, an offensive weapon to an innocent member of the public who was seated in his car made the offence particularly aggravating especially when Marc Oliveiro had done nothing at all to aggravate the fourth accused. He was close enough to Marc Oliveiro to cause him harm had not Marc Oliveiro taken the opportunity to push his way out of the car and flee from the scene to safety. The sight of the fourth accused wielding a chopper not only alarmed Marc Oliveiro but would have also alarmed other members of the public who saw what the fourth accused was doing. These facts necessitated the imposition of a deterrent sentence. With regard to the offence of rioting, the fourth accused clearly played an active part in the riot.  He was seen smashing the glass panel with a beer barrel.  Furthermore, the fourth accused is armed with a chopper.
Disorderly Behaviour
200      The sixth accused after the trial also pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly behaviour which offence was committed on 6 November at about 3.55 a.m. at Newton Hawker Centre when he shouted and gesticulated at police officer Siah Lee Chye who had received a complaint from a stall holder that the sixth accused had refused to pay for food that he ordered. The sixth accused was arrested when he ignored several warnings to calm down.
201      The offence of disorderly behaviour is punishable under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. A first offender shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding one month. A second or subsequent conviction attracts a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months. As this was a first conviction under section 20 of the Act, the third and the sixth accused were liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding one month. It was submitted by the sixth accused’s counsel that the court imposes a term of imprisonment on the sixth accused because he did not have the funds to pay a fine. Counsel also urged the court to order the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. As the third accused and sixth accused had no previous convictions the court concluded that a fine would, be sufficient punishment for the third and sixth accused in the circumstances.
202      Apart from being engaged in a fight, the third and fifth threatening and daring behaviour by warning patrons in Mr Bean Café not to interfere was particularly alarming. The court also noted that the second accused, seventh and eighth accused were all above the age of 50 years and by virtue of section 231(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code would not be liable to be punished by caning. As the second, seventh and eighth accused had committed a serious offence by being members of an unlawful assembly some of whom were armed with dangerous weapons, a custodial sentence of some length was nevertheless, called for to reflect society’s abhorrence for such criminal behaviour. In the circumstances, each of the accused were sentenced :-
First Accused -
DAC No 2820/03 (P1B)– Thirty-six months’ imprisonment & caning six strokes
Second Accused-
DAC No 2821/03 (P2B) – Thirty-six months’ imprisonment
Third Accused-
DAC No 2812/03- (P3B) – Thirty-six months’ imprisonment & caning six strokes

Fourth Accused-
DAC No 2814/03 (P5B) and DAC No. 2815/03 (P6) – Eight years preventive detention and caning six strokes.
Fifth Accused- 
DAC No 2816/03 (P7B) - 36 months’ imprisonment & caning 6 strokes
Sixth Accused-
DAC No 2817/03 (P8B) – Thirty-six months’ imprisonment & caning six strokes
MAC No 398/03 (P9)     - Fined $500 in default one week imprisonment

V K Rajah JC:
1
         
 Ahmad bin Yang Besar (“the deceased”) led a lonely life. He was estranged from his family. He collected and sold cardboard for a living. At night, he slept in the void decks of Housing and Development Board flats in the vicinity of Tekka market along Serangoon Road. This had been his pattern of living for a decade or so. He had a very limited number of acquaintances. He was regarded by those who knew him as absorbed in nothing more than benignly making it through his hand-to-mouth existence, one day at a time. At the material time, on 31 August 2003, he was 74 years old.
2
         
 The accused, Raffi bin Jelan, is now 37 years old. He is married to Badariah bte Mastor (“the co-accused”) who is 28 years old. On 30 August 2003, at about 11.30pm, they were both at home when the accused suggested that they proceed to Orchard Road for an outing. The co-accused readily agreed.
3
         
 Upon reaching Orchard Road, the accused purchased four bottles of “Long Island Tea” (“Tea”), an alcoholic cocktail. They leisurely consumed a bottle each while the co-accused kept the remaining two bottles in her handbag. Wandering aimlessly, they eventually found themselves in Serangoon Road and then ultimately at Tekka Market, by which point the remaining two bottles of Tea had also been consumed.
4
         
 At about 2.00am, upon reaching a small garden near Block 663 Buffalo Road, the accused and co-accused decided to head home. However, realising that he had only $3 and that it was too late to return home by means of public transport, the accused informed the co-accused that he would try and find money to pay for the taxi ride home.
5
         
 The accused looked around and by chance spotted the deceased sleeping near a staircase at the ground floor of Block 664, Buffalo Road. He informed the co-accused that he would obtain the money from the deceased and proceeded to approach the deceased with the co-accused in tow.
6
         
 Shaik Uduman, an illegal immigrant, was sleeping beside the deceased when he was rudely awakened by shouting. He saw the accused and co-accused standing directly in front of the deceased, who was now awake and sitting. He heard the accused yelling in Malay, ordering the deceased to, “
keluar duit, keluar duit
” (“take out your money, take out your money”). The accused also yelled some Malay expletives at the deceased and slapped him on both cheeks. The co-accused did not participate in this aspect of the deceased’s ordeal. The deceased pleaded with them to leave him alone and asserted that he had no money. Angrily dismissing this and slapping the deceased again on both cheeks, the accused proceeded to forcibly remove the deceased’s wallet and stole a few dollar notes. He then slapped the deceased wrathfully, yet again, after which he and the co-accused then abruptly walked away.
7
         
 As they walked away, the deceased loudly and plaintively declared to Shaik Uduman in Malay, “You see this Malay, I am old already and he still wants to take my money. After that he also beat me.” These words were the proverbial red flag that most unfortunately sealed the deceased’s fate. He could neither have imagined nor anticipated the violence that would ensue. The accused and the co-accused were furious when they heard the deceased’s remarks and turned incandescent. In an uncontrollable frenzy, they both commenced a vicious attack on the deceased, kicking him repeatedly without restraint. The deceased remained prostrate throughout this attack, and yet not content with kicking him, the accused started raining punches on the deceased as well. The deceased’s repeated entreaties and pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears. Shaik Uduman’s imploration was to no avail either; indeed, he was warned by the accused not to interfere.
8
         
 As Shaik Uduman left the scene to secure assistance, he noted the co-accused retrieving a bottle from her handbag and smashing it against a wall. She gave half of the broken bottle to the accused and held on to the other half. There is no indication however that the broken bottle was subsequently used to inflict injury on the deceased. It appears that the bottle was broken in a move to further intimidate the deceased.
9
         
 Police investigations subsequently revealed that the accused used a penknife belonging to the deceased to repeatedly slash his face. In addition, the accused stole another bundle of dollar notes that fell from the deceased’s right trouser pocket while he was being assaulted.
10
       
 A passer-by later attempted to restrain the accused. With the help of another passer-by, the accused and co-accused were detained at the scene until the police arrived.
11
       
 When the police arrived at the scene, the deceased was observed to be lying motionless and face down, bathed in a pool of blood. His face was covered with multiple bloody lacerations. The accused was searched and a bundle of blood-smeared dollar notes was found on him. Nothing incriminating was found on the co-accused. A broken penknife and glass fragments from a broken bottle were also found at the scene.
The medical reports
12
       
 On being admitted to hospital, the deceased remained unconscious. He was observed to have:
(a)
       
 multiple facial lacerations;
(b)
       
 fracture of occipital bone (skull); and
(c)
       
 head injuries with bleeding around the brain.
The deceased remained in a comatose state until his demise some two weeks later, on 13 September 2003. A pathologist certified the case of death as “pneumonic consolidation due to extensive intra-cranial injuries”. He assessed that the injuries to the brain were the direct consequence of the external injuries sustained by the deceased and that those injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
13
       
 The accused and co-accused were sent for medical tests shortly after they were apprehended. The accused was found to have some alcohol in his blood sample and his urine tested positive for cannabinol derivatives. No trace of alcohol or drugs was found in the co-accused’s blood and urine samples.
The charges and the pleas
14
       
 The accused was charged with:
(a)
       
 Culpable homicide not amounting to murder (s 304(b), read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”));
(b)
       
 Consumption of controlled drugs (s 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”));
(c)
       
 Robbery with voluntarily causing hurt (s 394 of PC);
(d)
       
 Possession of uncertified films (s 21(1)(a) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (“FA”));
(e)
       
 Possession of obscene films (s 30(1) of FA).
The co-accused was charged solely with having committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder pursuant to s 304(b) read with s 34 of the PC.
15
       
 The co-accused pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity on 3 May 2004. The accused initially claimed trial on 3 May 2004 and informed the court he required legal representation. He claimed that the deceased had cut him on the cheek with his penknife and that the deceased had provoked the attack. He also alleged that at the material time he was intoxicated and under the influence of cannabis. I allowed him an adjournment to seek legal representation.
16
       
 Soon after the adjournment, he changed his mind and pleaded guilty to the first three charges on 14 May 2004. The Prosecution and the accused have agreed that the remaining two charges be taken into consideration. The accused now accepts the Prosecution’s factual account of what happened in the early hours of that unhappy morning.
The antecedents
17
       
 The co-accused has had only a single brush with the law, in 1994. She was detained for the purpose of drug rehabilitation between 1994 and 1995.
18
       
 The accused, on the other hand, embarked on a life of crime when he was 22 years old. His first conviction was for theft from a dwelling house under s 380 of the PC, for which he served a three-week sentence of imprisonment. In 1989, he was admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre (“DRC”) for a period of six months for being found to have consumed a controlled drug. On his release, he was required to subject himself to a regime of drug supervision for a period of 24 months. In 1991, he was again admitted to a DRC for a period of six months, subject to another regime of 24 months of drug supervision, upon his release.
19
       
 In 1993, he was convicted of house-breaking and theft pursuant to s 454 read with s 34 of the PC and was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment. A few months after his release in 1995, he was convicted of consuming a controlled drug, punishable under s 8(b) of the MDA. He was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment and fined $2,000, in default of which he would serve three weeks’ imprisonment. He served the three-week term of imprisonment. In 1996, he was convicted of a series of offences and was sentenced to a total of six years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The offences were:
(a)
       
 two charges of robbery, punishable under s 392 of the PC;
(b)
       
 a charge of snatch theft, punishable under s 356 of the PC; and
(c)
       
 three charges of failure to report for a urine test, punishable under reg 12(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3, 1990 Rev Ed).
Sentencing
20
       
 The Prosecution has rightly pointed out that there are a number of aggravating factors pertinent to this fatal assault of the deceased by the accused. It has submitted that the need to protect vulnerable and defenceless victims is an important consideration that should affect the severity of any sentence imposed. I accept this. Sentencing policy dictates that an offender who commits an offence against a vulnerable victim (this embraces the handicapped, incapacitated, children and the elderly) ought to be more severely dealt with by the court: 
R v Allen and Bennett
 (1988) 10 Cr App R (S) 466, 
R v Boswell
 (1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 317. It is apparent from the established facts that the accused singled out the deceased for the robbery because of the latter’s overwhelming and evident vulnerability. He did not pick on Shaik Uduman, who was sleeping next to the deceased. He took advantage of the deceased’s frailty both in robbing him and thereafter in raining blows and kicks on him. He heartlessly brushed aside the deceased’s repeated entreaties to cease the attack. The total inability of the deceased to ward off the attack, respond or retaliate in any significant way did little if anything to temper or quell the viciousness of the assault on him. It was a wholly senseless and savage attack completely bereft of any mitigating features.
21
       
 The savage use of the deceased’s penknife is yet another aggravating factor that must be taken into account. Where a weapon has been utilised in the commission of an offence, the sentence imposed must necessarily carry a deterrent message. It is completely immaterial that the accused did not bring the penknife with him with a view to committing a robbery. The fact remains that he found a weapon, at the scene of the crime, and did not hesitate to use it mercilessly and relentlessly to inflict grievous harm on the deceased. The numerous lacerations found on the face of the deceased are a deeply troubling feature of this violent and vicious assault, patently demonstrating that the accused is capable of uncontrollable rage and brutal violence. Wholly gratuitous violence over and above the violence intrinsically involved in the commission of an offence must, without exception, be treated with an altogether more severe and deterrent sentence; 
cf R v Roberts and Roberts
 (1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 8.
22
       
 The accused and the co-accused kicked the deceased repeatedly. It must also be emphasised that the accused repeatedly punched the deceased despite his pleas and cries for mercy. In fact, it would seem that the deceased’s sheer inability to defend himself was taken by the accused as an open invitation to exacerbate the viciousness of the attack. The accused behaved mercilessly and savagely. While he may have had, to some extent, an unquantifiable measure of “Dutch courage” conferred through drug and alcohol consumption, the fact remains that he knew what he was doing and must be attributed responsibility for his brutal conduct and the savage injuries he inflicted. While he attempted, in his mitigation plea, to express regret for the incident, he did not appear to be genuinely contrite and to accept responsibility for his conduct that morning. Until he decided to enter a plea of guilty, he continued to assert that the deceased had provoked him. Given the deceased’s frailty and Shaik Uduman’s evidence, I find such an assertion wholly implausible and categorically reject it.
Preventive detention
23
       
 The Prosecution has submitted that this is an appropriate case for preventive detention in view of the accused’s antecedents. In 
PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
 at [9], Yong Pung How CJ succinctly summarised the underlying rationale for imposing preventive detention:
[T]he purpose of imposing preventive detention is in order to protect the public. If the offender in question proved by his history of criminal behaviour to be a menace to the society, he should and must be put away for the protection and safety of the community at large.
In 
PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah
 
[2000] 3 SLR 308
 at [40] and [41], the learned Chief Justice further observed that the issue to be considered is:
… whether the offender poses such a menace to society that it would be expedient for the protection of the public to subject him to a substantial period of incarceration. This stage of the enquiry should simply focus on the danger which the offender poses to the community at large. Whether he should be incarcerated under the regime of imprisonment or preventive detention is not the subject of the enquiry at this stage. …
Once that threshold is met, s 12(2) [of the Criminal Procedure Code] stipulates that the offender shall be sentenced to preventive detention unless there are special reasons for not doing so.
24
       
 It is clear from the statutory scheme in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) that a sentence of preventive detention is an extreme measure that is prescribed for certain classes of habitual offenders and/or potential recidivists who are viewed as being beyond the reach of conventional sentencing and its underlying 
raison d’etre
. Preventive detention has a wholly different penological objective. The rationale for preventive sentencing is preventive control that extends beyond the parameters of conventional sentencing which requires the sentence to fit the crime. The overwhelming consideration is whether the court is satisfied in the circumstances that it is “expedient for the protection of the public” that an offender be incarcerated for a protracted period. If the court forms the view that such a repeat offender by virtue of his propensity to offend may yet again do so if unchecked, there would be a compelling case for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. Such an offender by reason of his past conduct and anticipated future conduct will be viewed as having forfeited his right to be accorded the considerations and attributes peculiar to conventional sentencing.
25
       
 The goal of preventive detention is primarily to ensure that in instances where there is an appreciable and justifiable concern that a dangerous offender will commit an offence again, he ought not to be “afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again”: 
Tan Ngin Hai v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 161
 at [8]. Criminals who repeatedly eschew the norms of civilised behaviour cannot complain if harsh measures are taken to isolate them.
26
       
 It is incontrovertible that the accused has a long, chequered and deeply disturbing history of criminal proclivity and behaviour. He has graduated radically and dramatically from an early apprenticeship in petty crime involving property to very serious criminal acts of robbery and, most recently, a brutal assault that claimed a life. He has been incarcerated in a DRC on at least two occasions, served out sentences for different periods in different prisons and received 24 strokes of the cane. His criminal record stretches over a period of almost two decades; the punishment the law has meted out to him in the past has neither inhibited him nor made any appreciable impact on his behaviour. He appears incapable of being rehabilitated either from his recidivist tendencies for crime or his propensity for drug consumption.
27
       
 The accused has been unable to hold a steady job for the last two decades. His recent respites outside the confines of the prison walls have been short-lived. There appears to be a distinct correlation between his inability to be gainfully employed and the current history of offending. The pattern of stealing and robbing amply illustrated by the facts, in these charges, now appear to have crystallised into an almost instinctive one, resorted to without compunction or consideration being given to the consequences that may be visited upon his victims, the public, his family or even himself. An insouciant attitude to crime combined with a proneness to violence and a tendency towards drug and alcohol consumption can only result in a potent cocktail portending a disturbing capacity for further serious crime and mischief. This is a matter of grave concern. There appears to be every likelihood that as long as he is physically able, he will continue to engage in this senseless pattern of robbery and violence, exacerbated by his consumption of drugs and alcohol. I have anxiously reviewed the facts and antecedents to see if they reveal any legitimate mitigating or redeeming factors in favour of the accused. I can find none. This is by any definition a savage crime with several aggravating and disconcerting features. The accused’s perturbing history of antecedents precludes any basis for applying conventional sentencing norms.
28
       
 In my judgment, the Prosecution has made out a compelling case that inexorably necessitates a protracted sentence of preventive detention. The accused will clearly continue to be an unpredictable, uncontrollable and dangerous threat to the public at large if he is not incarcerated for a very substantial period. Indeed, in addition, he will also have a disturbing influence and a negative impact on all those who might associate themselves or live with him, including his wife, children and family members. I cannot also ignore the fact that but for the robbery he so callously and flagrantly initiated, the co-accused might have kept out of harm’s way. The pre-sentencing report submitted to me classifies the accused as falling into the “high risk” category of criminal re-offending. I am satisfied that this assessment has been conducted fairly and objectively.
29
       
 The brutality of the accused’s attack on the deceased is the most singular and disturbing feature of the charges. The accused’s repeated and contumacious transgressions of the law, increasing in their severity with the passage of time, warrant the most severe sentence of preventive detention sanctioned by law. It is with certitude that I conclude that his criminal past will inevitably darkly mirror his future conduct if he is not incarcerated for a protracted period.
30
       
 In the circumstances, I sentence the accused to a period of 20 years of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence(s) of imprisonment. This sentence is to take effect from today. Section 12(2) of the CPC mandates that the sentence of preventive detention is only “in lieu of any sentence of 
imprisonment
” [emphasis added] – it does not deprive the court of the power to concurrently impose a sentence of caning. Furthermore, in this case, s 394 of the PC dictates the mandatory imposition of a sentence of caning upon a conviction. Accordingly, I therefore also sentence the accused to 21 strokes of caning for having committed the offence of robbery, with the voluntary causing of hurt, pursuant to s 394 of the PC. I have made a minor adjustment to the number of strokes to be administered to take into account the plea of guilty; the aggravating features of the crimes preclude a more substantial reduction.
31
       
 In so far as the co-accused is concerned, I had, on 3 May 2004, sentenced her to a sentence of imprisonment of five years backdated to the date of her arrest, 31 August 2003. I took into account the fact that she had no history of any violence or indeed crime, save for a spell of detention in a DRC; that she pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity and expressed genuine and perceptible remorse for her conduct were further mitigating factors. Her actions, while inexcusable, were not the primary cause of the demise of the deceased and she was, in the final analysis, essentially a supporting participant in this entirely senseless and unforgivable attack on an innocent and helpless old man.",2004-06-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

Tay Yong Kwang J:
1          The accused is a 34-year-old male Bangladeshi National who was working in Singapore for Hong Tar Engineering Pte Ltd located at 2 Bukit Batok Street 24, #03-02 (“Skytech Building”). He was tried on two charges of rape, under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) against Y, a 25-year-old Indonesian lady working here as a maid. The offences were allegedly committed between 10.30pm on 4 May 2003 and 2.30am on 5 May 2003, at 45 Jalan K (“45”).
The Prosecution’s case
2          Y is married with a five-year-old daughter. Y arrived in Singapore from Indonesia on 10 April 2003 and was employed as a domestic maid by PY on 14 April 2003. However, she actually worked for PY’s elderly parents, retired dentist PT, 83 years old, and PS, 82 years old, at 45 which is part of a private housing estate.
3          Y was working outside Indonesia for the first time. The first six months of her salary would be used to discharge what she owed her agent in Indonesia. She worked seven days a week without any day off. She was educated in Indonesia in Bahasa Indonesia for nine years and stayed for two months in Jakarta, learning the English language, before coming to Singapore.
4          A few days after Y started working at 45, PS told her that the previous maid, A, was a good worker. A left for Indonesia on 14 April 2003, after her two-year contract expired. Y and A have never met each other.
5          The house in question is a two-storey semi-detached house sharing a common wall with 43 Jalan K. Y’s room is located at the back portion of the house, next to the kitchen and outside the main house. There is a toilet next to the maid’s room. The maid’s room has a door and a window with glass louvres. There is a metal grille fixed on the outside of the window. Both the maid’s room and the toilet used to be accessible from the back of the compound as there were then no grilles to prevent access into the backyard. Such grilles have since been installed after the alleged rapes and they are locked at night.
6          A narrow grass verge connects the front compound of the house with the back portion. The front of the house has a driveway and a garden protected by a pair of wire mesh gates and a chain-link fence. The chain-link fence stops at the brick boundary wall of 47 Jalan K which stands on ground some three to four feet higher than that of 45.
7          The maid’s room’s window is located perpendicular to the room’s door. Because of a missing glass louvre at the lower part of the window, near the door’s latch, and the design of the metal grille, one could insert one’s arm through the grille and unlock the door from the outside. Inside the room were a double-decker bed with mattresses, a wardrobe, a low cupboard, a dressing table, a chair, a bedside table with drawers, a sewing machine and an ironing board. Y slept on the lower deck of the bed. At the material time, there was only one maid employed in the house.
8          The house had an alarm system that was activated at night. Once it was activated, Y could not enter the house 
via
 the kitchen door. She could do so only after about 6.30am in the morning when PT de-activated the alarm system and went out for his usual morning walk.
9          At about 8.00pm on 3 May 2003, Y saw a Bangladeshi man cycling back and forth on the road in front of 45. She was not sure whether that man was the accused but it appeared to her that he was observing the house. She had intended to go outside the gates to dispose of some rubbish but decided not to do so as the man looked suspicious. He was staring at her. She did so only at about 9.00pm when that man was no longer around.
10        On 4 May 2003, a Sunday, at about 5.00pm, Y saw a Bangladeshi man, whom she identified in court as the accused, seated on the stone bench across the road opposite 47 Jalan K. He had a cap on. He was using his mobile phone and was smiling at her. Out of courtesy, she smiled at him too. They did not talk to each other.
11        At about 7.00pm that day, PT’s daughter and her husband went to 45 to take PT out for dinner. PS did not join them and had dinner at home. After dinner, PS retired to her room upstairs while Y waited in the living room for PT to return. He returned home at about 10.00pm. After locking up the house, Y went out to her room 
via
 the kitchen door, locking the kitchen door behind her. The keys to the main door of the house were kept in the living room while the keys to the kitchen door were kept by her in her room. She then entered her room and latched the door. She drew the curtains but did not shut the window panes as a few pieces were missing.
12        Y then read a book on English vocabulary with translations in the Indonesian language, dozing off with the room light on after about half an hour. She awoke suddenly when she heard the sound of the door to her room being opened. The accused then walked into the room. She was shocked but did not scream as she was afraid that he would harm her.
13        The accused switched off the room light and moved towards her. He then assaulted her sexually, removing her shorts and panties and lifting her brassiere. She pulled her brassiere back down. He then raped her. She struggled and pleaded with him to stop. After he ejaculated, she managed to push him away. She grabbed a towel hanging by the bed and moved towards the room door but was pulled back by the accused to the bed. While he was hugging and restraining her, she could feel his penis was erect. He forced her to lie down on the bed again and then sexually assaulted her and raped her a second time. There was some violent struggle but the accused did not hit her. During the second rape, when she turned her buttocks and tried to push him away, his penis slipped out of her vagina. She covered her private parts with the towel and ran out of the room.
14        Y ran into the toilet next to the room and locked the PVC folding door. She urinated and then took a shower. She also used some toothpaste to clean her vagina. All this time, she was crying. She heard the accused knocking on the folding door and telling her to come out of the toilet but she did not dare to do so.
15        After about an hour, she emerged from the toilet as she thought the accused had left the premises. However, he was still outside the toilet. She dashed back into the toilet and locked the folding door again. He knocked softly on the folding door and tried to force it open but she held onto the folding door to keep it from opening. She asked him to go away. After a while, the knocking stopped and the toilet light was switched off momentarily. She remained quiet and waited inside the toilet.
16        After about an hour of silence, Y emerged from the toilet again and walked slowly into her room. However, when she entered the room, the accused pounced on her from behind the ironing board. She rushed out immediately and opened the sliding window of the kitchen. She then inserted her arm through the window grilles into the kitchen, to turn on the rear lights. She also threatened to scream if he refused to leave. The accused then left the house quickly. In cross‑examination, Y initially agreed that she had to lock all the doors and the windows before going to bed at night but stated later that she usually would not lock the sliding windows in the kitchen. This was because she had to wash clothes in the backyard early in the morning when it was still dark and, therefore, needed to turn on the lights there using the switch that was located within the kitchen.
17        Y went back into her room, closed the door and pushed the sewing machine against it. It was about 2.30am then. She took a T-shirt from the cupboard and placed it on the bed over the semen on the bed sheet as she felt it was very dirty. She then switched off the light and tried to sleep but could not as she was confused.
18        At about 6.00am, she got up from bed and went about the household chores. Later, she saw the maid (“S”) working in 47 Jalan K through the fence and informed her about the rape, crying as she related the ordeal. Both of them had talked to each other before this incident and S did mention that the previous maid at 45 had a boyfriend. However, she did not mention his name or his nationality. S left the employ of the residents of 47 in October 2003 and the investigators were not able to contact her as there was no forwarding address in Indonesia.
19        At about 8.00am, Y informed PS that an intruder had entered her room during the night. She was in tears as she told PS this. PS spoke to her in Malay and got the impression that Y had been raped. When PT returned from his morning walk, his wife related to him what Y had told her earlier. He then informed their daughter who told her husband, D, an advocate and solicitor, about the matter.
20        D arrived at 45 at about 10.30am that same day. They called the maid agency and asked the sole proprietor, Shirley, to come over to 45 as they needed someone who could speak Bahasa Indonesia to check with Y and verify her account of what had happened. Y was pleading with PT not to send her back to Indonesia. Shirley arrived about an hour later with another Indonesian maid who was waiting for her employers to pick her up from the agency.
21        After speaking to Y and cautioning her not to lie, Shirley gathered that Y had been raped by a man who was wearing a cap. D asked Y to write about the alleged rapes as he wanted to be sure about her complaint. Her first note in Bahasa Indonesia, which Shirley translated, was found by D to be too brief. It omitted details like penetration of the vagina and the lack of consent. It was discarded subsequently. D asked Y to write another note giving more details about the alleged rapes without telling her what to write. She did so. The English translation of that second note reads as follows:
Initially, I was lying down reading a book until I fell asleep the light was not off. Then I was shocked to see that man was already opened my bedroom door. He then approached me and said; Hi [A]. Eh …..I am not [A]. He said, ok slowly – slowly then he switched off the light. When he switched off the light I wanted to scream afraid that he would hurt me. After he switched off the light he took off all his clothing, and he pushed me and he straightaway grabbed my breast. I told him don’t don’t. He said, ok slowly then my mouth was covered. And my panty he pulled down. And this man raped me for about 5 minutes and the sperm ejaculated into my body and some dripped on the bedspread. I struggle but have no strength. Then I pushed and I managed to run to the door. At the door he carried my body again to the bed. And he said, ok I everyday love you. I then pleaded to him so that I could be freed. I said ok I want to go to the toilet first. He seemed to believe me and I went into the toilet by wearing a towel. I was in the toilet for about 2 hours. While I was in the toilet he knocked the door and tried to come in. After for some time I was in the toilet and when I feel the situation was quiet I went out, however he was still in my room. Immediately I ran toward the door switched on the outside light and said that if you do not want to go I’ll scream. Then he said, ok I apologise just now I was very hot.
22        The matter was then reported to the police who went to 45 to interview Y. She was sent to the National University Hospital for a medical examination the same day at about 6.00pm. PT informed the police that one G, a worker who worked in the housing estate there, might be able to provide information about one Akbar who had had an affair with the previous maid at 45.
23        The police managed to locate G. After further investigations, they also located the accused at his place of work at the Skytech Building. On 12 May 2003, the police arrested the accused there. On 13 May 2003, Y attended an identification parade at the Criminal Investigation Department and identified the accused as the man who raped her.
24        The doctor who examined Y on 5 May 2003 testified that spermatozoa were found in the endocervical swab done. The scientific evidence from the Health Sciences Authority showed that stains found on the internal and external vaginal swabs and the semen stain found on the endocervical swab taken from Y contained deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) matching the accused’s DNA profile. The stain on the towel used by Y and the semen stain on the bedsheet also contained DNA matching the accused’s DNA profile. However, no blood or semen was detected on the T-shirt that Y used to place over the bed sheet.
25        A, the maid who was Y’s predecessor at 45, was not a witness at the preliminary inquiry. A got the accused’s telephone number from another maid (“F”) who worked in a house in the street next to Jalan K. That maid, in turn, got his telephone number from another maid (“L”) who also worked in that area. The accused had been L’s boyfriend. L has returned to Indonesia. A got to know the accused sometime in 2002. They first spoke over the telephone and later started meeting frequently in the park opposite 45. The accused would ride a yellow bicycle to Jalan K and would usually wear a cap.
26        In December 2002, during the Hari Raya Puasa holidays, A was given a day off and she went out with the accused. They had some food at the McDonald’s restaurant in the Bukit Batok housing estate. Shortly after that day, they began having sexual intercourse in the maid’s room at 45 about once every week. A would lead the accused through the front garden to the room and would lead him out the same way later. PT and PS were either not at home or were upstairs.
27        However, on many occasions, she woke up to find him standing in the room even though the door was latched before she went to bed. She assumed he had unlatched the door by putting his arm through the gap in the window panes. The accused left by climbing onto the brick boundary wall of 47 Jalan K and going over the fence. The sexual relationship between the accused and A lasted until A returned to her homeland in April 2003. After 5 May 2003, in addition to the grilles at the backyard, some spikes were also installed at the top of the fence to make it difficult for a person to climb over the fence.
28        Although the accused had promised A, upon her request for $1,000 as she was returning to Indonesia, that he would be sending her some money, he did not keep his promise. After making a couple of telephone calls to him from Indonesia within a fortnight of leaving Singapore to ask him about the money he had promised her, A ceased to have any contact with him. She denied that she was lying in order to get back at the accused for failing to remit money to her. She got married in Indonesia in October 2003.
29        A used to be in love with the accused. They spoke frequently over the telephone. The accused treated her well while she was working here. He gave her several gifts such as a mobile phone and a gold chain. However, she did not know any of his friends or even his place of work. She only knew that the accused lived in Bukit Batok. She denied having gone to the accused’s place of work. She also denied having had sex with him at the wooden bench in the park opposite 45 although she did go out to the park occasionally to meet him for a short while. She denied that in March 2002, when the accused returned from Bangladesh, he saw her at the park with another Bangladeshi man.
30        Besides coming from the same maid agency here, A did not know Y. They were from different villages in Indonesia and had not met each other before.
31        F, the maid who gave the accused’s telephone number to A, testified that A had told her that she had gone out with the accused once at night but F did not know where they had gone to. F saw them at about 3.30pm on 6 December 2002 when they were at the McDonald’s restaurant in Bukit Batok.
32        PT and his wife would usually sleep with the air conditioning on. PT lodged a police report in 2002 or thereabouts, that someone was disturbing A and that A was associating with a Bangladeshi worker. This was after he was told about this by another worker whom he had met on his daily walks.
33        H, PT’s and PS’s 70-year-old neighbour living in 47 Jalan K, testified that a dark complexioned man wearing a black cap approached her at about 9.00pm on 4 May 2003 when she was at the front porch of her house. He asked her, in Malay, how he could contact A, whom she knew had been the previous maid at 45. He did not leave the vicinity after that. However, she was not able to identify that man.
34        The investigating officer, Station Inspector Sitimarsita Bohari, testified that fingerprint dusting was done at 45 on the maid’s room door, its handle and the area around its latch as well as the backyard area. No fingerprints were lifted from all those areas.
35        At the conclusion of the Prosecution’s case, defence counsel applied for all the statements made by the accused to the investigators, to be furnished to the Defence. The Prosecution agreed to and did furnish those statements.
The case for the Defence
36        The 33-year-old accused is married and has no children. He worked for Hong Tar Engineering Pte Ltd in Singapore for about seven years, installing and servicing air conditioners. His working hours were between 8.30am and 5.30pm on weekdays. He often worked overtime on weekdays and on Sundays as well. His salary was slightly more than $1,000 a month.
37        In the seven years that he worked here, he returned to Bangladesh twice. The first occasion was when his brother met with an accident and later passed away. The second occasion was in January 2002 when he returned home to get married.
38        He was planning to return home a third time as his sister had met with an accident and fractured her arm. His wife was also unwell. His relatives had called his office and his mobile phone (applied for by his employers) several times, asking him to go home. He told his employers about his plans to return to Bangladesh at the end of April 2003 but they could not release him due to their manpower constraints. About a week later, he received another call from Bangladesh and his employers agreed to let him return home for a short period. Originally, he planned to leave on 12 May 2003 but later changed to a flight leaving on 13 May 2003.
39        On 11 May 2003, he withdrew $2,000 from his bank account. The next day, he withdrew another $3,465, practically depleting the amount of money in his bank account. He claimed that part of the money was to be returned to his friend as he had been keeping it for him and part of it was to be remitted home. However, he was arrested on 12 May 2003 at his place of work.
40        He got to know A through F in 2002. After two to three months of talking over the telephone, he met A in the vicinity of 45. In December 2002, they had their first sexual intercourse on a bench in the park opposite 45. After that first encounter, they had sex either on that bench (about five times) or in a room at his workplace in the Skytech Building in Bukit Batok which his employers had allowed him to use as his living quarters. A would go there by herself in a taxi and on a few occasions, went there without giving him prior notice. He never had sex with A in the maid’s room at 45.
41        Before A returned home to Indonesia, she informed him of her home address and gave him a photocopy of her bank passbook. She called him three times from Indonesia and asked him to remit some money to her. He surmised that she was probably angry with him for not doing so after having promised her some money.
42        On Sunday, 20 April 2003, the accused finished his work at about 4.30pm and, as was his habit, went to the park near Jalan K. He liked going there to make telephone calls home, from a public telephone booth, as there were fewer workers in that area unlike in Bukit Batok and he therefore did not need to queue with others to use the public telephone. He saw Y watering the plants in the garden of 45 and they smiled at each other. He then walked to the bench across the road from 45 and asked, “How are you?” Y said, “Fine”, and in return asked how he was. He also replied, “Fine”. He then asked her where she was from and she told him she was from Indonesia and that her name was X. The accused introduced himself as Akbar. They spoke a while longer in English and he then left for Serangoon Road to meet up with friends and fellow workers from his homeland, a routine he usually followed after going to the park to make telephone calls.
43        The next Sunday, 27 April 2003, at around 5.00pm, the accused was again at the park. He saw Y watering the plants again and went to the same bench across the road from 45 to talk to her. After a while, Y asked him to help her as she needed $1,000 to repay her agent. He replied that he would try to help her by lending her the money. He was willing to do so as that would strengthen their friendship. If he could not help with $1,000, he would lend her $500 instead. He later left for Serangoon Road.
44        1 May 2003 was Labour Day, a public holiday. The accused went to the park near Jalan K sometime before 5.00pm. Y was watering the plants in the garden at 45. She blew him a flying kiss. They talked and joked and she asked him about the loan again. He told her he would hand her the money later but gave no specific date. He then went to make a call at the public telephone booth and then went to a market nearby.
45        On Sunday, 4 May 2003, the accused was at the said park at about 5.00pm. After making a telephone call, he walked to 45. Y looked quite happy that day. They talked for a while and when he was about to leave for Serangoon Road, she asked him to return to 45 later. The accused told her it would have to be very late in the night but Y said she would wait for him and then blew him a flying kiss.
46        The accused returned to Skytech Building at about 10.30pm and, after his prayers, recalled that Y was waiting for him. He changed up and then took a bus to the park. He sat at the bench near the telephone booth. When someone walked past, he asked for the time and was told it was 11.45pm. He waited there as he knew the lights in the park would be switched off at midnight. He then walked to the bench opposite 45 and noticed Y waving to him. She walked towards the gates, constantly looking up towards the second level of the house where PT’s and PS’s bedroom was. She knelt down, opened one of the gates and signalled to him to enter the compound of 45. The accused walked in. Y closed the gate without locking it. She then led him by the hand to her room at the back of the house.
47        Once they were in her room, Y closed the door and they started kissing each other. Although the accused was very excited, he was also fearful that he might be caught in somebody’s house and “everything would be finished”. Y took off her blouse and he took off his T-shirt. They expressed their love for each other, kissed and hugged and then lay down on the bed. Y pulled her shorts down and then helped him take his pants off. She then took off her brassiere and her panties while he removed his underwear. They then had sexual intercourse and he ejaculated.
48        Y said she would like to go to the toilet. She took some tissue paper and used it to wipe his semen from the bed sheet. She also passed him some tissue paper to clean himself with. She then took her towel, wrapped it round herself and went out of the room. The accused dressed up and went to the door to wait for her. When she came out from the toilet, he told her he was going back to his quarters.
49        She asked him whether he brought the money. He replied that he would do so when he was paid his salary. Y’s tone changed when she asked him why he did not bring the money. The lights from a neighbouring house were turned on at that moment and the accused, fearing he might be seen by someone, then told her he was going back to his employers’ premises. He then walked out through the gates and left.
50        The next Sunday, 11 May 2003, the accused did not return to the park as he was worried about his family’s problems. He denied that he had withdrawn practically all his money from his bank account because he was planning to leave Singapore for good. When he left for home in 2002 to get married, he did the same thing with his bank account and then returned here to work subsequently.
51        The Prosecution sought to impeach the accused’s credit under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) by reference to the statements given by him during the investigations. The accused did not allege that those statements were given involuntarily. However, he alleged that they were not read back to him after the recording and that the Bengali interpreter did not interpret his words accurately.
52        In his first statement made on 13 May 2003 pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), in response to a charge of rape, he claimed he was with his Bangladeshi colleagues offering prayers on the second floor of the Skytech Building until past 1.00am on 5 May 2003. He also stated he did not leave his room the whole night, woke up at 6.00am and then worked the whole day until 9.30pm when he returned to his quarters. The accused explained that he lied in the statement because he did not believe Y had complained about him and therefore did not want to get her into trouble.
53        In another statement made to the investigating officer on 19 May 2003, the accused claimed he did rub his penis against Y’s vulva but denied having inserted his penis into her vagina. That was because he was so frightened he could not achieve an erection. In court, the accused blamed this inconsistency on inaccurate interpretation by the interpreter.
54        On 23 September 2003, the accused was charged with a second charge of rape against Y between 11.00pm on 4 May 2003 and 12.30am on 5 May 2003. In his statement, made in response to this charge, he said he had been to 45 only once and he did not have sex with Y because he was frightened as he was in somebody else’s house. The accused explained in cross-examination that he meant that nothing happened on 5 May 2003 as he did not have sex with Y a second time. As far as he was concerned, sexual intercourse took place only on 4 May 2003.
55        In his statements, the accused also denied knowing A. He explained in court that he lied in order to protect A as she had returned to Indonesia to get married.
56        The Bengali interpreter involved in the recording of the various statements from the accused was called by the Prosecution to rebut the accused’s allegations. The interpreter testified that all the statements were accurately interpreted and amendments were actually made at the behest of the accused.
57        Pek Joo Guan (“Pek”), the accused’s boss, testified that the accused was given a room on the lower floor of the office premises, as his living quarters. He was permitted to bring his friends to that room after office hours but no one was allowed to stay there overnight. The company also provided the accused with a mobile phone and a bicycle.
58        Between 2 and 5 May 2003, Pek was told by the accused that he wanted to go back to Bangladesh as he had some personal problems. A few days later, the accused told Pek that he had to return home as his wife was sick. Pek asked him to confirm the date of departure. On 10 May 2003, the accused informed him that he would like to leave on 12 May 2003. However, the accused later changed the date to 13 May 2003. Pek then asked the accused’s supervisor, Tan Leong Huat (“Tan”), to purchase the air ticket. That was done on 11 May 2003. The same day, the accused took a $300 loan from Pek.
59        One week after the accused was arrested, police officers went to the Skytech premises to search the accused’s room. There, they found a sealed brown box belonging to the accused containing, among other things, a drill belonging to the company and a gold chain.
60        Tan confirmed that he was informed by Pek, in the first week of May 2003, to check with the accused on the date he wished to return to Bangladesh. The accused was quiet and moody. On 10 May 2003, the accused informed him that he wanted to return home on 13 May 2003.
61        A fellow Bangladeshi worker, Delwar Late Kadir Molla (“Delwar”), was called by the accused to corroborate his assertion that A had gone to his room in the Skytech Building. However, this witness said he was in Bangladesh between November 2002 and April 2003 and did not visit the accused in his room after July 2002. Although Delwar did see a girl in the accused’s room when he went to visit him there, he could not confirm the girl’s identity.
62        Several other witnesses were called by the Defence, including PS, but their testimony did not assist in determining whether the sexual intercourse that the accused had with Y was consensual or not.
The decision of the court
63        The only issues in this case were whether Y consented to sexual intercourse since there was no denial by the accused that sexual intercourse did take place and whether there was only one occasion of sexual intercourse between 10.30pm on 4 May 2003 and 2.30am on 5 May 2003.
64        Y and A were the key witnesses for the Prosecution in this case. Y was the only one who could give direct evidence of the events in her room and in the backyard of 45 during the material times. A’s evidence showed that the accused was familiar with the maid’s room at the back of 45 and knew how to enter and leave the compound without going through the gates at the driveway.
65        Y was working outside her country for the first time in her young life. She had been working at 45 for only three weeks when the alleged rapes took place and had been in Singapore for less than four weeks at the time. I found her to be an honest and guileless witness who was testifying to the best of her memory about the events on 4 and 5 May 2003. She certainly did not appear to me to be the scheming, money-hungry 
femme fatale
 that the accused made her out to be.
66        It was highly unlikely that the alleged relationship between Y and the accused could have taken off so rapidly after her arrival at 45. It was also incredible that she would have been so bold as to invite a man into the house for sex within that short span of time even if the elderly PT and PS were not likely to go to the ground level of their home during the night. She would have been aware of the dire consequences that would befall her if she was caught in the act. A might have been a braver soul but even she only started the weekly trysts after having worked for PT and PS for 20 months.
67        I believed Y’s testimony that she did not have any conversation with the accused prior to his intrusion into her room on 4 May 2003. It was obviously the accused who was observing her from a distance when she watered the plants in the garden during the three weeks that she was working in 45.
68        I accepted that there were some contradictions between Y’s testimony in court and the statement written by her on 5 May 2003. However, I was still convinced that she was telling the truth even if she was inconsistent in some respects. Victims of rape and other sexual assault could hardly be expected to reconstruct the exact sequence of events and remember details in a cold, clinical fashion, particularly in situations such as the present case. She had fallen asleep when the accused entered her room surreptitiously. She was so shocked and frightened by the sudden appearance of a stranger in her bedroom that she could not even think of screaming. The light was turned off. She was confused and still reeling from the shocking experience when she was told to write about the event. She had hardly slept after the rape. Her confusion was compounded by her fear that the event would somehow lead to her dismissal as a maid. After all, the maid agency’s boss was called to the house and there was talk of making a police report. It was completely understandable that a person in that position would not have got all the details right. She was, however, absolutely clear that she did not consent to having sex with the accused and I believed her.
69        There was some struggle in the room that night but, as Y testified, there was no physical violence from the accused by way of hitting or slapping her. Accordingly, she suffered no bruises or other physical injury.
70        While it was plain that sexual intercourse took place without her consent, I was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that there were two acts of penetration although she testified that there were. She did not write in her note about having sexual intercourse a second time. More importantly, if the accused had ejaculated after the first rape, it was not likely that he would have been able to maintain an erection and penetrate her a second time so soon thereafter. It was also worth noting that the second charge of rape was preferred against the accused more than four months after 5 May 2003. I attributed her evidence on the second rape to her difficulty in recollecting a traumatic struggle and sexual assault in the dark by a stranger and not to any dishonesty or devious plan to get the accused into more trouble.
71        The fact that no semen stain was detected on the T-shirt that Y placed on the bed sheet after the rape did not indicate that she was lying. According to her, she had been taking refuge in the toilet for close to two hours after the rape. It was possible that the semen had dried up. It was also possible that she did not place the T-shirt in direct contact with the semen stains on the bed sheet. In any event, this did not affect my assessment of her credibility.
72        A, clearly a more confident lady than Y, gave her evidence in a forthright manner and I accepted her testimony. The accused sought to discredit A’s evidence by suggesting that she was angry with him for reneging on his promise to remit some money to her. While she appeared disappointed that her erstwhile lover did not keep his word, it did not seem to me that she was out for revenge. In the one or two telephone calls in which the subject of money was raised, she merely asked him about it. There was no evidence of any anger on her part. She would not have known of his defence and would not have been able to guess that saying he climbed over the garden fence in order to go to her room in 45 would affect him adversely in the trial. There was also no possibility of any collusion on the part of Y and A who did not even know each other.
73        The failure of the Prosecution to call S, the maid who was working in 47 Jalan K until October 2003 and the first person Y spoke to after the rape, was criticised by the Defence and I was urged to draw an adverse inference under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act in respect of this failure. As held in 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
, an adverse inference would be drawn against the Prosecution only if it withheld certain evidence which it possessed and not merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence. There was no evidence to suggest that the investigating officer deliberately omitted S from the witness list or that she did so in order to hinder or hamper the defence. S’s evidence was not essential at all to the Prosecution’s case against the accused and there was, therefore, no reason to draw any adverse inference (see 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
). In any event, as acknowledged by the Defence, S’s evidence could cut both ways in that she might well confirm Y’s testimony.
74        The investigators’ inability to find the accused’s fingerprints in 45 did not cast any doubt on the Prosecution’s case in the light of the evidence adduced.
75        The accused’s testimony and statements to the police were riddled with improbabilities and lies. It was highly unlikely that A would go to Skytech Building late at night and return to 45 in the middle of the night even though PT and PS would not require her services late at night. It was much safer for the accused and A to have sex in the privacy of the maid’s room in 45 so that she would still be able to attend to any unexpected visitor or emergencies. After all, the accused had a bicycle and Jalan K was not far from the Skytech Building in Bukit Batok. He was also accustomed to going to the park opposite 45. There was no reason for A to lie about this since she was candid about having invited the accused into 45 for their trysts.
76        Delwar, the witness for the Defence, was not able to back up the accused’s evidence that he (Delwar) had seen A in the accused’s room in Bukit Batok. Delwar did not go to the accused’s room between December 2002 and April 2003, the period of the sexual relationship between the accused and A.
77        The accused claimed he was willing to lend Y the $1,000 she requested at their second casual meeting despite having spoken to her for only a few minutes the Sunday before, and the fact that a loan of that amount would be practically equivalent to a month’s salary for him. In any event, he had a few thousand dollars in his bank account but did not see it fit to withdraw some for Y. I believed Y when she said that no such conversation took place.
78        It was strange that the accused did not return to the Jalan K area again after 5 May 2003. He claimed that this was due to his family’s problems which he learnt about in late April 2003 and which weighed heavily on his mind. Those problems did not seem to trouble him on 4 May 2003 when he went to Jalan K, then to Serangoon Road and later back again to the park at Jalan K late at night. Further, why should he wait until the lights went out at the park before walking towards 45 when he was only there to talk to Y? I have no doubt he did not go back to the park after 5 May 2003 because he knew he had committed rape and did not want to return to the scene in case he was identified.
79        The lies that he told in his statements to the police could not have been the result of altruism. He was already in custody for alleged rape and stood to lose his liberty and his livelihood. It was not possible that his first thoughts were to protect Y and A. Why did he lie several times in the 19 May 2003 statements, after spending seven days in custody already, about not having sexual intercourse with Y if it was consensual? I accepted that the interpreter involved in the statements did his duty and did not misinterpret the accused’s words. As the challenge was only on accuracy and not admissibility, no 
voir dire
 was necessary (
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
). Would the accused deny that he knew A in such circumstances because she had returned home to get married? I did not think so. He lied because he did not want A to reveal his numerous  forays into 45 in the past.
80        The accused’s explanation for his statement in response to the second charge of rape on 23 September 2003 was clever but unbelievable. The second charge was clear about the period of time in issue. It covered the period between 11.00pm on 4 May 2003 and 12.30am on 5 May 2003. If he had consensual sex with Y once during that period, he could have easily said so instead of claiming he went to 45 only once and that he did not have sex with her. Clearly, he was again lying because he knew what the truth was – he had had sexual intercourse with Y without her consent.
81        The lies told by the accused clearly indicated his guilt as they fell within the four criteria set out in 
Regina v Lucas (Ruth)
 
[1981] QB 720
. They were deliberate, they related to a material issue and were motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth rather than by altruism and concern for Y and A. They were admitted by the accused himself to be complete untruths.
82        I did not agree with the Prosecution that the evidence supported the inference that the accused was planning to leave Singapore for good. The sealed box that the police found in the accused’s room contained his personal things as well as a drill belonging to his employers. There was nothing wrong in wanting to bring home his personal items. He could decide to bring them here again if he wished, after his trip home. He could have intended to steal the drill and to bring it home but that did not necessarily mean he was not going to return here ever again. He also withdrew most of his money from his bank account when he left in early 2002 for his wedding in Bangladesh. I therefore did not think the withdrawals after 5 May 2003 clearly indicated an intention to flee the jurisdiction.
83        For the above reasons, I convicted the accused on the first count of rape but acquitted him on the second count.
The sentence
84        Where the question of sentence was concerned, although the accused had a clean record, the Prosecution urged me to pass a deterrent sentence on him. This was because the accused breached the sanctity of someone’s home in order to commit rape, showed no remorse, lied in his statements and caused expenses to be incurred by the police in bringing A back here for the trial.
85        The Defence submitted that the accused was a good, trustworthy worker who had to be responsible financially for his brother’s, his sister’s and his wife’s families. Claiming trial, it was argued, was not tantamount to lack of remorse particularly since the accused was acquitted of one charge of rape. There was no evidence that Y was adversely affected emotionally or physically (for instance by being infected with a communicable disease) by the incident. It was submitted that a sentence minimally above ten years and one stroke of the cane would suffice for the accused.
86        Section 376(1) of the Penal Code provides for a maximum term of 20 years’ imprisonment and liability to a fine or to caning. Using the guidelines provided by the then Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
, I was of the view that the proper sentence should be 13 years’ imprisonment (to take effect from 12 May 2003) and 14 strokes of the cane. The accused trespassed into someone’s home, intruded into a lady’s privacy and forced himself on her. His defence accused Y, a married mother, of being a promiscuous woman who was willing to trade her body for money and, when she did not obtain the financial gain that she wanted, was quick to make false accusations against others. He also tormented her for about two hours after the rape by refusing to leave 45.

District Judge See Kee Oon:
The charge
1          The accused pleaded guilty before me to a total of nine counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).  As the charges were all similar in nature, I shall only set out the amended first charge (DAC 12362/2004) for reference:
You, Name: Lee Kheng Seng John, M/49 yrs, NRIC: S0011793E, are charged that you on or about the 16
th
 day of March 2004, at about 12.00 pm, in Singapore, did cheat one Lim Boong Kee, by deceiving the said Lim Boong Kee into believing that you were her nephew ‘Ah Tong’ and that you needed cash $5000/- as a deposit for running a western food business and by such manner of deception dishonestly inducing the said Lim Boong Kee to deliver cash $5000/- to you by placing it in a rubbish bin for your collection, which she would not have done had she not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2          The accused admitted the statement of facts without qualification.  His modus operandi was as follows.  He would browse through the telephone directories placed at the security counter located at the ground floor or Mustafa Shopping Centre and randomly select telephone numbers to call.  He would note down various numbers and their corresponding addresses.  Using a phonecard, he then called up his potential victims from the public telephone located outside Mustafa Shopping Centre.  He targeted only elderly women.  If the persons receiving his calls were male or sounded young, he would hang up immediately.
3          The accused would engage in conversations with his intended victims by asking whether they could recognise his voice.  Typically, these elderly female victims would make guesses and offer names, such as names of their sons, relatives (eg. brothers or nephews) or friends.  Taking his cue from the names offered, the accused played along and pretended to be whoever the victim thought he was.  He would then ask her for a cash loan to start a business or as an investment.  If the victim agreed, he would instruct her to wrap the money in newspaper or place it in an envelope and thereafter leave the money in the rubbish bin located at the void deck of the victim's blocks of flats at an appointed time.  The accused would wait nearby and collect the money shortly after the money was left in the rubbish bin pursuant to his instructions.
4          According to the statement of facts, the victims cheated by the accused ranged in age from 64 to 80 years.  Another 18 similar or related charges, including nine counts of attempted cheating, were taken into consideration with his consent for the purpose of sentencing.  He had committed the 27 offences between October 2002 and March 2004, cheating his victims of a total of $46,330 (Note: the schedule of offences tendered inaccurately reflects the amount at $47,430).  He was eventually arrested on 16 March 2004.  The police acted on information received to lay a trap for him at Block 643 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5.  No restitution has been made.
Antecedents
5          The antecedent report (CRO 60) revealed that the accused had 86 documented offences.  Twelve of these were previous convictions.  His criminal record dates back to August 1991, when he was sentenced to a fine of $1,600 for an offence of theft (s 379 Penal Code).  Thereafter, he was convicted in May 1992 for an offence of cheating by personation (s 419 Penal Code) and sentenced again to a fine of $1,500.  In both instances, the fines were paid in full.
6          In February 1993, the accused was convicted on seven counts of cheating (s 420) with another 69 counts taken into consideration.  This led to his first taste of imprisonment.  He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 28 months' imprisonment.  He was convicted again not long after in March 1996 for three counts of cheating (s 420) with another five counts taken into consideration.  He was found to be suitable for a sentence of corrective training and sentenced accordingly to undergo five years' corrective training.
Mitigation
7          In mitigation, it was submitted that the accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage, thus saving the court and the prosecution much time and expense.  He had also spared the elderly victims the trauma of having to testify in a trial.  He is 49 years old and is married with two children.  He has an aged mother who is sickly.
8          Upon his release from corrective training in 2001, the accused had managed to find employment as a cleaning supervisor.  This only lasted until September 2002 when he found himself unemployed and in grave financial difficulty.  He found it impossible to contribute to his family and felt frustrated at not being able to feel useful as a father and husband.  Hence, he turned to his old gambling habits.  This caused him to plunge further into debt and placed him at the mercy of loansharks who harassed him for payment.  As he was desperate, he eventually resorted to committing the offences to find money to pay the loansharks.
9          The accused was remorseful for the offences.  He earnestly wanted to make restitution but most of the money he had obtained from the offences had been used either for gambling or to repay the loansharks.  He had cooperated fully and unhesitatingly with the police in their investigations. 
Reasons for sentence
10        From a perusal of the CRO60, it was evident that the accused was a seasoned cheat.  As he had already undergone five years' corrective training to no apparent effect, I called for a pre-sentence report to determine his suitability for preventive detention.  Before passing sentence, I had also sought clarification from the prosecution as to whether the accused had adopted a similar modus operandi in respect of his multiple cheating convictions dating from 1993 and 1996.
11        The prosecution subsequently confirmed that the accused had indeed adopted exactly the same modus operandi in committing his previous offences.  On my part, I had also perused the court file in respect of his convictions in 1996.  In particular, I noted the following observations which were made by the prisons psychologist in the corrective training report dated 24 February 1996 ('the 1996 CT report'):
He presented himself as well-groomed and articulate and even glib.  The reasons that he gave for his many cheating offences do not seem convincing.  He claimed that he resorted to cheating because his wife's earnings were insufficient and not because of gambling debts.  In fact, he denied being a gambler.  This is inconsistent with the social report in which it was found that he borrowed money to repay gambling debts.  He was unable to reliably account for the quarter million dollars that he acquired from cheating from 1991 to 1993.  There was a tendency to downplay his responsibility for the offences.  Instead, he blamed his behaviour on the loansharks.  I find him suitable for Corrective Training.  
12        I accepted that the accused must have cooperated with the police since it was unlikely that many of his victims would have been able to identify him with precision.  None of them had actually seen him and would, in all likelihood, not have been able to provide any useful description of his physical appearance.  On the other hand, he committed the present series of offences not long after his release from a term of five years' corrective training for offences involving exactly the same modus operandi.
13        In my opinion, preventive detention was the only viable sentencing option in the circumstances, for which the starting point would be seven years.  Even if he was ultimately not going to be reformed or deterred, this would at least serve the more important objective of preventing further crime by incapacitating him for a sufficiently lengthy period.  The preventive detention report ('the PD report') confirmed that he was mentally and physically fit, although he was noted to be diabetic and would require diet control if sentenced to preventive detention.
The PD report
14        In the PD report, the prisons counsellor had assessed the accused's general risk of recidivism as being in the 'moderate risk' category, with a 26 to 38% chance of general recidivism within a year or release.  I was however not persuaded that his risk of criminal recidivism over the medium to longer term (ie. measured over any period beyond one year from release) might also be 'moderate'.  I shall elaborate on this as well as my other observations on certain aspects mentioned in the PD report at a subsequent point in this grounds of decision.
15        At the outset, the counsellor had noted at Part IV ('Significant Aspects of Past Criminal History') of the PD report that the accused had been sentenced to five years' corrective training for cheating offences in 1996.  This was shortly after his release from a 28-month incarceration term in 1993 for 76 cheating offences.  Apparently, the counsellor had to resort to interviewing the accused's wife in order to understand his alleged gambling habits.  She disclosed that the accused had progressively betted on larger stakes from the time before his first incarceration (ie. in 1993) till his arrest for the present offences.  The accused himself was noted twice in the PD report to be 'evasive' on certain pertinent aspects, such as his personal history, social circle and gambling habits.
16        In terms of specific risks of reoffending (see Part VII - 'Risk Findings'), the counsellor assessed that the present offences were committed because of his reversion to his gambling habits and progression towards larger bets.  The accused was also noted to lack motivation to engage in full-time employment after his release from imprisonment.  This was said to enhance his risk of reoffending. 
Observations in relation to the PD report
17        While being interviewed for the PD report, the accused was noted to be evasive in some of his responses.  Presumably, he was able to recall his previous experience of a corrective training interview in 1996 when his loquacity appeared to have worked against him.   It may be recalled that the accused had been assessed in the 1996 CT report to be 'well-groomed and articulate and even glib'.  The accused had denied being a gambler in 1996 despite evidence to the contrary and had displayed a tendency to downplay his responsibility for the offences.   In spite of his efforts, he was sentenced to corrective training.
18        In the PD report, the counsellor stated conclusively that the accused had reoffended because of his gambling habits.  Nevertheless, despite noting the accused's enhanced risk of reoffending, the counsellor arrived at the curious conclusion (see Part VIII of the PD report) that his general risk of recidivism was 'moderate'.  This may have been premised purely on his LSI-R grading, which to my understanding depends to a large extent on input from the accused himself.  With respect, I could not agree that he was only at 'moderate' risk of reoffending.  In my opinion, the following considerations made it clear that he was an inveterate recidivist.
19        First, the accused had continued to harbour unrealistic dreams of striking it rich through gambling even after having served long terms of imprisonment and corrective training.  Second, his gambling stakes had been growing progressively larger since his last term of incarceration.  Third, he had consequently lapsed into his familiar pattern of offending, conveniently employing exactly the same modus operandi he had adopted previously to cheat elderly women of substantial sums of cash.   
20        Fourth, the accused had not demonstrated any real personal accountability for his criminal conduct.  He was evasive when questioned.  He was not forthcoming with any pertinent information relating to his gambling activities.  This information had to be gleaned from his wife.  Presumably, being a gambling man, he must have weighed the options.  He must have believed that the less he revealed about himself, the better his chances would be of minimising the term of preventive detention.  Perhaps what he had not bargained for was that information from external sources (eg. his wife and the 1996 CT report) can validly be taken into account.  In any event, counsel had already acknowledged in the written mitigation plea that the offences were committed because of his unrestrained gambling activities.
21        Lastly, and more importantly, the accused was not at all deterred by imprisonment or even corrective training.  There was no sign that he had learnt from the error of his ways.   He had reoffended within 19 months after his release from corrective training.   His criminal activities would probably have continued unabated if he had not been arrested.  In the circumstances, I would respectfully differ from the counsellor's assessment of his general risks of recidivism.
22        The counsellor went on to observe that the accused would benefit from counselling to address his gambling habits (see Part VIII of the PD report).  That may well be so but his rehabilitation was not among my dominant concerns.  The foremost consideration was the protection of the public.  He was a persistent offender whose criminal enterprise consisted of careful and calculated deception, over an extended period of time.  The offences were aggravated by the fact that he had systematically chosen to target multiple vulnerable victims who could easily fall prey to his fraudulent manipulation.  The numerous elderly women whom he had deceived would scarcely be able to identify him.  It was probably wholly fortuitous that at least one such victim must have finally seen through his ploy and alerted the police.
Conclusion
23        Preventive detention was the only appropriate sentence.  I was mindful that the accused had managed to cheat his victims into parting with a substantial amount of $46,330.  No restitution whatsoever was made.  He had purportedly expressed remorse, but this had to be viewed in the context of his criminal proclivities and the aggravating features in his conduct which I have adverted to earlier.  In any event, he was eventually caught red-handed on 16 March 2004, having resorted to the very same modus operandi he had employed in committing his previous similar offences.  A plea of guilt and any expression of remorse would not count for very much in the circumstances.
24        His previous sentence of five years' corrective training had had no apparent effect on him.  In dealing with recidivists, sentencing policies and principles have always been clear and consistent: see 
PP v Perumal Suppiah
 
[2000] 3 SLR 308
; 
Tan Ngin Hai v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 161
; 
PP v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid
 
[2002] 4 SLR 154
; 
PP v Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh
 
[2003] 4 SLR 305
.  In cases such as the present one, incapacitation goes hand in hand with a long-term deterrent sentence, which would be expedient for the protection of the public.
25        In my assessment, there was every risk that the accused would reoffend upon his release.  Thus I sentenced him to fifteen years’ preventive detention.  By the time he is released, he would at least be as old as the youngest lady among his most recent cohort of unfortunate victims ie. 64.  At that age, he ought to be rather less adroit at spinning a convincing tale that he was a hapless son or nephew in desperate need of cash.",2004-07-20 00:00:00,SG District Court

Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          This was an appeal against a decision of the High Court (in 
[2003] SGHC 305
) dismissing the action of Mr Anthony Wee Soon Kim (“Wee”) against the UBS AG Bank (“UBS”) for damages on account of losses suffered in foreign exchange transactions effected by UBS on his behalf. Wee alleged that the losses he sustained were, in the main, due to misrepresentations and/or failure to exercise care on the part of UBS. We heard the appeal on 27 May 2004 and dismissed it for the reasons that follow.
The background
2          The appellant, Wee, was a senior advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore before he retired from practice in 1997. UBS is a Swiss banking corporation carrying on banking business in Singapore and elsewhere. In 1997 and 1998, Wee was a private banking customer of UBS and had accounts with the bank.
3          Sometime in August 1997, Wee decided to trade on the Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”). On 28 August 1997, Wee instructed Ms Shirreen Sin (“Sin”), an associate director/client adviser with UBS who was assigned by the bank to take care of Wee’s accounts, to enter into a one‑month foreign exchange forward contract. This involved the purchase of RM35m and the sale of US dollars (“USD” or “US$”) at the forward rate of 2.8818. Contrary to expectations, the MYR depreciated after the purchase. On 12 September 1997, Wee met up with Sin as well as another officer of UBS, Mr Collin Koh (“Koh”), a director/investment adviser at the bank, to get their advice on how best to manage his MYR/USD position.
4          On 18 September 1997, with a view to averaging down the cost of the first purchase, Wee asked Sin to enter into another one-month forward contract involving the purchase of RM5m and sale of USD at the forward rate of 3.022.
5          With the benefit of hindsight, that period was the start of the Asian financial crisis. The MYR, together with other Asian currencies, further weakened against the USD. On the maturity of the two forward contracts, instead of realising losses, Wee took out a USD loan from UBS to take up delivery of the RM40m which he placed in leveraged deposits (“LD”). RM35m was placed on a two-month deposit from 3 November 1997 to 5 January 1998 at an interest rate of 8.8% per annum and the remaining RM5m was placed on one‑month deposit from 20 November to 22 December 1997 at a rate of 7.37% per annum. These LDs were held as security for the USD loans granted to Wee.
6          On 16 December 1997, shortly before the one-month deposit was due to mature, Sin and Koh (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the bank officers”) called on Wee to update him on his MYR position. Koh suggested that Wee could realise his losses early by selling his MYR for USD in three to four separate trades over a period of time, taking advantage of interest rate fluctuations. Wee was agreeable but asked for a more concrete proposal for his consideration.
7          Three days later, on 19 December, the bank officers called on Wee again. They informed him that the interest rate for the MYR had fallen and that Wee would, as a result, be facing the prospect of paying more interest on his USD loan than he would be receiving from his MYR deposits (Koh mentioned 6.8% for USD loans and 3.25% for the MYR deposits). In view of this situation, the bank officers suggested that Wee consider subscribing to the UBS Dynamic Floor Fund (“DFF”) strategy which consisted of two components:
(a)        the MYR deposits would be converted to USD to invest in DFF. The Fund was capital-protected if held for a 12‑month period and targeted a return of over 8.15% in MYR terms; and
(b)        Wee would enter into a 12-month forward contract to purchase MYR at the USD/MYR exchange rate of 3.9745. This forward contract would enable him to have a more favourable exchange rate for his MYR as 12-month forward MYR rates were at a 3% premium to spot rates.
8          In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, in dealing with the question as to how he explained the DFF strategy to Wee, Koh deposed that:
During the meeting, I carefully explained to [Wee], with the help of some presentation slides, the workings of the DFF Strategy and how it could work to manage his losses. [Wee] approved of the DFF strategy and signed a written instruction that Sin had prepared to invest all his then MYR holdings in the DFF Strategy.
9          A few days later, on 22 December 1997, Wee wrote to Sin as to what he understood to be the features of the strategy:
… It was also agreed that I participate in your [DFF] on the basis of the explanation given by [Koh]. Put simply, it is a scheme whereby I can expect a yield more than if I were to simply deposit the funds in an interest bearing account.
Additionally, it is still open to me to “manage” the funds so invested, e.g., in the interim I can sell the MYR within 3.80 to 3.50 range assuming that for the next 18 months or so the MYR would not return to pre-crisis level. Would you like to amplify on this?
10        The next day, 23 December, the bank officers faxed a detailed reply to Wee and for the purposes of this judgment, we need only quote the following passages:
SBC Dynamic Floor 100% (USD). This will be the underlying asset for the strategy. The SBC Dynamic Floor is a USD denominated Fund. It targets a benchmark return of USD 12-month Euro-bid rate (this is 5.82% at the moment). In Ringgit terms, adjusted for costs, this translates to 8.15% at a spot USD/MYR rate of 3.80 on expiry of the 12-month period. The Fund is traded on a daily basis and can be liquidated theoretically any time. In practice, it is advisable to hold the fund for a medium term period of 6-12 months.
…
USD/MYR forward foreign exchange contracts: This is the second part of the strategy. On the subscription to the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund which is in USD, a 12-months forward foreign exchange contract buying Malaysian Ringgit and selling USD is entered into. This forward foreign exchange contract may be unwound anytime. 12-month forward Malaysian Ringgit trades at approx 3% premium to the spot or current rates.
…
The precise timing of selling the Ringgit (or unwinding the original purchase) will be done in consultation with yourself. Selling the Ringgit would leave open the underlying USD exposure of the SBC Dynamic Floor Fund. A suggested tentative strategy might look like: Sell MYR 10 million at 3.60, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.55, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.50, Sell MYR 10 million at 3.40. Each time we sell MYR, we would be squaring off and hence assuming the underlying USD exposure of the Fund. In a trading environment where the Ringgit trades in a range of 3.30 to 3.90, there will be opportunities to buy back the Ringgit at lower levels perhaps in the 3.80 area. Effective management of the Ringgit exposures will have the effect of improving the original 2.90 approx cost of your initial Ringgit position.
11        Also on the same day, the bank officers called on Wee and went through their proposal carefully. Wee wanted his son, Richard, to be involved in the matter before he made up his mind, therefore, Koh met Wee and Richard on 26 December 1997. Although Wee denied there was such a meeting on 26 December, Richard deposed that he was present at a meeting with Wee and Koh, thus affirming the events recounted by Koh.
12        On 5 January 1998, following the proposal, Wee converted his MYR deposits into USD and after deducting a 1% transaction fee, the balance of US$10,439,832.63 was invested in the DFF. The next day, 6 January, a forward contract to buy RM41,493,114.79 for value was entered into at the rate of 3.9745 and at the cost of US$10,439,832.63.
13        On 14 May 1998, after discussing with Koh on the telephone, Wee instructed Koh to sell RM11, 520,000 at the rate of 3.84 to US$1 and to buy US$3m. The object of this transaction was to unwind, in part, the 12‑month forward contract. However, the next day, on Koh informing Wee that swap costs would be involved in the sale, Wee was upset and instead asked Koh not to proceed with the previous day’s instruction. This unravelling resulted in an exchange loss of some US$63,500 for Wee.
14        On 9 June 1998, the seed for litigation was sowed. Wee wrote to UBS to complain that he invested into the DFF because of material misrepresentations on the part of the bank officers. He alleged that he was not aware that “swap points” were involved if he should close his MYR position early. Some correspondence and meetings ensued after the complaint but nothing conclusive could be reached between the parties. However, it was agreed that Sin’s supervisor, Mr Nicholas Wood, would henceforth take over as Wee’s relationship manager and deal with Wee in place of Sin.
15        On 8 July 1998, UBS advised Wee that he would stand to make a profit of RM898,020.35 if he were to liquidate the DFF and exit the 12‑month forward contract. While reserving his rights in relation to his complaint on misrepresentation, Wee accepted the advice. This resulted in Wee receiving RM41,721,419.54, a net gain of RM915,245.71. However, Wee’s gain would have been much more if not for the fact that in unwinding the forward contract, a swap cost of more than RM2,000,000 was incurred.
16        On 1 September 1998, the Malaysian government imposed a ban on the trading of MYR. The next day, Bank Negara Malaysia fixed the exchange rate for MYR at 3.80 to US$1. The upshot of it all was that eventually, Wee’s entire MYR holding was converted to only US$10,555,155. Taking into account the original USD loan sum, plus the interest incurred, Wee’s foray into the MYR market left him with a total loss of US$4,179,509.
17        On 4 July 2001, Wee commenced legal proceedings against UBS claiming, 
inter alia,
 damages for misrepresentation, breach of duty of care in contract and in tort and breach of fiduciary duties. The statement of claim was subsequently amended on several occasions. In his final submission, Wee identified the following four issues for the consideration of the judge:
(a)        whether UBS had exercised reasonable care and skill in
 
advising Wee on the MYR forward contracts of 28 August and 18 September 1997;
(b)        whether by the fax of 12 September 1997, UBS had failed to advise Wee of the risk involved in the forward transaction and to advise him to close out the forward contract maturing on 2 October 1997 instead of taking delivery of the MYR;
(c)        whether UBS had misrepresented to Wee in mid-December 1997 that he was paying 6.8% interest on his USD loan and receiving only 3.25% on his MYR LDs;
(d)        whether UBS had misrepresented to Wee that the DFF strategy allowed him to exit his MYR position at any time without suffering any disadvantage; or in other words, whether the bank officers informed him that “swap points” would be involved if he closed out before the maturity date.
18        Kan Ting Chiu J held that the first two issues did not arise from the re-re-amended statement of claim. On the third issue, the judge found that the misrepresentation had been made out because at the time, 19 December 1997, Wee’s MYR LDs were not earning interest at only 3.25% but at 8.8% with regard to the RM35m deposit and at 7.3% on the RM5m deposit. However, he went on to hold that this was a misrepresentation that did not cause Wee any loss. While it was not true that he was then already facing a negative interest position, he was certainly facing the prospect of such a position when the two deposits matured and were rolled. By subscribing to the DFF, Wee had, in fact, avoided a situation of having a negative interest differential
19        As regards the fourth issue, Kan J accepted the evidence of UBS that the effect of “swap points” was explained to Wee in layman’s terms at their various meetings in December 1997. The judge noted that even Wee’s own evidence was not that the concept of “swap points” was not explained to him but that he did not understand the explanation given by the bank officers. That being the position, he should bear the consequences if he chose not to seek clarification to enable him to understand better.
Issues on appeal
20        Although in the appellant’s case, Wee had listed six issues (inclusive of the question of proper compensation) which arose for consideration, they can conveniently be grouped under three heads:
(a)     
 
whether issues (a) and (b) set out in [17] above were pleaded in the re-re-amended statement of claim;
(b)
 
      whether UBS had misrepresented to Wee in mid-December 1997 that he was paying 6.8% interest on his USD loan and only receiving 3.25% interest on his MYR LDs; and,
(c)        whether UBS had failed to advise Wee that “swap points” would be involved in the event that the MYR forward contract was unwound prematurely.
First issue: pleading point
21        We will consider each issue in turn. The first was the pleading point. It essentially concerned the question whether the re-re-amended statement of claim could be construed to include the allegation that UBS had breached its
 
duty of
 
care in relation to the initial two purchases of RM35m and RM5m. There was really nothing in the pleadings as it stood at the commencement of the trial, which could be viewed to include such an allegation. There were no averments of fact to support it. It was only half way through the trial, after some 19 days of hearing, presumably because of a realisation that his case based on misrepresentation was not as strong as he thought, that he sought to amend the pleadings to include this. Kan J refused the application. The matter came on appeal before us and it was dismissed by this court.
22        In the appellant’s oral submission before us, this point was, in our view, rightly not taken up by counsel for Wee. There were no merits in the issue.
Second issue: misrepresentation
23        The decision of Kan J on this issue was being challenged by both parties. On the part of Wee, while he endorsed the judge’s finding that the bank officers did make a misrepresentation, he argued that the judge was wrong to have found that he had suffered no loss on account of the misrepresentation. On the other hand, UBS contended that the judge’s finding that there was a misrepresentation was wrong and should be set aside
24        We shall first deal with UBS’ contention as it would be a more logical starting point. The judge’s finding on the point rested entirely on what Koh deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief regarding the meeting Wee had with him and Sin on 19 December 1997. It read as follows:
At this meeting, Sin and I pointed out that [Wee’s] LD was incurring a loss for him as he was paying more in interest on the USD loans than he was receiving on his MYR deposits. In fact, at the time, [Wee] was paying an interest rate of about 6.8% per annum on his USD loans while his MYR deposits were only earning him interest at the rate of about 3.25% per annum.
25        However, when Koh was called to the witness-box and before he was cross-examined, he corrected what was stated in the affidavit. He clarified that he represented to Wee that, in view of the falling interest rates for the MYR, Wee was facing the prospect of a negative interest differential when his deposit rolled over on 22 December 1997. In this regard, counsel for UBS also pointed out that Koh’s corrected version of what transpired was substantiated by Wee himself in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief:
In early December 1997, [Sin] drew my attention to the fact that because of the short-term volatility of the prevailing foreign exchange market, the MYR one-month deposit interest rate had dropped to a very low rate of about 3.25% per annum. Meanwhile, the US$14,040,572 loan to “purchase” the leveraged deposit was accruing interest at about 6.8% per annum. I was badly distressed by that news. I was at that time already shell-shocked by the deteriorating MYR position and 
was alarmed to learn that I now faced a “double whammy”, i.e. having to face the prospect
 of my borrowing costs in US$ exceeding the interest received on my MYR deposit in addition to the risk of a worsening spot exchange risk in the US$/MYR foreign exchange rate. [Sin] then arranged for me to meet Colin Koh and herself on 19 December 1997. [emphasis added]
26        In Wee’s supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief he again repeated that the bank officers told him of the then volatile foreign exchange market. He stated:
I have, at paragraph 45 of my Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, deposed that in early December 1997, [Sin] drew my attention to the fact that because of the short-term volatility of the prevailing foreign exchange market, the MYR one-month deposit interest rate had dropped to a very low rate of about 3.25% per annum, while the US$14,040,572 loan taken to “purchase” the leveraged deposit was accruing interest at about 6.8% per annum.
27        Therefore, it was not Wee’s position that the bank officers had represented to him that his MYR LDs were, on 19 December 1997, already only earning 3.25% per annum. In Wee’s mind, he was clear that at the time, in view of the serious drop in the one‑month MYR deposit interest rate, he was facing the prospect of a “double whammy” (
ie
, the direct exchange loss and the negative interest differential). There was no misapprehension on Wee’s part and this also appeared from the following cross-examination of him:
Q:         And looking at para 45, the last few lines where you say “… was alarmed to learn that I now faced a ‘double whammy’ … having to face the prospect …”; the ‘prospect’ there means in future, correct?
A:         That was the impression I was led to believe, Sir.
Q:         Thank you. Therefore if you stayed in Ringgit and rollover the Ringgit in future, you would face the prospect of a double whammy?
A:         That was what I was led to believe on the 23
rd
 of December, Sir.
28        At the time the meeting of 19 December 1997 took place, the RM5m deposit had only three days left before maturity. A decision had to be taken by Wee whether to roll over on 22 December 1997 or do something else. If he decided to roll over, he would suffer a negative interest differential as the interest rate he was paying on the USD loans which he had obtained to fund the RM5m purchase was higher than the interest which the RM5m deposit would earn if rolled over on 22 December 1997.
29        The approach taken by the judge in finding that there was a misrepresentation was set out in [14] and [15] of his judgment as follows:
When confronted with that [paragraph in Koh’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief], Sin and Koh conceded that they were mistaken. They tried to redeem themselves by explaining that when they had the discussion on 19 December, they knew that the defendant would face a negative interest rate differential if he rolled over the deposits again.
While that was correct, it was not what they had deposed to, that on 19 December they told the plaintiff that he was 
already
 experiencing negative interest on his deposits.
30        It seemed to us that the judge failed to appreciate that when Koh explained that what was stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief was a mistake, he meant to say the paragraph in his affidavit had not accurately described what transpired. Koh did not concede that he made any misrepresentation. He was saying that the paragraph in his affidavit did not accurately describe what he said to Wee that day due to some loose language. The judge held Koh to what he stated in his affidavit and did not accept Koh’s clarification of the mistake made in that paragraph of his affidavit.
31        Apart from the fact that Wee himself, as shown above, knew that Koh was referring to a state of affairs which was to come in a matter of a few days, Wee did not allege that the bank officers had made the misrepresentation. Moreover, we could see no reason why Koh or Sin would need to resort to any misrepresentation. Their purpose in coming to see Wee was to update him on the unfortunate turn of events in the foreign currency market involving the USD and MYR and to give him time to assess what to do in the apparently bad situation (
ie 
 with the MYR deposits at that point in time, earning less in interest than the interest which Wee would have to pay on the USD loans). There was no reason why the alleged misrepresentation would need to be made at all. Wee knew
 
clearly that Koh was referring to things to come, upon the maturity of the current MYR LDs. The judge appeared not to have given any consideration to the clarification made by Koh or the fact that Wee knew precisely what Koh was referring to (
ie
 of the state of affairs which would soon come to pass). Neither did he consider, in determining which was the true version, whether there was any reason for the bank officers in wanting to make the alleged misrepresentation. Accordingly, and with respect, we differed from the judge and found that no such misrepresentation was made.
32        We were conscious that this was a finding of fact by the trial judge. We noted that the judge did not say that the bank officers were unreliable. We think, in this case, we were in as good a position as the court below to come to a determination on the factual issue. Here, we would quote what this court stated in 
Teknikal dan Kejuruteraan Pte Ltd v Resources Development Corp (Pte) Ltd
 
[1994] 3 SLR 743
 at [56]:
… The issues before us concern to an extent the evaluation of the quality of the evidence given by RDC’s witnesses. 
The evaluation involves testing a witness’s evidence against inherent probabilities or against uncontroverted facts
, including the conduct of the parties at the relevant time. 
We are in this instance in as good a position as the court of first instance
, although we must, where
 
appropriate, give due allowance to the fact that we have not had the advantage of seeing the witnesses that the trial court had. [emphasis added]
33        In view of the above determination, Wee’s challenge that the judge was not correct to hold that Wee had suffered no loss on account of the misrepresentation had become academic. Nevertheless, we will briefly address the point. The reasons why the judge came to that view were set out in [17] to [19] of his judgment as follows
… In his affidavit [Wee] acknowledged that he was warned about negative interest rate differential and the worsening exchange rate before the meeting of 19 December, and was alarmed by the prospect of being in that position. When he met Sin and Koh on 19 December, they were still speaking of the negative interest rate differential, though they overstated the case in saying that he was already in that position when he was actually facing the prospect of being in that position.
By his own account, he was sufficiently alarmed at the 
prospect
 of negative interest to want to avoid the “double whammy”. The prospect was as real whether or not he was already in negative interest, whether he was told “You are in negative interest” or “You will be in negative interest if you roll over the deposits.”
There was no question that if the deposits were rolled over, they would yield reduced interest at around 3.25%. As the plaintiff subscribed to the SBC Fund to avoid negative interest, and had avoided that, he cannot complain about the advice, the mistake notwithstanding. He had benefited from the decision. The plaintiff has not shown that the representation caused him loss.
34        We agree with the judge that no loss had been shown by Wee. Assuming that Wee was told on 19 December that he was already in a negative interest position but in fact was not, that misstatement, as such, did not cause him to suffer any loss. Up to the maturity of the two MYR LDs he would be receiving the benefits of the positive interest differential. Nothing could change that.
35        Upon the expiry of each of the LDs, the misrepresentation would then become immaterial. At that point, if Wee were to decide that he would like to roll over the deposits, they would only earn interest at 3.25% per annum giving rise to the situation of a negative interest differential, a position which the bank officers were trying to help him to avoid. On account of that stark reality, Wee decided to adopt the DFF strategy which enabled him to overcome that situation. We were unable to see any loss arising.
Third issue: “swap points”
36        On this issue, the judge held that the bank officers had explained the DFF strategy, including the “swap points”, to Wee over the several meetings from 16 to 26 December 1997. Wee was told that “swap points” would come into play if he should exit from his forward position prematurely.
37        This issue was Wee’s main plank in this appeal. His claim in damages for breach of fiduciary duties or in contract, depended entirely on whether he was advised on the “swap points”. He also alleged that there was misrepresentation on account of this omission. Generally, misrepresentation entails a positive assertion of fact. It is unnecessary for us to go further into this as the judge found, and we agreed, that there was no omission.
38        Wee submitted that the judge’s finding on the question was wholly erroneous. He argued that Koh and Sin never mentioned the matter of “swap points” at the meeting of 19 December and neither was it stated in their letters to him of 18 and 23 December 1997. It was only mentioned in a passing reference in Sin’s fax of 29 December with no explanation of the effect of the “swap points”. In any event, this fax came after Wee had agreed to adopt the DFF strategy.
39        The first observation we would make is that on this issue, Wee was challenging a finding of fact of the trial judge. What he was arguing was that the judge should accept his evidence instead of the evidence of the bank officers. It is trite law that an appellate court will not upset a finding of fact which is based on the evidence of witnesses, unless the appellant satisfies the appellate court that this determination of the trial judge is plainly wrong: see 
Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong
 
[1996] 2 SLR 305
 and 
Seah Ting Soon t/a Sing Meng Co Wooden Cases Factory v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd
 
[2001] 1 SLR 521
. We are conscious of our decision above at [31] and [32] where we upset a finding of fact of the judge. But the situation here is quite different from the position there.
40        The second is that it was not Wee’s evidence at the trial that there was no explanation of the matter of “swap points” by the bank officers. His position was that although the officers did explain the “swap points”, he did not understand the concept. At [37] of his judgment, Kan J stated:
It was also clear that the plaintiff only committed himself to the strategy after the discussions, and he was informed of the transactions after they were made. His own evidence was not that there were no explanations of the premium/swap points and the
 
consequences of closing out a forward position before maturity, but that he did not understand them. But he did not inform Koh or Sin [of] that or that he still needed more explanation. After the discussions, he confirmed that he accepted the strategy proposed.
41        Before we go into the evidence which supported the judge’s finding that the bank officers did explain the matter of “swap points”, we will quote a passage of the judge at [21], where he explained the nature of “swap points”
When a purchaser buys currency on a forward contract, e.g. buy MYR with US$ on a 12-month forward contract, he does not pay the spot exchange rate. As the two currencies would pay interest at different rates, swap points worked out on the difference between the rates have to be factored into the applicable forward exchange rate. When the transaction is to buy a higher interest currency with a lower
 
interest currency, the swap points will be in favour of the purchaser. The swap points in such a situation can be described as a discount on the purchase price, or a premium to the purchaser. When the purchaser decides to close out the forward position before time, he enters into a reverse transaction, to sell the same amount of MYR and buy US$ on the same forward date to cancel the earlier transaction. It is another forward transaction (albeit for a shorter period), to buy and sell the two currencies in the reversed order. This second transaction, being a forward transaction, is not transacted on the prevailing spot rate. Swap points will also have to be worked out on the different interest rates then prevailing. If that works out to the disadvantage of the buyer he has to pay above the spot rate.
42        UBS’s expert, Professor Heinz Riehl, put the matter very succinctly as follows:
The exchange rate differential between a spot exchange rate and a forward exchange rate is also known as the foreign exchange swap rate. The forward exchange rate is equal to the spot exchange rate plus the swap exchange rate, and the swap exchange rate is nothing but the interest rate differential expressed in terms of a foreign exchange rate differential.
43        The position can perhaps be more readily understood if we use the more common transaction of a fixed deposit as an example. If a person has a fixed deposit for 12 months at 10% per annum, he cannot reasonably think that he will, as of right, still receive a return of 10% per annum, if he breaks the deposit prematurely. A penalty for the early breakage is to be expected. The penalty will naturally be computed by reference to the relevant interest rate prevailing at the time of the breakage.
44        Wee, in his Case, emphasised that at the meeting of 19 December there was no mention of “swap points”. Koh, however, said that at the meeting he explained the operation of the “swap points” by reference to interest rate differentials. He also said that he explained the DFF strategy with the help of some presentation materials, one of which was a chart. Copies of these materials were given to Wee. Here, we would quote Koh’s evidence in court explaining the chart:
If you look at this table or the chart, on the top left hand corner, you will find basically some numbers there. The third number gives “SPOT … MYR” AT 3.9000. You will find that two rows down from that, you will see “FWD 1 YEAR 0.1350”. Then you will find “FWD RATE 4.03500”. Now essentially, 3.90 plus 0.1350 equals 4.0350. Now we defined what these swap points were, they were defined as an interest rate differential between the MYR and USD on a one year basis for that period because these were one year MYR forwards.
45        After the meeting of 19 December, there was correspondence on 22 December and 23 December, followed by a meeting on the very same day. At Wee’s request, there was a further meeting on 26 December for the purpose of explaining the DFF strategy to Wee’s son, Richard. On 29 December, Sin wrote a report to Wee, where the following was stated:
At the same time, we have done a forward for one year at 3.9745, the breakdown being: client sells USD10,439,832.63 buys MYR41,493,114.79 at 3.87 (spot) + 0.1045 (Swap) i.e. 3.9745 for value 6 Jan 1999.
There was no query from Wee as to what was meant by “swap”.
46        The judge, having reviewed the evidence, including the documents, came to the following conclusions at [36] to [38]:
It was not disputed that the plaintiff, Sin and Koh met in December and discussed the predicament that he was in and the options available for him to mitigate his losses. At that time, the plaintiff was very concerned at the position he was in. The meetings they had were not casual gatherings. There were serious matters to be discussed and decisions to be taken. Koh elaborated at the trial that “(t)here are about six hours worth of meetings on the 16
th
, 19
th
, 23
rd
 and also on the 26
th
 in addition after [the letter of 23 December] was written. And those six hours [of] meetings, there was very, very full discussion on the operation of the forward in conjunction with the Dynamic Floor Fund.”
It was also clear that the plaintiff only committed himself to the strategy after the discussions, and he was informed of the transactions after they were made. His own evidence was not that there were no explanations of the premium/swap points and the consequences of closing out a forward position before maturity, but that he did not understand them. But he did not inform Koh or Sin [of] that or that he still needed more explanation. After the discussions, he confirmed that he accepted the strategy proposed.
Much was said by his counsel that in the letters, visit reports and the transcript of telephone conversations produced at the trial, there was no explicit statement that the premium/swap points may have to be paid back. Koh said that that was covered in the discussions they had and I accept that. Sin had also referred to that to the plaintiff and his son. The plaintiff’s reply was that the discussions and Sin’s explanation on premium and spot rates were gobbledygook to him. But he is not diffident or tongue-tied, and he was a big client. If he needed further explanation, he kept that to himself and gave instructions to enter into the strategy instead. The evidence was that whenever he sought explanations and clarifications from Sin or Koh, they would provide them.
47        There was no basis for us to interfere with this finding of fact of the judge, who preferred the evidence of the bank officers over that of Wee. Wee was shown to be unreliable (
eg
 he claimed to be a novice in foreign exchange dealings when he was not so and he denied that there was a meeting on 26 December when his son admitted there was). It was not only a decision that was not against the weight of the evidence, it was plainly correct. Moreover, his final position would appear to be that perhaps the matter of “swap points” might have been explained to him by the bank officers but he did not understand it.
48        In closing, we would add that in his more than 30 years of legal practice, Wee had routinely advised banks on legal matters. He obviously had reasonable knowledge of matters relating to banking. Before he dealt with UBS, he was a customer of Citibank with whom he had carried out a number of foreign exchange transactions. Wee is not a person who will take things lying down or suffer in silence. He is not a person who would do anything unless he fully understands the situation.
49        It was unfortunate that Wee’s speculation in the MYR on such a huge scale had turned sour, thereby incurring substantial losses. However, that is a risk which every trader in foreign currency will have to bear. There was evidence that his foray into the MYR was at the suggestion of his son, Richard. Thus, when he was confronted with the prospect of a “double whammy”, he brought Richard into the picture before a decision was taken by Wee to subscribe to the DFF strategy. We could see no basis to place the loss at the door of UBS.
50        In the result, we dismissed the appeal and awarded costs to the respondent. The security for costs, together with any accrued interest, was ordered to be released to the respondent to account for the respondent’s costs of this appeal.",2004-07-29 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Woo Bih Li J:
Background
1          In my judgment of 7 June 2004, I declared that the plaintiff, RBG Resources plc (“RBG”), remained the legal and beneficial owner of metals in certain warehouses which had been held for the account of RBG prior to any dealing of the metals between RBG and the second defendant, Credit Lyonnais (“CL”), save for one drum of nickel identified as 519-W127 by SGS Testing & Control Services Singapore Pte Ltd. I also ordered that the sale proceeds of RBG’s metal be released to RBG or its solicitors.
2          I further ordered CL to pay damages to RBG for conversion of nickel briquettes which CL had taken delivery of from one of the warehouses, such damages being the net purchase price or prices which CL had obtained for the briquettes as CL had sold the same.
3          Consequently, CL’s counterclaim for the metals in the warehouses, which also formed the subject matter of RBG’s claim, was dismissed, save for the one drum of nickel identified as 519-W127. CL was consequently entitled to the sale proceeds of that one drum of nickel.
4          I reserved the question of costs and interest for counsel’s submissions. After hearing submissions, I made certain orders on costs and interest. I set out below the arguments and my orders and reasons.
Costs
5          On the question of costs, RBG sought an order for costs of the entire proceedings to be paid by CL although it did not succeed on an issue under s 62(4) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). I will refer to this legislation as “the Act”.
6          RBG relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
MCST No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd
 
[2002] 2 SLR 1
 where Yong Pung How CJ said at [57]:
The principles governing the award of costs are elucidated in 
Re Elgindata (No 2)
 [1993] 1 All ER 232, and adopted in Singapore in 
Tullio v Maoro
 
[1994] 2 SLR 489
.  The relevant passage in 
Re Elgindata (No 2)
 provides (at p 237):
The principles are these.  (1)  Costs are in the discretion of the court.  (2)  They should follow the event, except when it appears to the court that … some other order should be made.  (3)  The general rule does not cease to apply simply because that successful party raises issues or makes allegations on which he fails, but where that has caused a significant increase in the length or cost of the proceedings he may be deprived of the whole or a part of his costs.  (4)  Where the successful party raises issues or makes allegations improperly or unreasonably, the court may not only deprive him of his costs but order him to pay the whole or a part of the unsuccessful party’s costs … the fourth implies that a successful party who neither improperly nor unreasonably raises issues or makes allegations on which he fails ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the unsuccessful party’s costs.
As the respondent was the successful party below, according to principle (2), prima facie, it should be awarded costs.  As for principle (3), the starting point was that the respondent failed on one ground, 
colore officii
.  However, it should not be deprived of its costs.  Firstly, the trial ended within the allotted time.  Secondly, as the respondent relied on the same facts for proving mistake of law and for proving 
colore officii
, and as the appellant relied on the same defences to both claims, it was unlikely that the respondent’s pleading 
colore officii
 caused a significant increase in the cost of the proceedings.  The respondent had also paid costs to the appellant for the late amendment of its pleadings.  Since it was not alleged that the respondent had raised issues improperly or unreasonably, according to principle (4), it was not ordered to pay the appellant’s costs.
7          RBG argued that it was entitled to the costs for the entire proceedings because, firstly, the trial ended within the number of days for which it was fixed for hearing and, secondly, the s 62(4) issue was a legitimate one raised in response to CL’s own reliance on another provision of the Act, 
ie
 s 20A. It would have been irresponsible not to raise the s 62(4) issue.
8          RBG also disclosed that it had made offers to settle. The first offer was served on 22 December 2003 but was subsequently withdrawn. The second offer was served on 23 December 2003. The third offer was served on 9 January 2004, a day after the commencement of trial.
9          The second offer was on the following terms:
(i)         The Plaintiff is to discontinue its claim against the 2
nd
 Defendant for damages for conversion of 300mt of nickel briquettes while the 2
nd
 Defendant is to discontinue its counterclaims against the Plaintiff;
(ii)        Each party is to bear its own legal costs.
10        The third offer was on the following terms:
(i)         The Plaintiff is to discontinue its claim against the 2
nd
 Defendant for damages for conversion of 300mt of nickel briquettes.
(ii)        The 2
nd
 Defendant is to discontinue all its counterclaims against the Plaintiff, namely, the 2
nd
 Defendant’s counterclaim for the nickel cathodes, copper cathodes and tin ingots in the Warehouses.
(iii)       The 2
nd
 Defendant is to withdraw its defence to the Plaintiff’s claim to the nickel cathodes, copper cathodes and tin ingots in the Warehouses.
(iv)       The Plaintiff is to pay the 2
nd
 Defendant the sum of US$100,000.
(v)        Each party is to bear its own legal costs.
11        I should add that the value of the metals in the warehouses which were the subject of RBG’s and CL’s claims was between US$8m and US$9m and the value of the nickel briquettes under the claim for conversion was over US$2m.
12        As RGB was successful in its claim for the metals in the warehouses and also successful in its claim for conversion, RBG sought indemnity costs from the date of service of the second offer or, alternatively, from the date of service of the third offer, and party to party costs for the period before. For its primary position, RBG relied on the judgment of Kan Ting Chiu J in 
LK Ang Construction Pte Ltd v Chubb Singapore Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 1 SLR 134
 where he said at [18]:
I do not think that an offer should be deemed to withdraw a previous offer. The rules do not provide for deemed withdrawals other than by expiration of time (r 3(4)). A subsequent offer will have that effect if it states that expressly, but that should not be a deemed effect. If no withdrawal is expressed then both offers remain open for acceptance as long as they remain and have not expired. It may be purposeless for the offeree to consider a $50,000 offer that is followed by a $100,000 offer, but that is meaningful to the offeror if judgment is entered for less than $50,000 as his entitlement to indemnity costs runs from the date of service of the $50,000 offer. Offers of different sums may have different attractions. An offer of $50,000 to be paid immediately may not be less attractive than a $75,000 offer to be paid in instalments, and there is no reason why the offeree should not be allowed to choose between them.
13        RBG also sought a certification of costs for two counsel under O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed). RBG submitted that the case involved complex factual and legal issues and novel questions of law. On the factual side, the case involved metal trading which has its own rules and processes. Both sides had to consult and engage experts to understand and explain to the court these rules and processes. On the legal side, RBG submitted that s 20A had not been previously considered by any court in the Commonwealth which relies on the English Sale of Goods Act as does Singapore.  RBG further submitted that the issues were diverse.  I should also mention that RBG were represented by Sarjit Singh Gill SC and Quek Mong Hua who were from different law firms and each of these counsel had his own colleague or colleagues assisting too.
14        CL did not agree that RBG should be awarded the entire costs of the action. Furthermore, its position was that all costs in relation to the defences and counterclaims of other defendants should be excluded.
15        CL submitted that work done up to and including the filing of RBG’s re‑amended statement of claim, excluding the claim for conversion, should not be awarded to RBG as its statement of claim, prior to amendment, disclosed no reasonable cause of action and/or was an abuse of court process.
16        CL also objected to costs being awarded to RBG for work done in relation to affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of three persons ie Tay Choon Peng, Clement Paul Danin and Kon Yin Tong, and also asserted that costs in relation to the AEIC of Malcolm Shierson should be reduced significantly.  Various reasons were given for the objections.
17        As for the s 62(4) issue, CL submitted that not only should RBG be deprived of costs thereof, RBG should pay such costs to CL.
18        On the offers to settle, CL submitted that the second offer was not complete as it did not address the rest of the proceedings, 
ie
 what CL was to do about RBG’s claim and its defence thereto. Indeed, CL’s solicitors had written to RBG’s solicitors regarding this on 24 December 2003. There was no response and instead, the third offer to settle was served. CL submitted that as the third offer to settle was served so late, it was not designed to encourage a settlement but to put pressure on CL. By then, the mind-set of CL was to go to trial. CL argued that an offer to settle should have been served with an ample amount of time for CL to consider. Accordingly, CL submitted that the court should disregard the offers to settle. CL relied on, 
inter alia
, 
Track-Truss Technologies Pte Ltd v UTi Worldwide (Singapore)
 
[2004] SGDC 42
, a judgment of the District Court which referred to an unreported supplementary judgment on costs dated 31 March 1999 of the Court of Appeal in 
Neo Hock Pheng v Teo Siew Pheng
 in Civil Appeal No 170 of 1998.
19        CL also submitted that the second offer was incomplete as it did not mention what was to happen to RBG’s claim to the metals in the warehouses. Hence, if RBG were to be granted indemnity costs, it should run from the date of service of the third offer.
20        As for the question of a certification of costs for two counsel, CL submitted that RBG had over-manned the litigation. CL had effectively had only one counsel as Mr Lawrence Teh’s colleague who assisted him, did not address the court. Also, a lot of the work was done in respect of other defendants.
21        CL therefore proposed a rather detailed and complicated order on costs which I was not in favour of as costs are usually ordered in the round and I saw no reason to depart from such a practice.
22        I was of the view that although it was not unreasonable for RBG to have raised the s 62(4) issue, much time was spent on this issue. Furthermore, if not for this issue, expert evidence from each side would not have been necessary. Although the trial was concluded within the period fixed, I was of the view that this was not a strong argument as a longer period than necessary was taken for trial partly because of the s 62(4) issue and the use of expert evidence thereon. The s 62(4) issue had caused a significant increase in the length and costs of proceedings.
23        In the circumstances, I was of the view that while CL should not be awarded costs on the s 62(4) issue, there should be a reduction of costs awarded in favour of RBG. In addition, certain specific areas of costs should also be excluded from RBG’s entitlement.
24        Accordingly, looking at costs in the round, I awarded 70% of the costs of RBG’s claim and CL’s counterclaim to RBG on a standard basis up to and including 9 January 2004, being the date of service of the third offer to settle, and 70% of such costs on an indemnity basis from 10 January 2004 up to and including the date of my decision on costs. However, I disallowed RBG the costs of preparing and filing the AEICs of Tay Choon Peng and Clement Paul Danin and Danin’s fees and disbursements.
25        I excluded the costs for preparing Tay’s AEIC because he was not called as a witness and RBG did not contest CL’s submission that such costs be excluded. I should add that I am not suggesting that it is the general rule that a party should be denied the costs of preparing an AEIC for an intended witness who did not in fact give evidence at trial. The omission to call the intended witness to give evidence is but a factor, although the most obvious factor, in the determination whether the costs of preparing his AEIC have been reasonably incurred.
26        I excluded the costs of preparing Danin’s AEIC because it was primarily, if not solely, on the s 62(4) issue. Danin was RBG’s expert.
27        I saw no reason to exclude the costs for preparing the AEIC of Kon Yin Tong or to reduce the costs for preparing Malcolm Shierson’s AEIC, beyond the 70% figure already mentioned.
28        As regards the existing offers to settle, the Court of Appeal said in 
Neo Hock
 
Pheng
 (
supra
 [18])at [24]:
The date the offer to settle is made is singled out as one of the factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the court’s discretion whether to award costs on the indemnity basis or not when an offer is not accepted. This is significant.  Clearly the lesser time the party receiving the offer is given to consider whether to accept it or not is a material factor in deciding whether the offer was a genuine offer to settle or whether it was made with a view to pressurising or coercing the other party to settle. We have no doubt that an offer to settle made barely five days before the commencement of the trials falls into the latter category and would disentitle the party making the offer, the third respondents in this case, to an order for costs on the indemnity basis.
However, it must be borne in mind that in that case, the offer to settle was made five days before the date of commencement of trial and nine days before the claim was disposed of. Accordingly, the offeree did not have 14 days to consider the offer before the claim was disposed of. The Court of Appeal did not lay down a general rule that an offer to settle made before or even after the commencement of trial would be considered as one which is not genuine. Indeed, CL did not suggest that 
Neo Hock
 
Pheng
 amounted to such a general rule. It would depend on the circumstances.
29        As for the point that an offer to settle may put pressure on an offeree, I was of the view that the purpose of such an offer was indeed to put pressure on an offeree. The real question was whether the purpose of an offer was to put such pressure on an offeree as not to amount to a serious and genuine offer to settle.
30        In the case before me, I was of the view that the pressure was not illegitimate. I also did not accept that CL had inadequate time to consider the third offer. The terms thereof were simple enough. Although the second offer was technically incomplete, its effect was clear. If CL were to discontinue its counterclaim for the same metals as RBG was claiming, it would follow that CL’s defence to RBG’s claim would be withdrawn too and RBG would then be entitled to judgment on its claim. By the time the third offer to settle was served, which specifically stated that CL was also to withdraw its defence to the metals in the warehouses, CL could not have been completely surprised by its terms although there was also an additional $100,000 included in the third offer. Furthermore, CL did have 14 days from the date of service of the third offer to consider the same.
31        As for the operative date when indemnity costs should run, I was initially of the view that it was artificial to expect an offeree to accept an earlier offer when an obviously better offer is made subsequently.  Accordingly, it seemed to me that the third offer had superseded the second offer, even if the second offer were complete in terms.  However, upon further consideration, I was of the view that while it was not realistic to expect an offeree to accept an initial and less advantageous offer, it did not necessarily follow that an offeror should be deprived of the advantage of the earlier offer.
32        Accordingly, I agreed with the views expressed by Kan J in 
LK Ang Construction
 (
supra
 [12]) that, in the context of the costs regime, an earlier offer should not be deemed withdrawn. Otherwise, the effect will be to discourage an offeror from improving on what may already be a reasonable, or even generous, offer. An offeror should be encouraged to improve his offer so long as the process is not abused by multiple offers, each of which is not genuine in the sense I have mentioned.
33        However, as the second offer was technically incomplete, I was of the view that RBG should have the benefit of indemnity costs from the date of service of the third offer.
34        As regards the question of a certification of costs for two counsel, I recalled that Mr Quek had informed me that Mr Gill SC was instructed to be lead counsel because the other defendants who had reached a settlement with RBG had wanted this. There was no suggestion then that the case was so novel or complex that only two counsel could represent RBG.
35        I was of the view that while the scenario was initially complicated by the claims of other defendants, it had become a relatively straightforward battle between RBG and CL after the other defendants dropped out. The s 20A issue was novel but not particularly complex.
36        As RBG had not succeeded on the issue of s 62(4), it did not lie in its mouth to suggest that because this issue was novel and complex, it should be granted a certification of costs for two counsel.
37        In the circumstances, I declined to grant such a certification.
38        There was no dispute that RBG’s costs should not include costs incurred solely in respect of a claim by any other defendant and I so ordered, for the avoidance of doubt.
Interest
39        In the light of my finding that RBG had succeeded on its claim for CL’s conversion of nickel briquettes, I had ordered CL to pay damages being the net purchase price or prices which CL had obtained for the briquettes. The parties were able to agree on the quantum of the same, leaving the question of interest to be paid thereon to be decided by me. On such interest, there were two sub-issues if interest were ordered to be paid: the period for which interest should be paid and the rate of interest.
40        RBG suggested various starting dates for the interest period:
(a)        9 May 2002. This was the date when CL took delivery of the nickel briquettes and was considered to be the date of conversion.
(b)        17 June 2002. This date was the last of three dates when CL sold the nickel briquettes.
(c)        13 December 2002. This was the date when RBG’s claim for the nickel briquettes was filed as an amendment to its statement of claim.
RBG obviously wanted interest to run from as early a date as possible whereas CL wanted no interest to be payable, suggesting that no interest should be payable on a conversion claim. If interest were to be paid, CL obviously wanted it to run from a date as late as possible. CL submitted that interest should run from the last date of the sale of other metals by RBG’s liquidators. These other metals had remained in the warehouses until the liquidators sold them. CL’s argument was that RBG would not have received the sale proceeds from the sale of the nickel briquettes earlier than when the other metals were sold by RBG’s liquidators. In response, RBG submitted that there was some delay in the sale of other metals because of other disputes and it was speculative to say when the sale of the nickel briquettes would have been achieved if CL had not converted the same.
41        As regards the rate of interest, RBG sought 6% per annum although it acknowledged that the sale proceeds of the other metals were deposited in a fixed deposit US$ account. CL’s position was that the deposit rates for US$ would be less than 6% per annum. However, no specific rate was mentioned at the time I was receiving submissions as to the question of interest which CL should pay. I rejected a late attempt by CL to adduce evidence on the US$ deposit rate. RBG also did not provide the rate for the same, although it did not dispute that it would be less than 6% per annum. On the other hand, CL also did not say how CL had used the funds from the sale proceeds of the nickel briquettes.
42        I was of the view that since the nickel briquettes had been sold, and CL had received the net sale proceeds, which would otherwise have been received by RBG, interest should be payable by CL.
43        As for the date when interest was to accrue, the two logical dates from the dates proposed in submissions would be the date when CL sold the nickel briquettes or the date when the liquidators would have sold the nickel briquettes if not for the conversion. On the latter date, I assumed that it would be one of the dates during the period from 25 October 2002 to 19 April 2003, mentioned to me as the period when the other metals were sold by the liquidators.
44        To choose either of the two competing dates would result in a larger windfall for one side. The date of last sale by CL, 
ie
   17 June 2002, would reduce CL’s windfall but, on the other hand, it would more than compensate RBG for its loss as its liquidators were unlikely to have sold the nickel briquettes by 17 June 2002. RBG was put into compulsory liquidation in England only on 12 June 2002 and the sale of the other metals by the liquidators commenced only from 25 October 2002. On the other hand, if interest were to accrue from, say, 25 October 2002 only, then CL would have a larger windfall since it had received the sale proceeds about four months earlier.
45        The rate of interest would also affect the considerations of windfall and the extent thereof.
46        In trying to minimise the windfall to either side, I decided that CL was to pay interest on the agreed quantum from the date of last sale by CL, 
ie
 17 June 2002, to the date of my decision on interest, 
ie
 4 August 2004, at the rate of 3% per annum.
47        There remained one minor issue regarding interest.  RBG had to pay the sale proceeds of one drum of nickel to CL pursuant to my judgment of 17 June 2004. By that, I meant the net sale proceeds. I was informed that the principal sum thereof was a small sum of around US$2,000. RBG reminded me that under orders for appointment of provisional liquidators and for the winding up of RBG in Singapore and the appointment of liquidators, various orders were made allowing the liquidators to sell metals in the warehouses and to place the gross sale proceeds in a US$ fixed deposit account to earn interest. The expenses of the survey and sale, as well as of any liens, were to be deducted from the gross sale proceeds. These orders were made with the knowledge of CL and other defendants. Accordingly, I ordered RBG to pay CL whatever interest was earned on the net sale proceeds of that one drum of nickel.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant, J Ravinthiran, was convicted in the District Court on a charge of causing grievous hurt under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the PC”). He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane: see 
PP v J Ravinthiran
 
[2004] SGDC 72
. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. For the purpose of the appeal against conviction, the appellant filed a criminal motion seeking to adduce additional evidence. I dismissed the criminal motion and both appeals. I now give my reasons.
Facts
2          In the District Court, the amended charge against the appellant read as follows:
You, J Ravinthiran, male 35 years old NRIC No: S1831449E are charged that you, on or about the 6th day of July 2003 at about 4.25 am, along Serangoon Road near the junction of Desker Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Mohamed Alias Bin Mohamed Hanifah, male 32 years old, by means of an instrument, which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, to wit, by using motor vehicle bearing registration number SCH 2839 G to knock down the said Mohamed Alias Bin Mohamed Hanifah and thereby causing a fracture of the left skull, and have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 326 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The appellant was originally charged together with six other persons under s 326 read with s 34 of the PC. On the first day of trial, these six persons were all granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (“DNAQ”), and so the trial against the appellant proceeded on the charge set out above.
The case for the Prosecution
3          The Prosecution alleged that at about 4.25am on 6 July 2003, the appellant deliberately struck the victim with a vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla with registration no SCH 2839 G (“the car”), thereby causing the victim to suffer a fractured skull, among other injuries. It was not disputed that the appellant was the registered owner of the car at the material time.
4          The Prosecution’s case rested primarily on the evidence of PW1, Lim Hee Mong, and PW2, Peck Cher Guan, two taxi drivers who witnessed the incident giving rise to the charge.
5          PW1 testified that at about 4.00am on the day in question, he had picked up a passenger from Geylang who wished to go to Desker Road. PW1 stopped his taxi on the left-hand side of Desker Road, near the junction with Serangoon Road. PW1 noticed a group of Indian men quarrelling on Serangoon Road. Some of them were armed with weapons. Then, a red car pulled up to his right. He identified the red car as the appellant’s car.
6          PW1 turned to look at the group of people in the car through the window of this taxi, which was wound down. There were four men and one woman in the car. They included the driver, a man in a red T-shirt. PW1 heard the men in the car shouting in Tamil to the group on Serangoon Road. He saw two persons from the group on Serangoon Road pull a man on to the second lane of Serangoon Road. They left him there, and returned to the pavement. The man being pulled was unsteady and appeared to have taken some alcohol. Then, the car swiftly moved across the road, hitting the man. PW1 saw the car’s brake lights glowing just as it was about to hit the man. The car struck the man on the lower left side of his back. Two men came out of the car. They pulled the injured man to the first lane of Serangoon Road. The car reversed a little, then turned off toward Syed Alwi Road. PW1 took down the car’s licence plate registration number. He then reported the incident at Rochor Neighbourhood Police Post.
7          PW2 testified that he had been plying Serangoon Road for passengers at the material time. He saw a group of five to six Indian persons along the left side of Serangoon Road. They were waving and gesticulating so he stopped his taxi, thinking that they were hailing it. No one responded. He moved his taxi forward, stopping it just beyond Roberts Lane, about five to six car-lengths away. When he looked back over his left shoulder, he noticed some people struggling. There was screaming and shouting.
8          Suddenly, someone was pushed to the ground on all fours. Then PW2 saw a red Toyota, which he identified as the appellant’s car, coming across the road. PW2 noted that the car came out of Desker Road, cut across all four lanes of Serangoon Road, and struck the person who had been pushed to the ground. The front portion of the car, where the license plate was, struck the crown of the person’s head. A man alighted from the front passenger side, looked at the victim, and left with the others in the car. PW2 took down the car’s licence plate number and reported the incident to the police.
9          PW3 was the victim himself, but he was unable to recall much of what happened. He testified that he was still suffering from fits, giddiness and amnesia as a result of his head injury. However, he stated that he did not know the appellant. PW4 was one Dr Pang Boon Chuan, the doctor who prepared the victim’s medical report. He testified that the victim’s blood alcohol level at the material time was 196mg per 100ml. He also stated that the victim’s injuries were consistent with the skull being hit with a forceful blow from a blunt object, such as a bat or hammer, or with being hit by a car in the manner described by PW2.
10        PW5, Sgt Mohamed Ameer bin Mohamed Hanifah, and PW6, Sgt Hirlie Haslee bin Ramli, were police officers from Rochor Neighbourhood Police Post. PW5 responded to a call at about 4.30am, and eventually found the car in a parking lot along Syed Alwi Road. He noted cracks on the front windshield and water on the front of the car. He followed the trail of water droplets up a staircase to the appellant’s office. The appellant answered the door. PW5 took the appellant back to the police station.
11        PW6 was on counter duty when a taxi driver informed him of the incident at about 4.30am. The taxi driver gave him the licence plate number of the car. PW6 rushed to the scene of the crime. The victim was lying on Serangoon Road, near the double yellow line. PW6 tried to establish eyewitness particulars without much success. He was also unable to recover any weapons or exhibits. However, DNA analysis later confirmed that a trace amount of human blood found at the front bumper and number plate region of the appellant’s car matched that of the victim.
The Defence
12        The appellant’s defence was that he simply did not cause the victim’s injuries. He did not know the victim. Instead, the injuries were caused by a crowbar swung by one Mark Sivaraj (“Sivaraj”), one of the six persons granted a DNAQ on the first day of trial. The Defence called just two witnesses. The first witness was the appellant himself. The second witness was Balakrishnan s/o Vasudevan (“Bala”), one of the appellant’s employees. Sivaraj was not called to testify.
13        The appellant did not deny that he was present at the scene at the material time. He testified that he had been driving back to his office from a coffee shop called Raja’s BBQ. His fiancée, one Alexander Margaret (“Margaret”), was in the front passenger seat. Three of his employees, including Bala, were in the back. As the appellant reached the junction of Desker Road and Serangoon Road, he saw some friends on the opposite side of Serangoon Road. One of these friends was Sivaraj. There were two other persons with them who were not known to the appellant. One was walking along the road, carrying a crowbar over his left shoulder. According to the appellant, this person was the victim.
14        The appellant drove diagonally across Serangoon Road, and jammed on his brakes when he reached the second lane. He claimed that he had cut across Serangoon Road to “say hi” to Sivaraj. During cross-examination, however, the appellant admitted that he had in fact already seen Sivaraj twice that evening: once at a pub called BMW Music Lounge, and once at Raja’s BBQ.
15        The appellant told Bala to stop the victim from hurting anyone, presumably with the crowbar. By the time Bala alighted, the victim was already swinging it at Sivaraj. Sivaraj ducked, grabbed the crowbar, swung it and hit the victim above his left ear.
16        As the victim fell, the appellant reversed as he “didn’t want him to fall on [his] car.” Someone tapped on his bonnet because he did not manage to clear the victim. Bala told him that the victim was losing a lot of blood. The appellant advised Bala to call an ambulance. The appellant’s explanation for the DNA evidence on his car was that the victim had fallen very near to his car, and had blood pouring from him. Therefore, it was possible that some of it might have spilled on to his car. The appellant then drove back to his office.
17        Bala gave largely the same version of events. He added that he walked to a nearby 7-Eleven store to call an ambulance. He chose not to use his mobile telephone to do so because he “didn’t want to be questioned by many people.” He told the 995 operator that “there was a guy knocked down along Serangoon Road”, and gave his name as “Chris”. Bala was also one of the six granted a DNAQ at the beginning of the trial.
18        Both the appellant and Bala gave evidence in court that materially contradicted their statements to the police. The contradiction pertained to whether Bala had alighted from the car before or after the incident took place. In their statements, both the appellant and Bala maintained that it was after the incident. Yet in court both claimed that he had done so 
before
 the incident. As for the police statements, both claimed to have been either confused, or to be “simplifying” the facts for the recorder.
19        The day after closing submissions were made, Defence counsel tendered further written submissions. Counsel argued that the district judge should draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution under illustration (g) of s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) for failing to call Sivaraj.
The decision below
20        The district judge found PW1 and PW2 to be credible witnesses. They were both independent witnesses, unknown to any of the parties involved. PW2’s evidence was corroborated by the objective DNA findings. The district judge accepted that PW1 may have simply been mistaken about the point of impact between the victim and the car. There was also no reason to reject the evidence of the remaining Prosecution witnesses, which the Defence did not challenge.
21        In contrast, the district judge found the appellant to be an unreliable witness. Having observed his demeanour in court, and the manner in which he conducted his defence, the district judge was satisfied that he “would resort to any means to exonerate himself”. He found the appellant’s explanation for his presence at the scene of the crime to be “simply unbelievable”. As for Bala, he was an interested witness because he was the appellant’s employee. The district judge did not accept the appellant’s explanation for the inconsistency between his oral evidence and his police statements, and noted that Bala had been similarly unable to explain it away.
22        The district judge refused to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for failing to call Sivaraj. The deputy public prosecutor (“DPP”) had indicated that Sivaraj had not been summoned because the Prosecution did not require him. There had been nothing to stop the appellant from calling Sivaraj to testify, especially since he had been available on the first day of the trial.
23        As to the question of sentence, the district judge took a serious view of the appellant’s offence. There were several aggravating features. The victim had sustained serious injuries. The appellant had used a car as a weapon, and was completely unremorseful. He also had two prior convictions for disorderly behaviour and a third for causing grievous hurt. In the circumstances, the district judge sentenced the appellant to four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
The criminal motion
24        Before I turn to the appeals against conviction and sentence, I shall deal briefly with the criminal motion by which the appellant sought to have additional evidence admitted for the purpose of the appeal against conviction. I dismissed the criminal motion for the following reasons.
25       
 The evidence that the appellant sought to admit consisted of six affidavits (“the new evidence”) affirmed by the appellant, Bala, Margaret, an acquaintance of the appellant’s and two apparently-independent eyewitnesses. From a perusal of the new evidence, it appeared that the appellant sought to have it admitted to show that:
(a)        Sivaraj struck the victim with a crowbar, while the appellant’s car never hit the victim; and
(b)        Sivaraj admitted after the incident that he had hit the victim with a crowbar.
26        The principles governing the admission of fresh evidence on appeal are well-settled. Three cumulative conditions must be satisfied to have the evidence admitted: 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 at 343, [13]–[14]. First, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial (“non-availability”). Second, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive (“relevance”). Third, the evidence must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible (“reliability”).
27        I should first address a point raised by the Prosecution in its written submissions. It was said that the claims made in the new evidence that Sivaraj admitted hitting the victim with the crowbar are hearsay evidence, and therefore irrelevant and inadmissible. I was unable to agree with the Prosecution’s contention. Although the evidence was technically hearsay, it was nonetheless admissible by virtue of s 32(c) of the Evidence Act, which provides that such statements are relevant facts
when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages.
This was precisely the situation in the appeal before me. As such, I was of the view that the new evidence satisfied the second condition, that of relevance.
28        However, it was an entirely different matter when the first and third conditions came to be considered. Before me, counsel for the appellant readily conceded that the first condition, that of non-availability, was clearly not satisfied. It was also doubtful whether the evidence was reliable. All six accounts given in the affidavits were certainly consistent with each other. However, they contradicted the evidence given at the trial by the two taxi drivers who witnessed the incident, and who were found to be credible by the district judge. They also contradicted objective DNA evidence that matched traces of blood on the appellant’s car with that of the victim. Therefore, I was of the opinion that the new evidence was not even apparently credible on its face.
29        Notwithstanding all this, counsel for the appellant sought to argue that the evidence should nevertheless be admitted “in the interests of justice”: 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
. However, counsel gave no compelling reason why this was a case in which “the interests of justice” could only be served by admitting the new evidence, and seemed content to allow his bare assertion to speak for itself. I must emphasise that the exception in 
Chia Kah Boon
, as stated at [9] of the decision, citing 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
 at [10], is
a 
narrow
 exception and is warranted only by the 
most extenuating circumstances
, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced is 
highly cogent and pertinent
 and the strength of which renders the conviction unsafe. [emphasis added]
As such, in the absence of any supporting reasons to show how the appellant’s case came within this narrow exception, I could not admit the new evidence “in the interests of justice”. I therefore dismissed the criminal motion accordingly.
The appeal against conviction
30        The appellant raised a plethora of arguments in support of his appeal against conviction. The gist of these arguments may be summarised thus:
(a)        the district judge erred in law by refusing to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution for failing to call Sivaraj and one SI Gafoor as witnesses; and
(b)        the district judge erred in fact by preferring the Prosecution’s version of events over that given by the Defence.
Whether the district judge erred in law by refusing to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution
31        The appellant argued that the Prosecution ought to have called Sivaraj as well as one SI Gafoor, a police officer attached to Central Division who was apparently present at the scene of the crime taking down eyewitness particulars.
Applicable Principles
32       
 The principles governing the drawing of adverse inferences are not controversial. Section 116 of the Evidence Act reads:
The court 
may
 presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case. [emphasis added]
Illustration (g) to that provision provides that a court may presume “that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it”. In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 at 523, [73], I held that
[s]uch arguments are commonly made. Commonly too, such arguments are without merit. The court must hesitate to draw any such presumption unless the witness not produced is 
essential
 to the prosecution’s case. Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. 
All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
 Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution. [emphasis added]
33        In 
Khua Kian Keong v PP
 
[2003] 4 SLR 526
 at [34], a case relied on by the Prosecution as well as the district judge, I summarised the principles governing the exercise of the court’s discretion under illustration (g) of s 116 as follows:
Clearly this is a discretionary and not a mandatory inference: 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
, 
Chia Sze Chang v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 523
 and 
Satli bin Masot
 [
v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 637
]. The appellate court has to evaluate if the trial judge had exercised his discretion correctly. Strict criteria have been stipulated before this adverse inference can be drawn against the Prosecution, namely that:
(a)        the witness not offered was a material one: 
Chua Keem Long
, 
Lau Song Seng v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 663
 followed by 
Satli bin Masot
;
(b)        the Prosecution was withholding evidence which it possessed and which was available: 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 [
[2004] 2 SLR 474
] and 
Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 617
; and
(c)        this was done with an ulterior motive to hinder or hamper the Defence: 
Ang Jwee Herng
, 
Wong Leong Chin v PP
 
[2001] 1 SLR 146
 and 
Chia Sze Chang
.
SI Gafoor
34       
 I deal with SI Gafoor first, since this point may be easily disposed of. SI Gafoor is referred to in the evidence of PW5, the police sergeant who found the car in the parking lot on Syed Alwi Road and subsequently brought the appellant back to the police station. According to PW5, it was SI Gafoor who told him that certain eyewitnesses had stated that the appellant was the driver of the car who hit the victim.
35        
While the admissibility of these statements in evidence was questionable since they were, strictly speaking, hearsay, it was clear that no adverse inference could be drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call SI Gafoor. First, given that the Prosecution were able to produce the two taxi drivers to give direct eyewitness accounts of the incident, as well as objective DNA evidence establishing that the victim had come into contact with the appellant’s car, SI Gafoor was by no means a material witness.
36        Second, even if I were minded to hold that he was a material witness, the Defence did not raise the issue of SI Gafoor’s absence at any time during the trial below, nor during closing submissions. The Prosecution contended that no adverse inference can be drawn in such circumstances, relying on the Malaysian case of 
Yong Moi Sin v Kerajaan Malaysia
 
[2000] 1 MLJ 35
. This was a case from the Johor Bahru High Court in which the Malaysian equivalent of our illustration (g) of s 116 was considered. Drawing from Indian authorities, the Johor Bahru High Court held at 54 that “no inference should be drawn against a party for not producing a material witness where the question of the absence of such witness was not raised at the trial at all.” In my judgment, there is no reason why this principle should not similarly apply here. If the Defence was of the opinion that SI Gafoor was not material in the court below, as one may fairly surmise by their silence on the issue, it was difficult to see why he should suddenly become a material witness on appeal.
Sivaraj
37        In relation to Sivaraj, the appellant contended that, given the Defence witnesses’ testimony that a crowbar was used to inflict the victim’s injuries, it was then “incumbent” on the Prosecution to produce Sivaraj as a “key rebuttal witness” to substantiate their version of events, in which no crowbar was used.
38        I found no merit in this argument. Sivaraj was not a material Prosecution witness. In fact, the district judge noted in his grounds of decision at [29] that the DPP had indicated that the Prosecution would not be calling Sivaraj because they simply “did not require him.” The Prosecution had sufficient evidence in support of its positive case: that the victim had been pushed on to Serangoon Road by two other men, and that the appellant had then driven his car across Serangoon Road, hitting the victim’s head with the front portion of his car. I noted further that Sivaraj’s non-appearance was only raised by the Defence in written submissions tendered 
after
 the close of the trial, and 
after
 closing submissions had been delivered in court. I therefore found that the district judge was correct to have refused to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for its failure to call Sivaraj at the trial.
39        I did not, however, agree with the Prosecution that an adverse inference should instead be drawn against the Defence for its own failure to call Sivaraj. It is certainly not in dispute that an adverse inference may be drawn against the Defence in certain circumstances. The Prosecution relied on 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 789
 and 
PP v Nurashikin bte Ahmad Borhan
 
[2003] 1 SLR 52
 in support of its argument.
40        In 
Nurashikin
, the accused was charged with shoplifting while she was with her friend, one Natasha. Her defence was that the items shoplifted could have dropped into her bag accidentally, or that someone else could have put them there. Since the only other person who could have put them in her bag was Natasha, I found that an adverse inference ought to have been drawn against the accused for her failure to call Natasha to give evidence at the trial.
41        However, in 
Loo See Mei v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 27
 at [54], I also cautioned that
it is not in every case that an accused person’s failure to call on a witness results in an adverse inference being drawn against him or her. Much depends on the facts and circumstances [of] each case. There are various factors to take into account, some of which include the availability of the witness, the purpose for which the witness is to be called and the materiality of calling that witness. These factors are, of course, non-exhaustive.
I then clarified the applicability of 
Nurashikin
 as follows:
In 
Nurashikin
’s case, the materiality of calling Natasha was obvious: by a deduction of logic, if what the respondent there said was true, it would go towards exculpating the respondent. The same cannot be said of the appellant’s failure to call on the other immigration offenders in the present appeal. Without casting aspersions on her previous counsel’s conduct of her defence, perhaps more could have been done in contacting these immigration offenders which were offered to her. Be that as it may, one cannot logically deduce that the immigration offenders would have come forward to corroborate her story. 
Calling on the other immigration offenders was, in short, not the
 only 
way to rebut the Prosecution’s case.
 … Bearing these in mind, I found that the trial judge was correct in stopping short of drawing an adverse inference against the appellant by finding that it merely created a serious gap in her defence. [emphasis added]
42        These considerations applied squarely in the present appeal. First, it was not at all clear that Sivaraj would have corroborated the appellant’s version of what happened on Serangoon Road that morning. Indeed, had he done so, he would have laid himself open to prosecution since he had only been granted a DNAQ rather than a full acquittal. Second, it was perfectly open to the appellant to meet the Prosecution’s case by proffering his own version of events, as supported by his own evidence and that of Bala. Whether or not the evidence given by him and Bala was cogent and persuasive is, of course, a wholly separate matter. The point is that calling Sivaraj was not the only way to rebut the Prosecution’s case. As such, 
Nurashikin
 is distinguishable and no adverse inference should be drawn against the Defence. At best, the omission merely created a serious gap in the case for the Defence.
Whether the district judge erred in fact by preferring the Prosecution’s version of events over that given by the Defence
43        Before I turn to consider the appellant’s specific arguments, it would be useful to briefly revisit the principles governing the appellate court’s power to interfere with findings of fact made by the trial judge. In 
Ramis a/l Muniandy v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 534
, the Court of Appeal held at [31]:
The principles governing the role of an appellate court in reviewing a trial judge’s findings of fact are settled. It is clear that an appellate court will not easily disturb findings of fact unless they are 
clearly reached against the weight of evidence
 (see 
eg Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 and 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
). The appellate court will be 
particularly slow
 to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact where they hinge on the trial judge’s 
assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses
, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence (see 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 and 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
). [emphasis added]
In the light of this established rule, I noted at the outset that the district judge’s grounds of decision in this case clearly demonstrated that the credibility and veracity of the witnesses before him were crucial to the findings of fact now sought to be overturned. Bearing these considerations in mind, I now turn to the arguments raised before me.
44        As mentioned earlier, the appellant put forth a multitude of contentions to dispute the district judge’s preference for the Prosecution’s version of events over that given by the Defence. In essence, the appellant argued that the district judge erred in failing to consider that:
(a)        he ought not to have believed PW1 and PW2;
(b)        no other evidence was adduced to support their accounts of the incident;
(c)        the appellant had no motive to commit the offence;
(d)        the victim’s evidence made little sense; and
(e)        there was sufficient evidence to show that a crowbar was used to inflict the victim’s injuries.
45        I shall deal with points (a) and (b) together since they both pertain to the cogency of the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, the two taxi drivers who witnessed the incident. In my view, there was no merit whatsoever in the appellant’s arguments. The district judge was decidedly of the view that these two witnesses were honest and truthful and had no reason at all to lie to the court, since they were wholly independent witnesses unrelated to any of the parties involved. 
46        I took special notice of the fact that the district judge was also mindful of PW1’s statement that the victim was hit on his back, when the injury was in fact to his head. The district judge accepted this as an honest mistake, which he was perfectly entitled to do: 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
. The taxi drivers’ accounts were corroborated by the DNA evidence, which incontrovertibly showed the presence of the victim’s blood on the front centre portion of the appellant’s car. It was difficult to see what other corroboration the appellant required, and the sort of evidence that the appellant said should have been adduced was entirely speculative in nature. For example, it was the appellant’s position that if the victim had really been hit by his car, then he would have been flung forward after impact. As the DPP pointed out, this was simply pure conjecture.
47        Next, I turn to point (c). The DPP rightly pointed out that there is no burden on the Prosecution to show motive. The Prosecution merely has to prove the 
actus reus
 and 
mens rea
 of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, and 
mens rea
 does not by any means equate to motive. While the presence of a motive may militate in favour of a finding of 
mens rea
, the absence of motive does not necessarily equate to an absence of 
mens rea

 at 394, [26]. The appellant then went on to make the rather startling assertion that it made no sense for him to have knocked the victim down with his car, considering that the appellant’s car was next to PW1’s taxi. It would have been obvious to the appellant, so the argument goes, that the taxi driver would witness the entire incident. I failed to see how this assisted the appellant at all. It was not my task to deduce why he acted in a certain manner, or why he acted in such a way given that he was in full sight of eyewitnesses.
48        Point (d) also afforded very little assistance to the appellant in the light of the independent eyewitness testimony and the objective DNA evidence. The victim was able to say that he was at the scene of the crime at the material time, and there was certainly no doubt that he suffered the injuries for which the appellant was charged. Indeed, the after-effects of those very injuries were still manifest in court when he came to testify, which is precisely the reason he was unable to recall the incident in detail.
49        As for point (e), the appellant appeared to be relying on the medical evidence given by PW4, Dr Pang, and that of the Defence witnesses – himself and his employee, Bala. PW4’s evidence did not assist the appellant either way. What PW4 said was that the victim’s injuries were consistent 
either
 with being hit by a car in the manner described by the two taxi drivers, 
or
 with being hit by a blunt object. As for the evidence given by the appellant and Bala, it need not be emphasised again that the district judge found that neither witness was to be believed. Their accounts were also inherently incredible, and inconsistent with their statements to the police and with the DNA evidence. In short, the appellant would have me believe that:
(a)        he drove diagonally across three lanes of Serangoon Road from neighbouring Desker Road in order to “say hi” to Sivaraj, whom he had already seen twice that same evening; and
(b)        the victim’s blood found on his car came to be there because he happened to position his car precisely where the victim fell as a result of a blow inflicted by a crowbar wielded by Sivaraj.
This was surely absurd. Needless to say, I saw absolutely no basis for me to interfere with the district judge’s findings of fact in this regard.
The appeal against sentence
50        Before me, the appellant raised no specific grounds in support of his appeal against sentence. However, for the sake of completeness, I shall deal with the question very briefly.
51        It is well-established that an appellate court may only interfere with the sentence meted out by the trial judge if it is satisfied that:
(a)        the trial judge made the wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence;
(b)        the trial judge erred in appreciating the material before him;
(c)        the sentence was wrong in principle; or
(d)        the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, or manifestly inadequate, as the case may be.
This is trite law, as set out in 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
[1986] SLR 126
 and recently reiterated in 
Ong Ah Tiong v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 587
 at [10].
52        The offence under s 326 of the PC is punishable with imprisonment for life, or a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment with fine or caning. In this case, the district judge sentenced the appellant to four years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane.
53        The DPP brought a number of sentencing precedents to my attention in his written submissions. Without going through each case in detail, what may be gleaned from those precedents is that the sentencing norm for offences under s 326 averages two and a half to four years’ imprisonment, with nine to 12 strokes of the cane. The weapons used in those cases included a knife, a mug of boiling water and a chopper. Not all the injuries were inflicted on vital areas such as the chest or head. Also, not all of the offenders had antecedents. Some had pleaded guilty.
54        In the light of those precedents, I was firmly of the view that it could not possibly be said that the sentence imposed in this case was manifestly excessive. The appellant had two prior convictions for disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed), and one for causing grievous hurt by a rash act under s 338 of the PC. In my judgment, the use of a motor vehicle was also a critical aggravating factor. The appellant deliberately used his vehicle to endanger the life of another person, and it was perhaps fortunate that the incident occurred in the early hours of the morning while few other members of the public were also on the road. It therefore did not surprise me that the district judge agreed to impose a deterrent sentence on the appellant.
Conclusion
55        For these reasons, I dismissed both the appeals against conviction and sentence. I affirmed the sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane imposed on the appellant by the district judge.

13 August 2004
 
Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant, Lau Khee Leong, was tried and convicted in the District Court on four charges of abetting the making of false statements in employment pass applications submitted to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). This constituted an offence under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), and was punishable under s 57(1)(iv) of the Act. The district judge sentenced the appellant to three weeks’ imprisonment on each charge, and ordered two of the sentences to run consecutively. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed both appeals, and now give my reasons.
 
 
 
 
The background facts
2          At all material times, the appellant was a licensed employment agent and the sole proprietor of Heavenly Employment Agency. Sometime in July and August 2000, the appellant helped to complete and submit to MOM employment pass application forms (“Form 8 EP Applications”) in respect of four nationals from the People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”), namely, Fang Qing Rong (“Fang”), Liu Kong Shou (Liu”), Chen Chun Xiang (“Chen”) and Xue Liang Song (“Xue”). These workers had been invited by MOM to convert their three‑year work permits, which were about to expire, into employment passes, provided that they remained in the employment of their respective local sponsor employers.
3          The Form 8 EP Applications stated that the local sponsor employer for Fang, Liu and Chen was Aquatic World Building Contractors Pte Ltd (“Aquatic”), while that for Xue was Eng Thye Shing Construction Pte Ltd (“ETS”). On the basis of the information and declarations provided in the application forms, MOM issued employment passes to the four foreign workers. However, it later transpired that the workers had never been employed by Aquatic or ETS but had been freelancing, and that they continued to work for various other construction companies after obtaining the employment passes. 
4          The appellant was subsequently charged with abetting three of the workers (Fang, Liu, Chen) and the director of ETS, one Teh Char Lay (in respect of Xue’s employment pass application), in providing false statements in the Form 8 EP Applications. The charges against the appellant read:
The first charge
[T]hat you on or about 28.08.2000, did abet one Teh Char Lay … in the commission of the offence of making a false statement in an Application for an Employment Pass “Form 8” received by the Employment Pass Department on 28.08.2000, to obtain an Employment Pass for one Xue Liang Song; … to wit, you intentionally aided the said Teh Char Lay to arrange the said Form 8 application wherein was stated that the said Xue Liang Song would be employed by Eng Thye Shing Construction Pte Ltd …, a statement which you knew to be false, and on the basis of this false statement, an Employment Pass was issued to the foreigner on 14.10.2000, and which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), punishable under Section 57(1)(iv) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).
The second charge
[T]hat you on or about 20.07.2000, did abet one Fang Qing Rong … in the commission of the offence of making a false statement in an Application for an Employment Pass “Form 8” received by the Employment Pass Department on 20.07.2000, to obtain an Employment Pass for him; to wit, you intentionally aided the said Fang Qing Rong to arrange the said Form 8 application wherein was stated that he would be employed by Aquatic World Building Contractors Pte Ltd …, a statement which you knew to be false, and on the basis of this false statement, an Employment pass was issued to the foreigner on 22.08.2000, and which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), punishable under Section 57(1)(iv) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).
The third and fourth charges were the same as the second charge in all material aspects, except that they related to the employment passes for Liu and Chen respectively. 
The case for the Prosecution
5          It was not disputed that the workers did not work for Aquatic or ETS during the time they held the work permits and the employment passes. They sought their own employment and held no permanent jobs. 
6          Consequently, the Prosecution’s case was essentially this: that the appellant was fully aware, at the time he assisted the three workers and the director of ETS in filling up and submitting the Form 8 EP Applications, that the sponsoring companies would not actually be employing the workers. 
Evidence of the foreign workers
7          The Prosecution principally relied on the evidence of Fang, Chen, Liu and Xue to establish its case. On the whole, their evidence was essentially the same, except for some minor details that were peculiar to each witness. Conditioned statements of the four workers were admitted as evidence (Exhibits “PS 1” to “PS 4”) under s 371 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). 
8          The workers testified that they were all on three‑year work permits from 1997 to 2000. Fang, Chen and Liu held work permits to work for Aquatic, while Xue held a work permit to work for ETS.
9          In mid-1997, they were introduced to an employment agent, one Li Yu Pei (“Li”). Li approached them individually and offered to help them change their respective employers after the expiry of their first work permits in 1997. All four agreed, as they hoped to find better-paying jobs. Li told them that they could seek employment for themselves after the work permits were approved. In exchange for arranging their work permit applications, the workers agreed to pay Li “application fees” for the period that they held the work permits. Fang agreed to pay Li $7,000, while Chen and Liu both agreed to pay $4,500. In addition, Chen and Liu also promised to pay Li “management fees” of $150 per month. Xue also testified to paying a certain sum of money to Li as “management fees” every six months, but he could not recall the exact amount he paid each time.
10        Sometime in 1998, the workers learned that Li had passed away, leaving his widow behind. One or two months later, the appellant contacted the workers and asked them to go to his office. Chen and Liu went to the appellant’s office together, while Fang and Xue met the appellant on separate occasions.
11        The appellant introduced himself as Li’s partner and the real agent behind Li. He informed the workers that from then onwards they were under his charge, and instructed them to pay him any outstanding agency fees owed to Li. Fang, Liu and Chen believed the appellant and agreed to the arrangement as the appellant knew Li’s name, had their contact numbers, and knew exactly how much they still owed Li.
12        Before the expiry of their work permits in 2000, the appellant met up with the workers to discuss the converting of their work permits to three‑year employment passes. He offered to arrange their employment pass applications for a fee. He asked Fang, Chen and Liu to pay $6,500 each, and also requested them to pay a further $1,000 to $1,100 to extend the expiry date of their passports. Xue was asked to pay $10,000, which sum included the application fee, the fee for the renewal of his passport and management fees. The workers agreed to this arrangement, as they believed that the appellant could otherwise cancel their employment documents and send them back to the PRC. At the meeting, the appellant told the workers that they could continue to seek employment on their own.
13        The appellant presented each worker with a Form 8 EP Application to sign. The appellant helped to fill in their particulars in the forms, as the workers were not conversant with the English language. Fang noticed that the declaration and covenant by the local sponsor under Pt X and Pt IX had already been signed. Subsequently, the workers received their employment passes. 
14        The workers were unequivocal in their evidence that the appellant never informed them that it was illegal for them to work for companies other than the local sponsor employer stated on their employment passes. Furthermore, the appellant knew that they were not working for Aquatic and ETS, but were freelancing for various other companies. They were certain of this, as all of them had contacted the appellant on at least one occasion to seek his assistance in finding employment. Once, Fang asked the appellant if he could work for Aquatic, his official employer. He had hoped to work for Aquatic as his then employer was not paying him. However, the appellant informed him that there was no job for him there. Hence, Fang continued to look for employment on his own. The appellant also told Xue that the employers he knew of only paid low salaries.
15        The appellant also helped Chen and Liu to write at least one letter of recommendation each, to potential employers. Chen was even charged $20 for each letter prepared under the Aquatic letterhead. Occasionally, the appellant would also provide them with telephone numbers of prospective employers for them to approach when they could not find any work on their own. However, the appellant specifically informed Chen not to look for the boss of Aquatic for employment, as the boss was an Indian, and Chen would face problems communicating with him. Based on the above factors, the workers were confident that the appellant knew that they were seeking employment on their own prior to their making their employment pass applications.
16        In 2001, Fang, Chen and Liu were notified by the appellant that their employment passes had been cancelled by the boss of Aquatic, one A Francis Xavier a/l Arokiasamy (“Francis”). Subsequently, the appellant gathered the workers at his office to introduce them to Francis, who then officially told the workers of the cancellation. All three workers testified that this was the first time that they had met Francis. The appellant told the workers that they would have to hand over their passports and employment passes and return to the PRC. 
17        Fang, Chen and Liu were unhappy with the unexpected revocation of their employment passes as the “application fee” that they had paid the appellant was meant to cover a three‑year employment pass, and they had only worked for slightly more than a year. They therefore demanded a refund from the appellant. In the end, the appellant consented to pay Fang the sum of $2000, and Chen and Liu the sum of $1500 each, as compensation. As a condition for the payment, the appellant wanted the three of them to return to the PRC as soon as possible. 
Evidence of Teh Char Lay
18        The Prosecution also called Teh Char Lay (“Teh”) to give evidence. Teh had pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement in the Form 8 EP Application in respect of Xue’s employment by ETS. He had already served his sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment at the time of the appellant’s trial. 
19        Teh testified that he was appointed as a director of ETS in February 2000 on the recommendation of a friend, one Teng Kok Beng (“Teng”). Teng promised to appoint Teh as the manager of an upcoming construction project, and instructed him to apply for work permits for a group of workers.
20        Sometime in March or April 2000, Teh went to the appellant’s office with Teng to sign numerous employment pass applications. Teh had earlier introduced the appellant as the representative of ETS’s employment agent. Teh explained that he agreed to sign the application forms as Teng had assured him that several construction projects were in the pipeline. About four to six month later, Teh signed another batch of employment pass applications, one of which was Xue’s application.
21        Teh was subsequently arrested by MOM for falsely stating in the employment pass application that Xue would be employed by ETS. He pleaded guilty to the charge, and admitted to the statement of facts (“SOF”). The material portions of the SOF revealed that the appellant had arranged with Teh to have Xue’s work permit converted to an employment pass. The appellant completed the said Form 8E Application and Teh signed the form knowing that ETS had no work for Xue. Furthermore, Xue had never worked for ETS whilst he held the work permit and the employment pass. 
22        The circumstances in which the offence took place were further revealed in Teh’s plea of mitigation. Teh’s counsel maintained that the originators of the whole scheme were Teng and the appellant, who had full control of the affairs of ETS. To dissociate themselves from the scam, they did not want to appear as directors of ETS. As a result, Teh became the scapegoat. Thus, both the SOF and the mitigation plea squarely placed the appellant as one of the two masterminds of the scam.
23        However, during the appellant’s trial, Teh told the court an entirely different story which effectively exculpated the appellant. Teh painted both the appellant and himself as unfortunate victims of the scam devised by Teng. Teh testified that Teng had deceived both him and the appellant into thinking that ETS needed workers for upcoming projects. When questioned by the district judge as to why these facts were not stated in the SOF, Teh claimed that the SOF was misleading. He claimed that he had not realised this until later, as he had not been listening to the SOF when it was being read out to him. He had simply wanted to plead guilty at the time as he had hoped that the district judge would mete out a non-custodial sentence. 
24        Teh also tried to explain away the inconsistencies between his evidence in court and his mitigation plea by stating that he may have given his counsel wrong instructions. Teh further claimed that he did not tell the investigators about Teng as he was not asked about him. 
The defence
25        In his defence below, the appellant maintained that he honestly believed that the workers would be working for the respective sponsoring companies (
ie 
 Aquatic and ETS) when he processed their application forms. There were no suspicious circumstances in his dealings with the parties involved, and he had simply presumed that the information provided was true. In any event, he was not required by law to check the truth of the information provided. He had neither the authority nor the time to carry out such investigations.
26        While the appellant did not deny that he had contacted the four workers in question, he averred that he was only helping Li’s widow to collect the debts owed to her late husband. The appellant had agreed to help her as he took pity on her. At the meeting with the workers, he had specifically told them that he was collecting the debts on behalf of the widow and he never introduced himself as Li’s partner.
27        The appellant had no further contact with the workers until they wanted to renew their work permits sometime in 2000. He clarified that none of the workers had sought his help to find employment, and that he had never written any recommendation letters for Chen and Liu. When he subsequently handed over the employment passes to the workers, he had also informed them that it was an offence for them to work for companies other than the sponsoring company. 
28        He had collected the $6,500 application fee from the workers for Francis and Teng at their request. In return, they paid him a commission of $500 to $800 for each successful employment pass application. The appellant explained that as it was illegal for the sponsoring company to deduct the application fees from the workers’ salaries, they often engaged a third party like him to collect the fees.   
The decision of the district judge
29        In the trial below, the main issue was whether the appellant knew that the statements contained in the Form 8 EP Applications were false, and whether he had the requisite intention to abet the principal offence of making a false statement.
30        Having considered the evidence carefully, the district judge found the accounts of Fang, Chen, Liu and Xue cogent and consistent, and not implausible in any aspect. Further, he was of the view that the workers had been truthful and candid in court. Their evidence on how they were initially managed by Li, and how the appellant came to assume Li’s role after the latter had passed away was wholly believable. He also found their version of events leading up to the payment of compensation by the appellant convincing.
31        In contrast, the district judge disbelieved the appellant’s testimony that he did not know that the foreign workers were not going to work for the sponsoring companies. The district judge found the appellant’s evidence to be “thoroughly rehearsed” and unbelievable. He was not persuaded by the appellant’s attempts to portray his role as a mere third party agent, whose responsibility was limited to performing an administrative role in the Form 8 EP Applications and collecting payments on behalf of Li’s widow, Francis and Teng.
32        Thus, having had the benefit of observing the demeanour of all the parties, the district judge accepted the workers’ testimonies that the appellant knew that they were seeking employment on their own at all material times. The district judge concluded (see 
[2004] SGDC 98
 at [172]):
Thus, I was satisfied that the accused had intended to aid the workers in obtaining their employment documents so that they could continue to seek employment on their own in return for the management and application fees paid to him by the workers.
33        Consequently, the district judge found that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant accordingly.
The appeal against conviction
35        The appellant appeared in person before me. Although he raised a whole slew of arguments in his written grounds of appeal, I was of the view that there was essentially one main issue for determination, namely, whether the district judge had erred in finding that the appellant had the requisite 
mens rea
 to abet the principal offence of making a false statement. This, in turn, hinged on the resolution of the following two issues:
(a)        whether the district judge had erred in accepting and relying upon the foreign workers’ evidence; and
(b)        whether the district judge had erred in giving little weight to the evidence of Teh Char Lay.
The law
36        In essence, this appeal involved an attack by the appellant on the findings of fact made by the district judge. As such, I found it appropriate to revisit the well-established principles of law relating to the approach of an appellate court in dealing with an appeal against a trial judge’s findings of fact. 
37        F A Chua J laid down the general principle in the seminal case of 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 that an appellate court will not overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or reached against the weight of the evidence. I endorsed this principle in an entire line of cases that followed: see for example
, Heng Aik Peng v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 469
;
 
Mahdi bin Ibrahim Bamadhaj v PP
[2003] 2 SLR 225
;
and 
Dong Guitian v PP
 
[2004] 3 SLR 34
. In particular, where findings of fact depend on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, an appellate court should be all the more reluctant to disturb a trial judge’s findings: see 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
. This is simply because the appellate court does not have the advantage, unlike the trial judge, of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour in court.
38        Given the above principles, the appellant was faced with the uphill task of convincing me that the trial judge’s findings ought to be overruled. 
Whether the trial judge had erred in accepting and relying upon the evidence of the foreign workers
Whether the workers’ evidence was contradictory and unreliable
39        The appellant submitted that the district judge had erred in accepting the evidence of the foreign workers, which he alleged was contradictory and unreliable. According to the appellant, the workers had made numerous false accusations against him in order to safeguard their own interests and to avoid criminal liability.
40        In support of his contention that the workers’ evidence was inherently unreliable, the appellant highlighted several alleged inconsistencies between the workers’ conditioned statements (admitted as evidence under s 371 of the CPC) and their oral testimonies in court. One such instance of supposed inconsistency was when Fang testified in court that the appellant had informed him that there was no job for him at Aquatic. The appellant submitted that Fang did not mention this crucial fact in his conditioned statement, and that this in itself proved that Fang had lied in court.
41        I was of the view that the appellant’s submission was misconceived. First of all, Fang’s oral testimony did not contradict his conditioned statement; it merely supplemented what he had stated previously, which he was fully entitled to do. There is no requirement that a conditioned statement has to be exhaustive, and a witness may give further evidence during trial. An omission to state a material fact in a previously made statement may in some cases arouse suspicion of fabrication of evidence by the witness on hindsight. Fang’s testimony in court, however, merely expounded on, and was entirely consistent with, his earlier statement. Second, once a conditioned statement is admitted in evidence under s 371 of the CPC, it is for the district judge to attach to it whatever weight he deems appropriate in the light of all the evidence present before the court. Thus, even if there are discrepancies between the two, the trial judge is fully entitled to accord more weight to either the oral testimony or the conditioned statement in arriving at his findings: see 
Rajendran s/o Kurusamy v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 225
.
42        I found more merit in the appellant’s next argument that Liu had materially contradicted his conditioned statement when he stated during cross‑examination that he did not have any contact with the appellant between the time the appellant gathered the workers to collect the fees owed to Li, and the time when the appellant contacted him to convert his work permit into an employment pass. This was inconsistent with his recorded evidence that he had called the appellant at least once during this period to request a letter of recommendation. I found this to be a material contradiction, given that the appellant’s conviction hinged almost entirely on the foreign workers’ evidence and there was no other documentary evidence demonstrating his guilt. The workers’ testimonies, that they had contacted the appellant during the relevant period to seek his assistance in looking for a job, constituted the strongest evidence against the appellant. It clearly established his 
mens rea
 in that he was aware that the workers were not employed by the sponsoring employers. Therefore, when Liu gave evidence in court that he had no contact with the appellant during the relevant period, this in my opinion undermined the Prosecution’s case. It was unfortunate that Liu was not given an opportunity to explain the inconsistency during trial. As the discrepancy was material, it was not satisfactory merely to attribute it to the fallibility of human memory. In my view, the district judge ought to have addressed this inconsistency expressly.
43        However, the above discrepancy in Liu’s evidence was insufficient to surmount the high threshold of showing that the district judge’s findings of fact were plainly wrong or reached against the weight of the evidence. Aside from this inadvertent omission to deal with this particular inconsistency, I found the district judge’s decision perfectly sound in all other aspects. All things considered, I did not think that the district judge was wrong to have accepted the workers’ evidence. In this regard, I found the following observation by the trial judge (see [32] 
supra
, at [168]) particularly persuasive:
[T]hese witnesses dealt with the accused separately when their respective work permit was about to expire. Yet, the collective evidence on their specific dealings with the accused was substantively consistent. In my view, such details and coherence could not have been concocted independently by these witnesses, and I was left with no doubt that it represented the truth.
Whether the district judge had erred in giving undue weight to the evidence of the foreign workers who were all accomplices 
44        The appellant further contended that the district judge had erred in giving undue weight to the evidence of the foreign workers, who were all accomplices. He submitted that it was patently unsafe to rely on the workers’ testimonies to establish his guilt, as they had not been prosecuted for the principal offence of making a false statement. 
45        I was of the opinion that this argument, albeit attractive, was untenable on the particular facts of this case. It was clear that the district judge was at all times mindful that he was dealing with accomplices’ evidence. Having specifically directed his mind to the issue, he was nevertheless satisfied that the workers were reliable witnesses who spoke the truth. In the district judge’s opinion, there was no reason for the workers to falsely implicate the appellant. They clearly regarded him as their employment agent, and there was nothing to indicate that they were unhappy with the services provided by him. In addition, the appellant had, from time to time, helped them with their job hunt and even compensated them when their employment passes were prematurely revoked.
46        Further, as the district judge noted, the workers were truthful even about matters that could implicate them. For instance, they did not attempt to hide the fact that they had sought employment on their own under Li’s management 
even before
 they had met the appellant, and that they continued to seek their own employment after they obtained their employment passes. By the time the workers made the above admission, MOM had already informed them that what they had done was against the law. Despite this, however, they did not try to conceal their long periods of illegal employment. 
47        Given the careful consideration that the district judge gave to the potential risks associated with the testimony of accomplices, I could find no valid reason to fault his decision. 
Whether the district judge had erred in giving little weight to the oral evidence of Teh Char Lay
48        Finally, the appellant sought to rely on Teh’s oral testimony to support his contention that Teng had intentionally deceived him into thinking that ETS needed workers for upcoming projects. According to the appellant, it was only because he honestly believed Teng’s assertions that he completed and submitted the workers’ application forms.
49        The district judge found Teh, who had unexpectedly denounced the evidence as contained in the SOF and his mitigation plea in favour of an account that was advantageous to the appellant, to be an unreliable witness who was “hesitant and guarded” when questioned by the Prosecution. This was in stark contrast to his demeanour during cross-examination where he was neither evasive nor vague in his replies. In fact, Teh even appeared eager to concur with the defence counsel that Teng was the sole originator of the whole scheme and that both the appellant and Teh were hapless victims of his scam. In the circumstances, the district judge decided to accord very little weight to his oral testimony.
50        On the evidence, I was satisfied that the district judge was correct to have placed little weight on Teh’s oral testimony. After thoroughly reviewing both the district judge’s grounds of decision and the notes of evidence, I concurred with the district judge that Teh’s explanations as to why his testimony in court was inconsistent with both his SOF and his mitigation plea, were both unpersuasive and implausible.
51        I was also of the view that, contrary to the appellant’s suggestion, the district judge had not placed undue weight on the SOF. In 
PP v Liew Kim Choo
 
[1997] 3 SLR 699
, I held that where a witness other than an accused person has pleaded guilty in earlier proceedings, the SOF of that witness may subsequently be used to prove the facts in the trial of his accomplice if the witness gives inconsistent evidence at that trial. The only caveat is that the SOF should be treated with circumspection, as it is essentially unproved. In this case, the district judge had taken a multitude of other factors into account before rejecting Teh’s oral testimony. The SOF was but one of the factors that affected the district judge’s decision. In the circumstances, I found the district judge’s reliance on the SOF perfectly reasonable.
The payment of compensation by the appellant to the foreign workers
52        In my view, the one piece of circumstantial evidence that ineluctably pointed to the appellant’s guilt was the fact that he had reimbursed the workers either $1,500 or $2,000 each for the premature termination of their employment passes.  These sums were grossly 
in excess
 of the commission he allegedly earned from Teng and Francis (
ie
 $500 to $800) for each successful employment pass application. The appellant claimed that he had no choice in the matter as the workers were continually harassing him. Fang, Chen and Liu had initially demanded compensation from Francis but when Francis subsequently absconded, the workers turned to him for payment. I gave no credence to this explanation and concurred with the district judge that the appellant’s reasons for compensating the workers were “absurd”. If the workers had indeed harassed him for compensation, the most logical course for the appellant to take would have been to report them to the authorities since, as he claimed, he was innocent and the workers were freelancing without his knowledge.
53        In light of the foregoing reasons, I concluded that there was absolutely no reason for me to disturb any of the district judge’s findings of fact. Accordingly, I dismissed the appellant’s appeal against conviction.
The appeal against sentence
54        The appellant’s appeal against sentence was a non-starter from the beginning as the appellant had not identified and put forward any relevant grounds of appeal in his submissions. Consequently, there was in reality little necessity for me to consider his appeal, bearing in mind the well-established principle of law that an appellate court will not interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial court unless it is satisfied that the sentence is manifestly excessive or wrong in law: see 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
[1986] SLR 126
.
55        In any case, I was satisfied that the district judge had properly applied his mind to the sentencing norm and principles that I enunciated in 
Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 301
, namely, that where a false representation is made under s 57(1) of the Act, a custodial sentence is the applicable norm. 
56        In 
Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP
, I also laid down four sentencing guidelines that the courts should keep in mind in applying the sentencing norm. They are:
(a)        the materiality of the false representation on the mind of the decision-maker;
(b)        the nature and the extent of the deception;
(c)        the consequences of the deception; and
(d)       
 
the offender’s personal mitigating factors.
57        I could not find any fault with the district judge’s application of the above sentencing guidelines in arriving at the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment per charge. First, the false representation made by the applicants with the appellant’s assistance was clearly material. MOM would not have issued the employment passes to the workers if they had known of the false information. Second, the deception perpetrated by the appellant was alarmingly blatant. Despite knowing that the workers were working in contravention of the conditions stipulated in their work permits, the appellant had no misgivings about asking them to continue seeking their own employment for his personal benefit. Third, as rightly noted by the district judge, the consequences of the deception had to be considered in the light of the fact that the appellant’s act could seriously undermine the “effective control by MOM of the occupation undertaken by foreign workers”. Finally, there was a glaring absence of any personal mitigating factors that were sufficiently exceptional to justify the imposition of only a fine on the appellant.
58        In view of the above, I considered that the sentence imposed was neither wrong in law nor manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against sentence.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In September 1985, the appellants/applicants, Wong Hong Toy and JB Jeyaretnam, underwent a fresh joint trial before the senior district judge in the subordinate courts as directed by the High Court after certain of the public prosecutor`s appeals were allowed (see the High Court`s judgment reported in 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 133
 ). At the new trial, they were charged separately for having made a false statement in a declaration which was by law receivable as evidence, an offence punishable under s 199 read with s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
Both of them were convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three months each. They then appealed to the High Court against the conviction and the sentence. The public prosecutor also appealed against the sentence, but that appeal was deemed withdrawn when no petition of appeal was filed within the time stipulated by law.
In March 1986, the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1986 came into operation. That Act increased the maximum fine that a district court could impose from $5,000 to $10,000. The relevance of this amendment will become apparent shortly.
In November 1986, the appeals came before Lai Kew Chai J. Wong Hong Toy and JB Jeyaretnam (`the appellants`) were represented by Lord Hugh Emlyn Hooson QC and Mr Subhas Anandan, while the public prosecutor was represented by Mr Tan Teow Yeow and Mr Loke Yoon Kee. After hearing arguments on 3 and 4 November 1985, the learned judge reserved his judgment. On 10 November 1986, Lai Kew Chai J delivered judgment in open court. He dismissed the appeals against conviction and varied the sentence of each appellant to that of one month`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000, in default of payment of which a further term of one month`s imprisonment was imposed.
Immediately after judgment was delivered, the appellants made an application by way of Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986 in which Lai Kew Chai J was asked to exercise his discretion to reserve seven questions, which the appellants submitted were questions of law of public interest, for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed). The seven questions were set out in an affidavit filed by the appellants` solicitors. The learned judge directed that the application be heard before him the following day, that is, 11 November 1986. Bail was also granted to the appellants.
On the same day that judgment was delivered (10 November 1986), the appellants` solicitors filed a second affidavit setting out another question which they would be asking Lai Kew Chai J to reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The question was: 
 
Whether it is competent for the High Court sitting in an appellate jurisdiction in a criminal appeal from a subordinate court to pass a sentence which the subordinate court was not competent to pass at the time sentence was pronounced.
 
 
 
This affidavit was, according to the appellants` solicitors, filed at 4pm on 10 November 1986. It must have been this affidavit which drew the attention of the learned judge to the fact that the trial in the subordinate courts had been concluded, and sentence passed, prior to the coming into operation of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1986. The district court, in September 1985, could impose a maximum fine of $5,000 only.
At about 4.45pm that day, the R
egistrar of the Supreme Court requested counsel for the appellants, Mr Subhas Anandan (Lord Hooson QC had already left Singapore at the conclusion of arguments on 4 November 1986), and the two deputy public prosecutors, Mr Tan and Mr Loke, to appear in the chambers of Lai Kew Chai J. They dutifully complied. The appellants were not present. In his chambers, Lai Kew Chai J informed Mr Subhas Anandan, Mr Tan and Mr Loke that he was altering the fines imposed on the appellants from $10,000 to $5,000, and that he was doing so pursuant to s 216 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The one month imprisonment in the event of default remained. These orders are contained in a `further judgment` also dated 10 November 1986.
On 11 November 1986, Lai Kew Chai J proceeded to hear Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986. By then, a third affidavit had been filed by the appellants` solicitors, setting out two more questions which they wished to have reserved for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. At the conclusion of arguments, the learned judge dismissed the motion in a reasoned judgment delivered on the same day.
 The matters before the Court of Criminal Appeal
There are three matters before us - one criminal appeal and two criminal motions. In Criminal Appeal No 17/86, the appellants are appealing against Lai Kew Chai J`s dismissal of Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986. The petition of appeal states that the appellants are dissatisfied with the order of Lai Kew Chai J on the following grounds:
 
 
(1) The learned judge erred in law in holding that none of the questions which your petitioners wished to reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal were questions of law of public interest. 
 
(2) The learned judge erred in law in holding that the determination of those questions or any one of them was not a matter of public interest contemplated under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act.
  
 
 
The appellants pray that the order of Lai Kew Chai J may be set aside and the questions, or such of them as this court approves, be reserved for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
In Criminal Motion No 61 of 1986, the appellants are asking: 
 
... for an order that it is proper and would be in the interest of justice that a reference should be entertained by this honourable court in accordance with the provisions of s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) in respect of the questions of law of public interest (arising in Magistrate`s Appeals Nos 374 and 375 of 1985) as set out in the annexure hereto.
 
 
 
Or, alternatively, that this court doth remit these proceedings to the honourable judge who heard the said magistrate`s appeals with a direction that he doth refer to the Court of Criminal Appeal for its determination under s 60 of the said Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) the questions of law as aforesaid.
Or, in the further alternative, that the appellants/applicants be given leave to appeal against the order of dismissal by the said appeal judge made on 11 November 1986 refusing the application for leave to reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal the said questions of law.
Or, in the further alternative, that the appellants/applicants be given leave to appeal against the order by the said judge on the grounds that the said judge, in refusing to certify the points of law of public interest, did not exercise his discretion judicially (in that they were unfairly discriminated contrary to art 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore).
Finally, in Criminal Motion No 65 of 1986, filed one month after the first two matters had been filed, the appellants are asking this court for an order:
 
 
(i) that the sentence of fine of $10,000 passed by the High Court on 10 November 1986 on each of the applicants is ultra vires, null and void; 
 
(ii) that the subsequent alteration to the said sentence made on the same day is invalid, inoperative and of no effect; and 
 
(iii) that the sentence of fine be quashed and any moneys paid under the sentence be returned to the applicants.
  
 
 
 
 Jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal
 
The fundamental question before us is whether this court has the jurisdiction to hear this appeal and these two criminal motions. The provisions of law that bear on this issue are to be found in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) (hereinafter referred to as `the SCJA`), and they are the following sections: 
 
Section 7
 
 
 
The Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall consist of:
(a) the High Court, which shall exercise original and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction; 
(b) the Court of Appeal, ... 
(c) the Court of Criminal Appeal, which shall exercise appellate criminal jurisdiction. 
Section 44 
(1) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any appeal against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. 
... 
(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with the provisions of section 59 or 60 of this Act.
 
 
 
Section 59 deals with reservation of questions of law for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal when such questions arise in the course of a 
 trial 
 before the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction. This section is therefore of no relevance here.
Section 60 SCJA is central to the arguments before us. It is therefore useful to set it out in full:
 
 
(1) When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court the Judge may on the application of any party and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal. 
 
(2) An application under this section shall be made within one month or such longer time as the Court of Criminal Appeal may permit of the determination of the appeal to which it relates and in the case of an application by the Public Prosecutor shall be made by or with the consent in writing of that officer only. 
 
(3) When a question has been reserved under this section the Judge who has reserved the same may make such orders as he may see fit for the arrest, custody or release on bail of any party to the appeal. 
 
(4) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall hear and determine the question reserved and may make such orders as the High Court might have made as it may consider just for the disposal of the appeal. 
 
(5) For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions - 
 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; and 
 
(b) the reservation of a question of law for the consideration of the High Court under the provisions of any written law relating to criminal procedure or the exercise by the High Court of any power of revision under any such written law shall be deemed to be an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter.
  
 
 
We will now deal with each of the three matters before us.
 (1) Criminal Appeal No 17 of 1986
The issue here is whether Lai Kew Chai J, in refusing to reserve the questions, was acting in his appellate or original criminal jurisdiction.
(a) Appellants` arguments
Mr Donald Martin Thomas QC for the appellants submitted that Lai Kew Chai J`s determination of Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986 was in exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court. Accordingly, we have the jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the dismissal of that motion pursuant to s 44(1) SCJA. He argued that Lai Kew Chai J was functus officio after delivering judgment in the appeals from the district court. An application under s 60 SCJA could be made only after determination of the appeal and was a fresh or original process. It was therefore not part of the appeals. It was also submitted that s 60 SCJA conferred original, and not appellate, jurisdiction as Lai Kew Chai J was not considering anything that the district court had considered. Reliance was also placed on the Malaysian case of 
 Yap Ee Kong v PP 
.
In 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
, the same appellants had similarly sought to appeal against the High Court`s dismissal of an application to reserve certain questions for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. There, the Court of Criminal Appeal held, in dismissing the appeal, that a decision not to reserve any question of law was part and parcel of the exercise of the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court and, accordingly, it had no jurisdiction to hear such an appeal. It also held that the Court of Criminal Appeal was a creature of statute and its jurisdictions were those conferred upon it by the SCJA.
Mr Thomas, on the authority of 
 Mah Kah Yew v PP 
, rightly pointed out that the Court of Criminal Appeal was not irretrievably bound by its previous decisions. He sought to persuade us that the decision in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 was given `per incuriam` and was not binding on us.
The appellants in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 did not stop there. They went on to present a petition praying for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Judicial Committee, after hearing counsel in support thereof and in opposition thereto, refused leave and dismissed the petition. Mr Thomas submitted that such dismissal was not necessarily an endorsement of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The arguments before the Judicial Committee, he said, proceeded on the basis of a concession made by Mr Blom-Cooper QC, for the appellants, that the High Court, in hearing an application under s 60 SCJA, was acting in its appellate jurisdiction.
It was also contended before us that this court has inherent jurisdiction to hear such an appeal.
(b) Public prosecutor`s arguments
Mr Tan Teow Yeow submitted that arguments on the question of jurisdiction had been advanced before the Judicial Committee, but he would not seek to contend that the committee`s refusal of special leave to appeal implied approval of the Court of Criminal Appeal`s decision. This was because the House of Lords, in 
 Wilson v Colchester Justices 
, held that the grant or refusal by an Appeal Committee of the House of Lords of leave to appeal to the House was in no way to be taken as implying disapproval or approval of the judgments of the court below. That presumably applied to the Judicial Committee as well. He further argued that it was for the appellants to persuade us that the previous Court of Criminal Appeal`s decision was wrong or given per incuriam and this they had not done.
Mr Tan urged us not to uphold any wider claim to jurisdiction than what was already provided in the statutes. He referred us to s 240 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) which reads: 
 
No appeal shall lie from a judgment, sentence or order of a criminal court except as provided for by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
Section 6 of the CPC identifies the High Court as one of the criminal courts.
(c) Our decision
We should begin by reiterating what has been said in 
 Mah Kah Yew v PP 
 by the High Court (which, in that case, consisted of three judges): 
 
The doctrine of stare decisis is a necessary and well established doctrine in our system of jurisprudence and of our judicial system which we have inherited from England ...
 
 
 
We would also express our approval of that case as having stated the correct principles pertaining to the doctrine of stare decisis. The court there said: 
 
It is our opinion, also, and for the same reasons as expressed in 
 R v Taylor
, supra, that the present Court of Criminal Appeal would not consider itself irretrievably bound by its own decisions or by those of a court of coordinate jurisdiction.
 
 
 
In 
 R v Taylor 
, the court had this to say: 
 
If it finds, on reconsideration, that, in the opinion of a full court assembled for that purpose, the law has been either misapplied or misunderstood in a decision which it has previously given, and that, on the strength of that decision, an accused person has been sentenced and imprisoned, it is the bounden duty of the court to reconsider the earlier decision with a view to seeing whether that person had been properly convicted. The exceptions which apply in civil cases ought not to be the only ones applied in such a case as the present ...
 
 
 
`The exceptions which apply in civil cases` are those alluded to in the case of 
 Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd 
. There, the English Court of Appeal held that it was bound to follow previous decisions of its own until such decisions were reversed by the House of Lords. The court added that there were, however, three exceptions to this, namely:
 
 
(i) the Court of Appeal is entitled and bound to decide which of two conflicting decisions of its own it will follow; 
 
(ii) the Court of Appeal is bound to refuse to follow a decision of its own which, though not expressly overruled, cannot, in its opinion, stand with a decision of the House of Lords; 
 
(iii) the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow a decision of its own if it is satisfied that the decision was given `per incuriam`.
  
 
 
Applying the principles which we have set out above, we can find no reason in law justifying a refusal to follow the decision of the court in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
. The Malaysian case of 
 Yap Ee Kong v PP 
 relied upon by Mr Thomas here was also cited and referred to by the court in the previous proceedings. The Malaysian case is of no assistance to the appellants as it relied on certain provisions of the Malaysian Constitution of which we have no equivalent.
In our opinion, s 60 SCJA does not confer original jurisdiction on the High Court judge. It must be noted that an application under that section can be made only after an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, and the application is to `
 the 
 judge` who heard the appeal, and not to any other judge. The application must relate to questions of law of public interest which have arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal. The wording in s 60(1) SCJA reinforces the view that a decision on an application thereunder is part and parcel of the exercise of the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court judge.
Section 60(3) SCJA sets out the powers of the judge in respect of the arrest, custody or release on bail of any party to the appeal, when he has decided to reserve a question under s 60(1). This again shows that the application is so intertwined with the appeal that it cannot be logical to say that while the determination of the appeal is in exercise of its 
 appellate 
 criminal jurisdiction, the determination of the application is in exercise of the High Court`s 
 original 
 criminal jurisdiction.
Finally, s 60(4) makes it clear that the Court of Criminal Appeal, when hearing a question reserved, is in fact hearing the appeal from the subordinate court`s decision, albeit confined to the question reserved, as it may then make `
 such orders as the High Court might have made as it may consider just for the disposal of the appeal 
`. In our opinion, there can be no room for argument that the determination of an application under s 60(1) is not in exercise of the 
 appellate 
 criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.
In our opinion, the decision of the court in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 is plainly correct. While the refusal by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of special leave to appeal may not necessarily imply an endorsement of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal (applying 
 Wilson v Colchester Justices 
), we are at least fortified in that Lord Bridge, a member of the Judicial Committee, was of the view that there was no question but that the High Court judge in those proceedings had been sitting in an appellate capacity. This was disclosed to us at the hearing of this appeal by counsel for the appellants.
Since Lai Kew Chai J was undoubtedly exercising 
 appellate 
 criminal jurisdiction in refusing to reserve the questions put forward by the appellants and thereby dismissing Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986, no right of appeal lies to this court against his refusal, under the clear provisions of s 44(1) of the SCJA. We would also respectfully agree with the earlier decision of this court that the Court of Criminal Appeal is a creature of the SCJA and has only such jurisdiction as is provided by the Act.
Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No 17 of 1986 is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
 (2) Criminal Motion No 61 of 1986 and Criminal Motion No 65 of 1986
These two matters can be conveniently dealt with together as Mr Thomas has indicated that his arguments for Criminal Motion No 65 of 1986 would cover Criminal Motion No 61 of 1986. Again, the question of paramount importance here is that of our jurisdiction to entertain these applications.
(a) Appellants` arguments
It was contended that this court could hear objections to an order defective in law even if there was no right of appeal on the merits of the sentence. In support of this proposition, Mr Thomas relied on 
 R v Cain 
, a decision of the House of Lords. We will revert to this case later.
(b) Public prosecutor`s arguments
Mr Tan`s argument on this point was simply that there was no provision for this court to entertain such applications. He submitted that 
 R v Cain 
was distinguishable.
(c) Our decision
We will assume, for the purpose of deciding this preliminary point, that the original sentence and subsequent alteration by Lai Kew Chai J are wrong in law.
In 
 R v Cain 
, the Crown Court made a criminal bankruptcy order against the appellant. His appeal to the Court of Appeal (criminal division) against this order was dismissed. No question was then raised as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal. Two issues were raised in the House of Lords. We are here concerned only with the first issue, which was whether an appeal against the making of a criminal bankruptcy order lay at all.
Section 40(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 provided: 
 
No appeal shall lie against the making of a criminal bankruptcy order.
 
 
 
By s 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, a person convicted on indictment (ie after trial in the Crown Court) may appeal to the Court of Appeal against sentence. The Criminal Appeal Act 1968 imposed no conditions on this right except that it may be exercised only with the leave of the Court of Appeal. No appeal lay against a sentence fixed by law. By s 50(1), a criminal bankruptcy order was a sentence for the purposes of the Act.
The House of Lords held that s 40(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 was subject to an implied limitation to the effect that no appeal lay save where the issue was that the court, in making the order, had exceeded the power conferred on it by Parliament. Since the question in that case was whether a criminal bankruptcy order could have been made in the circumstances of the case, there was therefore jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against sentence.
Lord Scarman, with whom the rest of their Lordships agreed, after referring to those cases where the Court of Appeal entertained appeals against unappealable orders on the ground of `jurisdiction`, had this to say (at p 55): 
 
... As I understand the ratio of the cases in which an appeal against an `unappealable` order has been allowed, it is that the statutory prohibition of appeal must be construed by reference to the provisions in the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 dealing with appeal against sentence.
 
 
 
My Lords, I think this is the correct approach. A criminal bankruptcy order is a sentence for the purposes of the Act: s 50(1). By s 9, a person convicted on indictment (ie after trial in the Crown Court) may appeal to the Court of Appeal against sentence. The Act imposes no conditions on this right save that it may be exercised only with the leave of the Court of Appeal (s 11(1)); and, of course, no appeal lies against a sentence fixed by law.
I think that the courts have been right to maintain in full the right of appeal against sentence and to construe statutory prohibitions of appeal as not applicable to sentences not authorized by law. The right of appeal against sentence is of fundamental importance to the subject: it is his protection against sentences not authorized by law as well as against the sentence which is too severe or is inappropriate. It is a reasonable inference not to be gainsaid save by specific statutory provision that where Parliament prohibits an appeal against sentence, it is dealing with the discretionary power of the court to make the order and not addressing its prohibition to orders defective in law. In the absence of express indication to the contrary, it would be unthinkable that Parliament could intend to deprive the subject of his right to appeal against a sentence which the court had no power to pass.
Lord Scarman was, therefore, speaking in the context of a statutory right of appeal against sentence, and of another statutory provision curtailing that right in respect of a criminal bankruptcy order. That decision, therefore, does not support the general proposition put forward by the appellants.
In Singapore, there is no general right of appeal in criminal cases except such as is provided by law. This is made clear by s 240 of the CPC, the text of which we have quoted earlier.
What we have to do in this case is interpret the provisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which spell out the jurisdiction of this court. We cannot therefore go outside the scope of our jurisdiction spelt out so clearly in s 44 of the SCJA. As we have decided earlier, Lai Kew Chai J was undoubtedly exercising 
 appellate 
 criminal jurisdiction throughout the proceedings before him. To hear any of the prayers set out in Criminal Motion No 61 of 1986 would be tantamount to hearing an appeal against Lai Kew Chai J`s dismissal of Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986. Equally, to hear the application in Criminal Motion No 65 of 1986 would be tantamount to hearing an appeal against Lai Kew Chai J`s decision on the sentence passed on the appellants. There is no provision in law at all conferring such a right of appeal in either case, unlike the position in 
 R v Cain 
 and other cases referred to by Lord Scarman.
What seems to us to be even more untenable is that the appellants sought, by multiple prayers in Criminal Motion No 61 of 1986, to invoke the powers of judicial review by the Court of Criminal Appeal over the High Court. On this point, we need only refer to two passages in the speeches of two of their Lordships in 
 Re Racal Communications Ltd 
.
Lord Diplock, at p 384, said: 
 
The High Court is not a court of limited jurisdiction and its constitutional role includes the interpretation of written laws ... There is simply no room for error going to his jurisdiction, nor, as is conceded by counsel for the respondent, is there any room for judicial review. Judicial review is available as a remedy for mistakes of law made by 
 inferior courts
 and tribunals only. Mistakes of law made by judges of the High Court acting in their capacity as such can be corrected only by means of appeal to an appellate court; and if, as in the instant case, the statute provides that the judge`s decision shall not be appealable, they cannot be corrected at all.
 
 
 
Lord Salmon, at p 386, said: 
 
The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is defined by statute. It has no jurisdiction to make a judicial review of a decision of the High Court.
 
 
 
These passages, although made in the context of an original civil jurisdiction of the High Court, are equally appropriate in our context.
We would also add that this court cannot take upon itself to hear questions which have not been reserved for its decision by the High Court. In our opinion, s 44(5) SCJA makes this patently clear as it provides that this court shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters 
 brought before it in accordance with the provisions of s 59 or 60 SCJA 
. The only way that the matters can be brought before us in accordance with the statutory provisions is for the High Court to reserve questions of law. In so far as the appellants here are concerned, when Lai Kew Chai J refused to do so in his discretion, that is the end of the matter. Accordingly, our decision is that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain either of these criminal motions.
Mr Thomas also submitted that all the courses suggested in all three matters before us could come under s 54(1) SCJA. The short answer is that s 54(1) deals with the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal `at the hearing of an 
 appeal 
`. That begs the question as to whether we have the jurisdiction to hear these three matters in the first place.
Our decision on the issue of jurisdiction is sufficient to dispose of all three matters before us. However, we think it useful to deal with a legal point raised in these proceedings.
The point is that of the alteration of the fine by the High Court judge.
It was common ground that Lai Kew Chai J could have imposed a maximum fine of $5,000 only, as the trial was concluded before the amendments to the CPC came into effect. The appellants contended that the original fine of $10,000 imposed by Lai Kew Chai J was a nullity, and that his alteration to the fine made on the same day was also invalid and of no effect. At the centre of the arguments was the true import of s 216 of the CPC, which Lai Kew Chai J invoked in altering the amount of the fine so that it accorded with his intention to impose whatever was the maximum fine.
Section 216 CPC appeared in the CPC in 1900 as s 266. It has remained in substantially the same form since then. It is as follows:
 
 
(1) No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its judgment, shall alter or review the same. 
 
(2) A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other mistake may be rectified at any time before the court rises the day.
  
 
 
A plain reading of the section shows that the High Court can alter or review its judgment. There is no reason to compel a restrictive interpretation, especially since we are concerned with a superior court of record, which is also the highest court of trial in criminal cases. We must give effect to the plain meaning of the words in the section. To ignore the words `other than the High Court` would be to render them otiose. In our opinion, s 216 CPC gives sanction to Lai Kew Chai J to alter the fine. It was necessary for him to do so to correct a mistake as to the maximum fine that could be imposed.
In the light of what we think is the true scope of s 216, cases that held a court to be functus officio immediately after sentencing can have no application in this present case.
The prosecution put before us several English authorities dealing with the power of the Crown Court to vary or rescind its sentence or order within 28 days (
 Manjeet Singh Sodhi 
; 
 Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Menocal 
; 
 R v William Joseph Thomas Reilly 
). The judges of assize, the predecessor of the Crown Court, possessed a power at common law to vary or rescind their orders within the period of the then current assize. Such a power has been embodied in statutory form in s 11(2) Courts Act 1971 and later s 47(2) Supreme Court Act 1981. The Crown Court is, like the Singapore High Court, a superior court of record and the highest court of trial in criminal matters. We would only say that these English cases show that it is not such a radical proposition to read s 216 CPC as having preserved the right of, or conferred power on, the High Court to alter or review its judgment.
The only point that remains is the propriety of the alteration having been made in chambers and in the absence of the appellants. In 
 Lawrence v R 
, the Privy Council held that a judge had no jurisdiction after the discharge of the jury and in the absence of the accused to alter the sentence recorded at the trial, even if the term of imprisonment was not effectively altered. In 
 R v John Cleere 
, it was held that a defendant was entitled to be present at every stage of his trial, including the stage of sentencing. Where the Crown Court, in the exercise of its power under s 47(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, proposed to alter a sentence which had already been passed, the offender or his counsel must be given the opportunity to address the court. Otherwise the variation would be null and void.
In 
 Lawrence 
`s case,12 it was a trial at special assizes. The common law power of variation could only be exercised before the end of the assizes. However, the variation took place after the jury had been discharged and the assizes closed (see p 702 of the report). The variation was therefore wrong. Further, neither the accused nor his counsel was present. The fact that the variation had been done in chambers did not appear to be a ground of criticism by the Privy Council.
Similarly, in 
 John Cleere 
`s case,13 the sentence was altered without the presence of the accused or his counsel. In addition, the alteration was to the detriment of the accused as the suspended sentence was changed to one of immediate imprisonment.
In the case that we have before us, counsel for the appellants was present together with the deputy public prosecutors, although the appellants were not present, at the amendment. The mere fact that the amendment was done in chambers is not objectionable per se. The important consideration is whether the appellants or their counsel were present. Moreover, the alteration in the sentence resulted in a $10,000 fine being reduced to one of $5,000. There was clearly no detriment or prejudice to either of the two appellants. Accordingly, the appeal and the two criminal motions before us are dismissed.

: The two appeals (MA 180/2000 and MA 201/2000) were brought by the accused who was appealing against his sentence only. The first appeal MA 180/2000 was against the decision of District Judge Seng Kwang Boon, who, on 12 July 2000, had sentenced the appellant to reformative training. The second appeal MA 201/2000 was against the decision of District Judge Mavis Chionh on 26 July 2000 to impose a second sentence of reformative training which was to run concurrently with the one ordered earlier.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
On 3 February 1998, at the age of 14 years and 8 months, the appellant was found guilty and convicted by the Juvenile Court on two counts of theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and a further two counts of theft under s 379A of the Penal Code. Consequently, the appellant was sentenced by the Juvenile Court to stay in the Singapore Boys` Home (`the Boys` Home`) for 30 months. On 30 June 1998, I heard and dismissed his appeal against conviction and sentence and ordered him to commence serving his 30-month term in the Boys` Home from that day onwards.
During his stay at the Boys` Home, the appellant was ill-disciplined and a recalcitrant trouble-maker who failed to comply with the rules and regulations of the Home. The following acts of misconduct and its surrounding circumstances were recorded by Mr Koh Ann Keong, the Superintendent of the Boys` Home: 
(i) On 20 March 2000, the appellant and two other residents of the Boys` Home vandalised the Segregation Room by forcing open the security grille of the toilet exhaust louve, removing a piece of metal rod and using it to make a hole the size of a computer mouse on the ventilation wall. They then used the metal rod to reach for the light switch outside the Segregation Room to switch off the light. 
(ii) On 22 March 2000, the appellant attempted suicide by drinking shampoo in the dormitory. He was later examined by the psychiatrist of the Institute of Mental Health, who assessed him as non-suicidal and no follow-up treatment was required. The appellant claimed that he attempted suicide because he was unhappy with the punishment of four strokes of the cane that was meted out to him by the Superintendent. He had been punished for being rude, defiant and refusing to carry out the teacher`s instructions to clean the classroom properly. 
(iii) On 14 April 2000, the appellant escaped from the lawful custody of one Mohan s/o Francis Xavier, the Senior House Master of Block E of the Boys` Home. The appellant had been brought to the Jurong Polyclinic for medical attention after he complained of asthmatic problems. The appellant absconded after receiving medical attention and whilst waiting for his prescription. 
(iv) At the time of his escape, the appellant`s hands were cuffed with a pair of Smith and Wesson handcuffs. After escaping, he managed to remove the handcuffs which he threw away after that. 
(v) On 27 May 2000, the appellant was arrested by the police and taken back to the Boys` Home. On the same night, the appellant vandalised the Segregation Room again. This time he removed a metal showerhead and tied it to one end of his T-shirt, making a potentially dangerous weapon which could cause serious injuries if swung at another person`s head. The appellant then demanded to be released from the Segregation Room and to see a psychiatrist as well as the Superintendent immediately. When his demands were not acceded to, the appellant banged his head against the wall to protest. Eventually, he had to be restrained to a bed in order to protect him from further self-harm. Thereafter, he abused the staff with vulgarities.
 The proceedings 
 
 
 
On 29 May 2000, following these acts of misconduct by the appellant, the Superintendent of the Boys` Home made representations to the Juvenile Court under s 44(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act (`CYPA`) (Cap 38). The information provided by the Superintendent referred to the appellant`s misbehaviour, as enumerated earlier, and stated that the appellant was of so unruly a character that he could not be detained in the Boys` Home.
On 20 June 2000, after considering the information from the Superintendent, the Juvenile Court was satisfied that the appellant was of so unruly a character that he could not be detained in the Boys` Home. As the appellant was already 17 years old at the time of the hearing, the court called for a Reformative Training Report to assess his suitability for a sentence of reformative training. After receiving a report stating that the appellant was suitable for reformative training, the Juvenile Court invoked its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA to refer the appellant to a District Court so that he may be dealt with under s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). For the ease of reference, s 44(2)(e) CYPA states as follows: 
 
 
(2) Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied, on the representations of the manager of a place of detention, an approved school or an approved home, that a person ordered to be detained in the place of detention, approved school or approved home is of 
 so unruly a character that he cannot be so detained 
, the Court may - 
 
... 
 
(e) where the person is a male and has attained the age of 16 years and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may order him to be brought before a District Court to be dealt with under section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Cap. 68.
  
 
 
The matter came before District Judge Seng Kwang Boon on 12 July 2000, who, after reading the information provided by the Superintendent of the Boys` Home and the pre-sentence report, agreed with the Juvenile Court that reformative training was appropriate for the appellant. The appellant was thus sentenced to undergo a period of reformative training. This formed the background leading to MA 180/2000.
At the same time, two fresh charges (DAC 23944/2000 and MAC 3929/2000) were brought against the appellant in relation to his escape from the Boys` Home. The first charge was for escaping from the lawful custody of Mohan s/o Francis Xavier when they were at the Jurong Polyclinic, an offence under s 224 of the Penal Code. The second charge related to the appellant`s disposal of his handcuffs after making his escape. The police were not able to recover these handcuffs even after the arrest of the appellant. The act of throwing away the handcuffs, which cost around $48-$60, constituted an offence under s 427, Penal Code.
The proceedings for the two fresh charges were first heard by District Judge Mavis Chionh on 20 June 2000. It should be noted that this hearing took place prior to that before District Judge Seng Kwang Boon, as mentioned earlier. The appellant pleaded guilty to the two charges and in mitigation, said that he was `very sorry` and asked for leniency from the court. After taking into account his previous convictions and his disciplinary record in the Boys` Home, DJ Mavis Chionh was of the view that reformative training should be considered. A pre-sentence report was therefore called for. The first report that was presented by the Prisons Department certified that the appellant was physically and mentally fit and suitable for reformative training. The appellant`s counsel, however, informed the court that the report failed to make any reference to the appellant`s admittance into the Institute of Mental Health after he drank shampoo. DJ Mavis Chionh thus directed that a supplemental report be prepared in order to take into account the concern raised over the appellant`s mental health history. A further report was thereafter prepared and considered by DJ Mavis Chionh on 26 July 2000. The supplemental report confirmed that the appellant was suitable for reformative training. Accordingly, a sentence of reformative training was ordered by DJ Mavis Chionh. As DJ Seng Kwang Boon had, about two weeks earlier on 12 July 2000, also imposed the same sentence on the appellant, the second sentence of reformative training was ordered to commence running from the same date as the term imposed earlier. This was in consideration of the principle laid down in 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
 , where it was held that `consecutive terms of reformative training are wrong in principle and could give rise to problems in practice`. The appeal against DJ Mavis Chionh`s decision formed the subject-matter of MA 201/2000.
 The appeals 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MA 180/2000 (against the decision of DJ Seng Kwang Boon)
 
The sentence of reformative training was imposed here as a result of the Juvenile Court invoking its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA. Under this provision, it must be established that the appellant was `of so unruly a character` that he cannot continue to be detained in the Boys` Home and it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre.
On the question of what would constitute `of so unruly a character` in the context of the CYPA, there did not seem to be any relevant case authority that had previously interpreted such a phrase or the word `unruly`. In such circumstances, the appropriate approach was to adopt the plain and literal meaning of the term and phrase. For that purpose, I found it useful to refer to some of the definitions of the word `unruly` as stated in various dictionaries. In 
 West`s Legal Thesaurus/Dictionary 
, the word `unruly` was defined as `difficult to manage or control; hyperactive`. In 
 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 
, the same word was defined to mean `not easily controlled or disciplined; ungovernable; disorderly` and in the 
 Longman Dictionary of the English Language 
, the meaning stated was `difficult to discipline or manage` and `not submissive to control`.
Whether or not the appellant was `of so unruly a character` was clearly a question of fact which must be determined from the factual circumstances of the case. I noted from his record that, since his early secondary school days, the appellant had shown himself to be disobedient, disruptive and obdurate. He was expelled from Thomson Secondary School in November 1996 after spending a year there. The basis for his expulsion was his continual misconduct which included possession of cigarettes, theft, molestation, rude behaviour towards teachers, assault and causing hurt to classmates. While the appellant was still at Thomson Secondary School, the principal had referred him to the Child Guidance Clinic managed by the Ministry of Health. He was diagnosed as having a `conduct disorder`. The appellant was then given another chance at schooling and was placed in First Toa Payoh Secondary School. However, he failed to learn from his errant ways and created a series of problems in the short period of three months that he spent there. It was observed by his teachers that the appellant was disruptive and rude in class, he vandalised school property, refused to do his work and was found in possession of cigarettes. He was a persistent trouble-maker to the extent that the school was left with no choice but to expel him in March 1997. Subsequently, the appellant voluntarily admitted himself into the Singapore Boys` Town in July 1997. Once again, he failed to make use of the opportunity to improve himself. Soon after his admission, he ran away from the institution to avoid punishment for his misbehaviour and even after his return some time later, he got into fights and other forms of trouble again. After he was caught and convicted for a series of thefts, the appellant was sentenced to stay in the Singapore Boys` Home for 30 months. Probation was not recommended for him as it was observed that the appellant was not at all remorseful for his misdeeds and required a stricter and more regimented environment to instil in him greater self-discipline and respect for the law and authority.
It was evident from the facts that the rehabilitative experience which the Boys` Home was intended to provide had not been achieved. The report prepared by the Superintendent of the Boys` Home for the Juvenile Court, listed out the whole litany of misdemeanours committed by the appellant even after he had been admitted to the Boys` Home. He remained defiant towards authority and refused to take any responsibility for his various wrong-doings. I did not have any doubt that the appellant was clearly of an `unruly` character. He had demonstrated himself, time and again, to be a rebellious and deviant youth, almost incapable of control. The stay in the Boys` Home was plainly not able to provide the suitable environment for his rehabilitation and reformation. In such a situation, and in view of the fact that the appellant had attained the age of 16 years, I was of the view that the Juvenile Court was entitled to exercise its powers under s 44(2)(e) of the CYPA, to order the appellant to be brought before a District Court to be given a sentence of reformative training.
Taking into consideration the young age of the appellant and his unfortunate family background, I decided that it was appropriate to give him another chance at rehabilitation. Since young, the appellant had lacked proper parental guidance and supervision, his parents having separated since he was three years old, and this was probably the fundamental cause of his unruliness. The appellant was in serious need of some strict guidance and enforced reformation. This would not be suitably provided in a custodial sentence. In the case of 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
  at 142, I had stated that: 
 
Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better. The corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young don`t know any better` and they may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led and less controlled in their behaviour.
 
 
 
These considerations were similarly applicable to the present facts of the case. A custodial sentence was therefore unsuitable for the appellant.
However, it was obviously not a satisfactory arrangement for the appellant to continue his sentence at the Boys` Home, it being apparent that a more severe and regimented environment was necessary to steer the appellant in the right path. Thus, I was of the view that a sentence of reformative training was the most apposite in such circumstances and was not excessive at all. The appeal against the decision of DJ Seng Kwang Boon was therefore dismissed.
 MA 201/2000 (against the decision of DJ Mavis Chionh)
For the earlier stated reasons, the sentence passed by DJ Mavis Chionh was similarly not excessive. The two fresh offences under s 224 and s 427 of the Penal Code each provided for punishment `with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both`. Applying the principles I laid down in 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
 (supra), a custodial sentence was not suitable on the present facts since the appellant had already been sentenced to reformative training by DJ Seng Kwang Boon. The appellant`s antecedents and long history of misconduct, however, ruled out the mere imposition of a fine for the two offences. In the light of all the foregoing, I found the concurrent sentence of reformative training ordered by DJ Mavis Chionh to be the most appropriate sentence for the appellant. Accordingly, I ordered for this appeal to be dismissed too.

(delivering the judgment of the court): These two appeals arose from the decision of the High Court in CM 6 and 7/99 which were heard together. Criminal Motion 6 was taken out by Microsoft Corporation (`Microsoft`), Adobe Systems Inc (`Adobe`), Autodesk Inc (`Autodesk`) and Ronald Eckstrom (`Eckstrom`), and CM 7/99 by Business Software Alliance (`BSA`), Stuart Ong, and Lee Cross. The two criminal motions were identical in all material respects and sought the same orders. Both motions were heard before the learned Chief Justice and were dismissed, and against his decision these two appeals were filed respectively. Criminal Appeal 25/99 was filed by Microsoft, Adobe, Autodesk and Eckstrom and is against the dismissal of CM 6/99, and Crim App 26/99 was filed by BSA, Stuart Ong and Lee Cross and is against the dismissal of CM 7/99. The respondents in these two appeals are SM Summit Holdings (`Summit Holdings`) and Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd (`Summit CD`).
 Background 
 
 
 
Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk are companies incorporated in the United States of America and are engaged in the business of, inter alia, publishing and distributing computer software. BSA is a software anti-piracy watchdog organization of which Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk are members. Stuart Ong is the legal counsel of Autodesk in the Asia Pacific region and vice-president of BSA. Lee Cross is a vice-president and managing director of the Asia Pacific region and regional counsel of BSA. Eckstrom is a corporate attorney of Microsoft and vice president of BSA. We shall refer to these parties collectively as the appellants.
Summit Holdings is a public company and was, at the material time, listed on the SESDAQ Board of the then Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd. It is currently listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange. Summit CD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Summit Holdings and is engaged in the business of, inter alia, manufacture of CDs and CD-ROMs. We shall refer to both of them jointly as the respondents.
The matter in dispute before us had its origin in 1997 and arose in the following manner. On 8 August 1997, BSA applied for and were granted two search warrants before a magistrate to search the premises of Summit Holdings for alleged copyright and trademark offences. Armed with the search warrants, the representatives of BSA, police officers and also lawyers from the law firm representing BSA, on 12 August 1997, carried out a raid on the premises. As the first two search warrants did not permit a seizure of documents, BSA applied for and were granted, on the same night, a third search warrant by GP Selvam J. Pursuant to these warrants, the raiding party seized and took away various documents from the premises of the respondents and five CD-ROMs alleged to contain copyright infringing programmes, stamper and two glass masters alleged to be used for the purposes of replicating CD-ROMs. The documents included internal memoranda of the staff, minutes and notes of meetings, invoices, sale orders and a log book. A list recording some of the customers of the respondents was allegedly downloaded from the computer system of the respondents and was seized and taken away also.
Immediately following the raid, on 13 August 1997, the appellants held a press conference at the premises of Summit Holdings and published or caused to be published to persons present thereat a press release. This press release later became the subject of proceedings in Suit 1323/98, to which we shall return in a moment.
The respondents being aggrieved by the raid carried out by the appellants instituted proceedings in CR 15/97 seeking an order to quash all the search warrants. BSA, for their part, applied by way of CM 17/97 for permission to make copies of documents and for an order that the respondents deliver up (i) copies of certain invoices issued to Category `C` customers who, the appellants alleged, were well known pirates, (ii) copies of warranties, indemnities signed by such customers, and (iii) a copy of each CD-ROM produced for such customers. Both the criminal revision and the criminal motion came on for hearing before the learned Chief Justice. On 29 September 1997, the learned Chief Justice made the following orders in respect of the criminal revision. He directed that the two warrants issued by the magistrate should stand but he quashed the third warrant issued by GP Selvam J on the ground, inter alia, that a High Court judge has no jurisdiction to sit as a magistrate or to make any order as a magistrate. Further, he ordered that all the documents and items seized pursuant to the third warrant and the documents and items seized outside the scope of the first two warrants be returned. The CM 17/97 taken out by BSA was dismissed. The grounds of his judgment were handed down on 13 October 1997: 
SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v PP and another action
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
 .
We now return to the Suit 1323/98. It was commenced by the respondents on 5 August 1998, which was about a year after the publication of the press release. In this suit, the respondents claim that certain words of the press release published or caused to be published at the press conference on 13 August 1997 defamed them, and attributed to the words complained of the meaning that the respondents were guilty of criminal conduct, namely, the systematic manufacturing of, and trading in, counterfeit CD-ROMs on such an extensive scale that they were responsible for the pirate CD-ROM trade in Southeast Asia. Soon after the commencement of the action, the respondents applied, inter alia, for (a) an order under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court determining the meaning of the words complained of as pleaded in the statement of claim, and (b) summary judgment under O 14 r 3. Prior to the hearing of the application, the appellants filed their joint defence in which they denied that the press release bore the meaning which the respondents had pleaded. More importantly, they pleaded justification and/or fair comment of the meaning which they said the passages complained of bore.
The application came on for hearing before an assistant registrar. At that hearing, a preliminary objection was raised by counsel for the respondents as to the references, in the joint defence and in the affidavits filed in opposition to the application, to documents and information obtained by the appellants pursuant to the search warrants, on the following grounds: 
(a) that there was an implied undertaking on the part of the appellants not to use such documents or information obtained in criminal proceedings in unconnected civil proceedings, as the information was confidential information on which the appellants could not rely without leave of court; and 
(b) even if there was no implied undertaking, it followed from the order made on 29 September 1997 directing that all documents and copies seized in the raid be returned to the respondents that the use of such documents and copies and information derived therefrom was impermissible.
The assistant registrar overruled the preliminary objection and held that the information obtained as a result of the raid and referred to in the joint defence and affidavits was admissible and should be allowed to stand. She then proceeded to consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of and came to the conclusion that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words was that the respondents were guilty of criminal conduct, namely, the systematic manufacture of and trading in counterfeit CD-ROMs on such an extensive scale that they were responsible for the pirate trade in Southeast Asia. Having dealt with these two issues, the assistant registrar granted leave to the appellants to amend the defence and adjourned the hearing to a later date. At the subsequent hearing the appellants tendered a proposed amended defence. At the end of the hearing, the assistant registrar granted the appellants unconditional leave to defend the action.
The respondents appealed to a judge-in-chambers against that part of the decision which allowed the appellants to use the documents and information obtained as a result of the raid. The appellants, for their part, appealed against the other part of the decision of the assistant registrar which determined the meaning of the words complained of. Both appeals were heard by Amarjeet Singh JC who upheld all the orders made by the assistant registrar. The parties then further appealed to the Court of Appeal. The respondents appealed in CA 39/99 against that part of the decision overruling the preliminary objection as to the use of the documents and information. The appellants, for their part, appealed against the other part of the decision which determined the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of. In that respect, two appeals were filed: CA 37/99 was taken out by Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk and Eckstrom, and CA 38/99 was taken out by BSA, Stuart Ong and Lee Cross. Both these appeals raised the same arguments, and all the three appeals were consolidated and heard together.
In the meantime, there was another important development that took place. The respondents complained that BSA had failed to return to them certain documents pursuant to the order made by the learned Chief Justice on 29 September 1999. They applied by way of CM 21/98 to commit BSA for contempt. The motion was heard before the learned Chief Justice, and at the conclusion of the hearing on 11 May 1999 he found that BSA was guilty of contempt in failing to comply fully with the orders made on 29 September 1997 and fined BSA for $5,000. The decision was given after the date on which Amarjeet Singh JC dismissed the appeals from the assistant registrar. In his grounds of judgment handed down on 31 May 1999, the learned Chief Justice further clarified the order he made on 29 September 1997: 
Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v Business Software Alliance
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 197
 .
After this decision of the learned Chief Justice, the three CA 37, 38 and 39/99 came on for hearing before the Court of Appeal. The court dismissed CA 37 and 38/99 (filed by the appellants) but allowed CA 39/99 (filed by the respondents): 
Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor and other appeals
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
 . The court held, inter alia, that: 
(1) the order made on 29 September 1997 in CR 15/97 and CM 17/97 prohibited the use of all documents and copies thereof obtained pursuant to the search warrants and information extracted from such documents or copies: [para ] 18-20 of the judgment; 
(2) aside from the order, there was an implied undertaking in criminal proceedings analogous to that arising on discovery in civil proceedings, which precluded the use of documents seized in the criminal proceedings for a collateral purpose, which includes unrelated civil proceedings; however, the implied undertaking was not absolute and could be varied in an appropriate case: [para ] 34-36 of the judgment.
Soon after the decision of the Court of Appeal, the appellants took out the present applications by way of CM 6 and 7/99 for the following orders: 
(1) that the order made on 29 September 1997 in CR 15/97 be varied to the extent and effect that the appellants be allowed to refer to and to rely on the documents and information referred to therein solely for the purposes of defending Suit 1323/98; 
(2) that the applicants be granted a release from or variation of the implied undertaking in respect of documents and information obtained pursuant to the execution of the search warrants solely for the purposes of defending Suit 1323/98; 
(3) that the applicants be permitted to retain, refer to and rely on the documents and information referred to and/or contained in all pleadings and affidavits filed and submissions made in the proceedings in Suit 1323/98; and 
(4) any consequential order that the court may think fit.
 Decision of the High Court 
 
 
 
The applications were heard before the learned Chief Justice on 27 October 1999 and at the conclusion of the hearing he dismissed them. He held that it is only in exceptional circumstances that the court would exercise its discretion to grant such applications and that the appellants had not shown any cogent and persuasive reasons as to why the applications should be allowed: see 
Microsoft Corporation & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 343
 . It is against this decision that the present two appeals are brought.
 Jurisdiction 
 
 
 
Before us the respondents raise a preliminary objection. It is submitted by counsel for the respondents that the appellants have no right of appeal against the order under appeal. Her grounds for saying so are briefly these. First, under s 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), there is no right of appeal from a judgment or order on a criminal matter, except as provided in the CPC or any other written law. The CPC itself gives no right of appeal from such order. The other written relevant law is the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) (`SCJA`), and SCJA itself also does not give any right of appeal from such order. Hence, the order under appeal is not appealable and the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear and determine these appeals.
There is some merit in this contention, and as we see it, this is a fundamental difficulty which the appellants have to overcome. In Singapore, there is no general right of appeal from a judgment or order of a criminal court except such as provided by law: 
Mohamed Razip & Ors v PP
 
 [1987] 2 SLR 142 
, 143. The authority for this proposition is s 241 of the CPC which provides: 
 
No appeal shall lie from a judgment, sentence or order of a criminal court except as provided for by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
Next, it is important to bear in mind that the Court of Appeal is a creature of legislation and its jurisdiction must necessarily be defined solely by and limited to the provisions of the legislation creating it: 
Abdullah bin A Rahman v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 129
 , 132. The relevant legislation is the SCJA, and the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is set out in ss 29A(2), 44, 59 and 60 of the Act. Section 29A(2) provides: 
 
The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought.
 
 
 
Section 44, in so far as relevant, provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the conviction or against the sentence or against both. 
 
(2) Where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea, there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. 
 
(3) ... 
 
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
 
(5) ...
  
 
 
Sections 59 and 60 of SCJA confer on the Court of Appeal the jurisdiction to determine any question of law referred to it by the High Court or the public prosecutor. Under s 59 the court has jurisdiction to determine any question of law referred to it by the High Court or the public prosecutor in a situation where a person has been convicted by the High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction. Section 60 provides that where a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court in exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, the judge may on application of any party and shall on application by the public prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the judge has affected the case. These two sections, strictly speaking, do not confer any right of appeal from any order of the High Court.
In considering the above statutory provisions two questions arise: first, whether the matters determined by the learned Chief Justice in CM 6 and 7/99 were criminal matters; and second if they were, whether the order which he made was one made by him in exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.
In the two criminal motions, the appellants essentially made two applications: (i) an application for a variation of the order made by the learned Chief Justice on 29 September 1997 in CR 15/97, and (ii) an application for a release or variation of the implied undertaking given to court. The nature of the first application turns on the order that was made by the learned Chief Justice on 29 September 1997. That order was made in a criminal revision under s 268 of the CPC and concerned the validity of three search warrants issued in criminal proceedings. The order was clearly one made in a criminal matter. Under the CPC there is no appeal against an order made by the High Court in exercise of such revisionary jurisdiction. Nor does the SCJA give any right of appeal against such an order. It therefore follows that when the application was made to the High Court to vary that order, the Chief Justice in refusing to vary it was similarly exercising the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. For the same reason, there is no appeal from such refusal and the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from that decision.
We now turn to the second application which was for a release from or variation of the implied undertaking in respect of documents and information obtained pursuant to the execution of the search warrants. These documents and information were disclosed under compulsion in criminal proceedings and the implied undertaking not to use these documents and information for a collateral purpose was given in those proceedings. In view of this, the subject matter of the application, which was for a release or variation of the undertaking, was a criminal matter, and the learned Chief Justice in dismissing the application for a release or variation of the undertaking was exercising the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.
The question therefore is whether there is any appeal from such an order. The CPC does not provide any right of appeal from such an order; and that much is clear. The next question is whether the order was one falling within s 29A(2) or s 44 of the SCJA. Considering first s 44, we do not think that section has any application here. It is s 29A(2) which is relevant. It raises a difficult point for consideration, and it is this: whether the refusal by the learned Chief Justice in giving the release or variation of the implied undertaking was an order made by him in exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. This is purely a matter of construction of s 29A(2). There are three decisions bearing on the point which we find of great assistance.
The first is the case of 
Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP
 
 [1984-1985] SLR 298 
. That was a case of an appeal against the refusal of the learned Chief Justice to reserve for the Court of Criminal Appeal some nine questions of law said to be of public interest which arose in the course of appeals from the magistrates` court which were determined by the learned Chief Justice. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the learned Chief Justice`s decision in refusing to reserve the questions of law was not a `decision of the High Court in exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction`. At that time, the relevant provision of the SCJA pertaining to this issue was s 44 which was as follows: 
 
 
(1) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any appeal against any decision made by the 
 High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction 
, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. 
 
(2) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the conviction or against the sentence or against both: Provided that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. 
 
(3) An appeal by the Public Prosecutor shall be either against the acquittal of an accused person or against the sentence imposed upon an accused person by the High Court. 
 
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
 
(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with section 59 or 66. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
Lai Kew Chai J in delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to s 44, said at p 304: 
 
In our view, the decision of the learned Chief Justice in refusing to reserve the questions of law was not a `decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction` within the meaning of that expression in s 44(1) of the Act. We are of the view that the Court of Criminal Appeal is a creature of the Act and it has no powers other than those conferred upon it by the Act. The decision was made after the conclusion of an appeal to the High Court in exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction and on the application of the appellants. To say that the learned Chief Justice was exercising the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court when he refused to reserve the questions of law is to extend the meaning and scope of the `original criminal jurisdiction` of the High Court to an extent quite out of line with the statutory framework for the administration of appellate criminal justice in Singapore.
 
 
 
The next case is 
Mohamed Razip & Ors v PP
 
 
[1987] SLR 142
 . There, three accused were charged with the offence of rape under s 376 of the Penal Code and they applied to the High Court under s 354 of the CPC for bail pending trial, but their applications were dismissed. They appealed. In dismissing the appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the jurisdiction of the court to hear appeals is limited to hearing appeals against orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence or acquittal. An order on bail is not such a decision and does not fall within the purview of s 44 of the SCJA. Wee Chong Jin CJ in delivering the judgment of the court said that the `key words` in s 44(1) were `any decision made by the High Court in exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction`. He compared s 44 then in force with its predecessor, prior to the amendments made in 1973 and said at p 144: 
 
It is plain from the legislative history of all these sections that the words `any decision made by the High Court` in s 44(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act were inserted to accommodate appeals by the Public Prosecutor, thereby enlarging the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal in that respect. The words were, in our opinion, not inserted as a `catch-all` phrase. They must be read in the context of the other provisions. In s 44(2), the appellant is the `person convicted` and the appeal is against conviction, or sentence, or both. In s 44(3), the appellant is the Public Prosecutor and the appeal is against acquittal, or sentence. Even when questions of law are referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 59 or 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, they are done only at the conclusion of the trial or the appeal, as the case may be. The only logical conclusion, therefore, is that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is to hear appeals against orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence, or acquittal.
 
 
 
The SCJA was subsequently amended by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1993. By the amendments, among other things, s 44 has been recast in that sub-s (1) thereof, with necessary modifications, is now found in s 29A(2), and the remaining sub-ss (2) to (5) are now sub-ss (1) to (4) of s 44. No material changes have been made to s 44.
Since the amendments, there was decided by the Court of Appeal the case of 
Ang Cheng Hai & Ors v PP and another appeal
 
 [1995] SLR 201 
. It was there held that the decision of the High Court in refusing an application under s 185 of the CPC to transfer certain proceedings from the District Court to the High Court is not an order falling within s 29A(2) of the SCJA. Karthigesu JA in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 205: 
 
The concept of `original jurisdiction` has been defined to mean `jurisdiction to consider a case in the first instance ... to take cognizance of a cause at its inception, try it and pass judgment upon the law and facts`: 
 Black`s Law Dictionary
 (6th Ed). In 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP
, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed (at p 457):
 
 
 
`The all-embracing original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court under s 15 of the [Supreme Court of Judicature] Act is not in all cases exercised by the High Court but the administration of criminal justice in respect of what we may call the less serious criminal cases, generally those cases not involving the sentence of death or life imprisonment, is entrusted to the subordinate courts. The exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court involves generally the more serious criminal cases or such less serious criminal cases as may be transferred from the subordinate courts to the High Court.`
 
 
 
It is implicit from the above dicta that `original jurisdiction` refers to original trial jurisdiction. In respect of the High Court, its original criminal jurisdiction is enumerated under s 15 SCJA, which denotes its trial jurisdiction. For this reason, the dictum of Coomaraswamy J did not assist the appellants. In the present cases, as the prosecution rightly pointed out, there was no trial which had commenced in the High Court. The High Court had not yet taken cognizance of the offences in question. The only matters before the High Court were the applications under s 185 CPC. We recognized that both the magistrate`s court and the High Court may have been jurisdictionally competent to try the offences in question. Nevertheless, the proceedings had been validly commenced in a magistrate`s court, which had properly taken cognizance of the offences and had proceeded to exercise original criminal jurisdiction.
 
 
 
The learned judge next referred to 
 Mohamed Razip 
 (supra) and said: 
 
We turned to consider the prosecution`s submissions. Sections 29A(2) and 44 SCJA are the key provisions relating to the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. While s 44(1) of the pre-existing SCJA may have been deleted and recast as s 29A(2) SCJA, the remaining sub-ss (2) to (5) in s 44 have been retained without any amendment. This clearly indicates that the reasoning and conclusion of the Court of Appeal in 
 Mohamed Razip
 [supra] remain applicable. Accordingly, we agreed with the prosecution`s submission that the Court of Appeal is generally empowered only to entertain appeals which are concerned with orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence or acquittal. On this premise, Rubin J`s decision did not give rise to a right of appeal.
 
 
 
Following these decisions, we are of the opinion, the words `original criminal jurisdiction` in s 29A(2) of the SCJA, on the true construction, refer to `trial jurisdiction` and the decision of the learned Chief Justice in refusing to release or vary the implied undertaking was not an order made in exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court within the meaning of s 29A(2) of the SCJA. Therefore, no appeal lies from that order and this court has no jurisdiction to hear these appeals. In the event, we do not find it necessary to consider the merits of the appeals. Accordingly the appeals are dismissed with costs. The deposits in court as security are to be paid to the respondents or their solicitors to account of costs.

: This was a petition by a young person, as defined by the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38) (`CYPA`), for the court to exercise its power of revision to quash the finding of guilt or alter the order given in the court below on the ground of 
 autrefois convict 
 or abuse of process.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The petitioner was 15 years old at the time of the petition. He committed his first set of offences at age 13, and was found guilty of two counts of theft of motor cycle under s 379A of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one count of fraudulent possession of helmet under s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) on 26 May 1998. Three further counts of theft of motor cycle were taken into consideration. For these offences, he was ordered to reside in an approved school, the Salvation Army Gracehaven (`Gracehaven`) for 24 months, commencing on 26 May 1998 (`the first order`).
The approved school regime provides a structured and disciplined environment for rehabilitation. Juveniles who are sent to an approved school generally have committed serious offences and exhibit a need for an institutional environment, whether because of problems at home, association with undesirable peers or active membership in secret societies.
There are presently five approved schools, which differ in the strictness of their regime and in the tightness of their security. At the more liberal end of the spectrum are two approved schools run by voluntary welfare organisations: Muhammadiyah Welfare Home and Gracehaven. Those who are sent to Gracehaven tend to be those who need institutional care but who do not have serious delinquent traits. Residents of Gracehaven are allowed to attend school and to work outside the home. After the first few months, home leave on the weekends is granted to those who show positive behaviour.
Further along the spectrum are two approved schools run by the Ministry of Community Development and Sports. They are the Toa Payoh Girls` Home and the Singapore Boys` Home (`SBH`). Juveniles who are sent to these homes tend to exhibit a greater degree of delinquency compared to those who are sent to Muhammadiyah Welfare Home or Gracehaven. The strictest regime and tightest security is found at the Reformative Training Center (`RTC`), run by the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
On 25 November 1999, the Superintendent of Gracehaven (`the superintendent`) instituted breach proceedings under s 44(2)(a) of the CYPA (`the breach proceedings`) against the petitioner. The provision states: 
 
Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied, on the representations of the manager of a place of detention, an approved school or an approved home, that a person ordered to be detained in the place of detention, approved school or approved home is of so unruly a character that he cannot be so detained, the Court may -
 
 
 
 
(a) order the person to be transferred to and detained in an approved school or in another approved school, as the case may be, which the Court considers more suitable for him and to be detained there for the whole or any part of the unexpired period of detention;
  
 
 
The juvenile court called for a progress report. In the report, presented on 14 December 1999, the superintendent stated that while the petitioner behaved reasonably well under the supervision of the home, he had serious problems when outside home supervision. The latter occurred more often than desired in view of his frequent abscondence from the home, which in all totalled 71 days. While at large, the petitioner would associate freely with undesirable peers, staying overnight with them, smoking and loitering in the streets aimlessly, as well as engaging in sex with a female resident of the home. The superintendent was of the view that the petitioner would benefit from staying in a more regimented environment with closer supervision. The juvenile court accepted the recommendation and transferred the petitioner to SBH for the unexpired period of the first order.
On 27 January 2000, the petitioner was charged with three counts of carnal connection with a girl under 16 years (the female resident of the home), an offence under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353). Two further counts of s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter were taken into consideration.
 Decision of the juvenile court 
 
 
 
At the carnal connection proceedings, the petitioner asked to be allowed to stay in SBH. The juvenile court exercised its power under s 44(1)(g) of the CYPA and ordered the petitioner to be sent to SBH for 24 months (`the second order`).
 The petition 
 
 
 
Subsequently, a petition was made to this court, asking it to exercise its power of revision to quash the finding of guilt made in respect of the carnal connection charges or alternatively to alter the second order by reducing the period of residence at SBH. Two arguments were canvassed in support of the petition: 
 autrefois convict 
 and abuse of process.
 Autrefois convict 
 
 
 
The petitioner`s chief argument was that of autrefois convict. This common law principle is enshrined in art 11(2) of the Constitution, which states: 
 
A person who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence shall not be tried again for the same offence except where the conviction or acquittal has been quashed and a retrial ordered by a court superior to that by which he was convicted or acquitted.
 
 
 
The House of Lords had the opportunity to consider this doctrine in an extensive manner in 
Connelly v DPP
 
[1964] AC 1254
[1964] 2 All ER 401
. In a much cited passage in 
 Connelly 
 at 
[1964] AC 1254
, 1305; [1964] 2 All ER 401, 412, Lord Morris set out nine propositions which in his view `both principle and authority establish`. Of direct relevance to this case are the following: 
 
 
(1) that a man cannot be tried for a crime in respect of which he has previously been acquitted or convicted; 
 
(2) ... 
 
(3) that the same rule applies if the crime in respect of which he is being charged is in effect the same, or is substantially the same, as either the principal or a different crime in respect of which he has been acquitted or could have been convicted; 
 
(4) that one test as to whether the rule applies is whether the evidence which is necessary to support the second indictment, or whether the facts which constitute the second offence, would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first indictment either as to the offences charged or as to an offence of which, on the indictment, the accused could have been found guilty ...
  
 
 
As Lord Bridge observed in 
Lee Wee Harry v Law Society of Singapore
 
 SLR 41 
 at p 47, in 
 Connelly 
, Lord Devlin had a different view from Lord Morris. He took a stricter view of 
 autrefois convict 
 and said that for the doctrine to apply it must be the same offence in both fact and law, and not merely where the offences were substantially the same. His Lordship`s difficulty was with the idea that an offence may be substantially the same as another in its legal characteristics, since in his view legal characteristics are precise things and are either the same or not. Lord Bridge did not find it necessary in 
 Lee Wee Harry 
to find which view was correct, and neither was it necessary here. Even on Lord Morris` more liberal test of substantial similarity of offence in both fact and law, the petitioner`s argument of 
 autrefois convict 
 failed.
The 
 autrefois convict 
 argument presented before me by counsel for petitioner rested on three propositions, of which the first two were crucial to the petitioner: 
(a) the five instances of carnal connection with a girl under 16 years were included as elements of misconduct in the breach proceedings brought under s 44(2)(a) of the CYPA by the superintendent of Gracehaven; 
(b) when the juvenile court adjudicated upon the breach proceedings and made an order to transfer the petitioner to SBH for the unexpired period of the first order, the petitioner was duly convicted of the offences relating to carnal connection; 
(c) the finding of guilt made at the carnal connection proceedings on 27 January 2000 amounted to a second conviction on substantially the same facts, thereby violating art 11(2) of the Constitution.
Proposition (a) misunderstood the representations made by the superintendent of Gracehaven at the breach proceedings. The petitioner`s sexual relationship with a resident of Gracehaven was mentioned twice in the progress report. In her report, the Senior Social Worker at Gracehaven commented that the petitioner`s abscondence was motivated by the desire to be with a female resident and to spend time with her. It was in the context of explaining the intensity of this relationship that the petitioner`s sexual relationship with that female resident was mentioned. The focus of concern was the petitioner`s abscondence and not the sexual relationship.
Similarly, when the superintendent noted in her report that the petitioner was having sex with a resident, this was mentioned in the context of things that the petitioner engaged in while at large. The concern was again with the petitioner`s abscondence: on the violence exhibited in forcing his way out and the activities engaged in while away from the home. From the superintendent`s statements, it was clear that her primary concern while the petitioner was at large was not the sexual relationship but the undesirable peer influence.
Thus, while it was true that the petitioner`s sexual relationship with a resident was mentioned at the breach proceedings, it was not presented as an element of misconduct to satisfy the unruly character requirement of s 44(2)(a). Instead it was mentioned to highlight to the juvenile court the frustrations and motivations that were affecting the petitioner, which led to what was of the utmost concern to the home: his frequent abscondence and the bad peer influence he was under while at large.
The misunderstanding reflected in proposition (a) was in large part due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the breach proceedings. The breach proceedings are not an adjudication on the legality of the juvenile`s actions while at the home. They are for the juvenile court to transfer the juvenile to another approved school if the court is satisfied that this would be more suitable for the juvenile. Hence, the requirement to be satisfied under s 44(2)(a) is not proof of an offence, but merely that the juvenile is of so 
 unruly a character that he cannot be detained 
 at the original approved school. In the petitioner`s case, amongst other things, the lack of a secured compound and close supervision made Gracehaven unsuitable for a juvenile who was prone to running away.
Consequently, proposition (b) was also incorrect. When the juvenile court ordered that the petitioner be transferred to SBH for the unexpired period of the first order, the court was not adjudicating on the carnal connection offences, but on the 
 continued suitability 
 of Gracehaven as an institution of rehabilitation for the petitioner in relation to an approved school order made in respect of 
 prior 
 property offences. Therefore, the order sending the petitioner to SBH for the unexpired period of the first order in no sense amounted to a conviction.
The weight of caselaw supports the dismissal of the petitioner`s plea of of autrefois convict. In 
Lim Keng Chia v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 686
 , a decision of this court, the petitioner for revision had argued that a detention order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) barred a subsequent charge for consumption of a controlled drug in respect of the same incident. It was held that the detention order was not a conviction that would bar the subsequent charge. It was noted at [para ] 14: 
 
... all that was required for a detention order to be made against the petitioner under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that the Director of the CNB be satisfied that it was `necessary` for the petitioner to `undergo treatment or rehabilitation or both at an approved institution`. To paraphrase Abdoolcader J [in 
Yeap Hock Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia & Ors
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 279
 ], in the making of the detention order, there was no question of any specific offence being identified as having been committed by the petitioner and certainly no question of the petitioner being tried on any particular charge. In short, I could see no basis for saying that the detention order made against the petitioner on 30 January 1996 amounted to a criminal conviction. In my view, therefore, the conviction sustained by the petitioner on 19 September 1997 could not be said to constitute an instance of `double jeopardy.
 
 
 
Similarly in this case, there was no question of any specific offence being identified as having been committed by the petitioner at the breach proceedings. Nor was there any question of the petitioner being tried on any particular charge.
In the context of disciplinary proceedings, it was argued before a court of three judges in 
Law Society of Singapore v Edmund Nathan
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 414
  that a finding by an inquiry committee of improper conduct by the respondent barred show cause proceedings against him concerning the same incident. The court held that the plea of
 autrefois convict 
 did not apply because the finding by the inquiry committee did not amount to a conviction of the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by Karthigesu JA, who said at [para ] 24: 
 
most important of all the proceedings before the inquiry committee was not a trial. The respondent was not called upon to answer a specific charge. He was only called upon to explain his conduct in relation to the complaint made against him.
 
 
 
Similarly in this case, the petitioner was not called upon to answer a specific charge. What the breach proceedings did involve was representations made by the manager of the approved school regarding the continued suitability of detaining the petitioner at the home.
In summary, the claim of
 autrefois convict 
 failed because the breach proceedings did not concern facts or offences that were even substantially similar to that of the carnal connection proceedings on 27 January 2000, and because the breach proceedings did not involve the trial of a specific charge but the determination of the continued suitability of the petitioner at the home based on representations made by the manager of the home. The order sending the petitioner to SBH for the unexpired period of the first order was consequently merely a transfer order and did not amount to a conviction. The second order imposed on the petitioner therefore could not be said to be a second conviction on substantially the same facts or offence.
 Abuse of process 
 
 
 
The other argument raised by the petitioner was abuse of process. This was Lord Devlin`s alternative approach to 
 autrefois convict 
 in 
 Connelly 
. Under this approach, the court has a discretionary power to quash or stay an indictment which to try would be oppressive to the accused.
The petitioner`s abuse of process argument was essentially built on two unrelated planks: 
(a) that there was procedural irregularity in that the breach proceedings should only have commenced after or concurrently with the carnal connection proceedings; 
(b) that the failure to stay the breach proceedings till after the carnal connection proceedings or to have it heard concurrently prejudiced the petitioner in his defence at the carnal connection proceedings.
The petitioner argued that there was procedural irregularity in having the breach proceedings commence before the carnal connection proceedings because this court had said in 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
  that it is desirable that an offender be dealt with at the same time for both the breach of the probation order and the subsequent offence.
Such an application of 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 was totally out of context. That case involved the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252). Under s 7 of that Act, if the requirements of the probation order are breached, the court has the power to deal with the probationer as if it had just convicted him of the offence for which the probation order was made. In 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
, the probation order was breached as a result of the probationer`s committal of a second offence. The probationer was sentenced to undergo reformative training for that second offence. At the subsequent breach proceedings for the probation order given for the first offence, the district judge sentenced the probationer to 18 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, the sentence to begin after the completion of the reformative training. At the appeal against sentence, this court noted that a lengthy prison term and caning after the reformative training would run counter to what reformative training aimed to do. It was in this context that this court said that in order to avoid similar difficulties arising, the probationer should ideally be dealt with for his breach of probation order and his subsequent offence at the same time.
First of all, it should be noted that the dicta in 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 was an expression of a desired situation. It was not stated that it was procedurally improper for breach of probation proceedings to be conducted after the proceedings for the subsequent offence. On the contrary, it was noted that this might be unavoidable under the regime laid out by the Probation of Offenders Act, in situations where the order for probation was made by a court other than a magistrate`s court. It was then suggested that in such a situation, the court, in dealing with the offender for the subsequent offence, should have regard to the fact that the offender would later have to be dealt with for the offence for which he had been given probation, as the sentence passed for the subsequent offence could restrict the type of sentence passed by the court dealing later with the breach of probation.
Second, the rationale for dealing with the probationer`s breach and the subsequent offence at the same time is to allow the judge to be cognisant of the potential sentence for the initial offence for which probation was given as well as the potential sentence for the subsequent offence, thereby ensuring that the sentences that are passed for both offences are not contrary to each other.
Such rationale is not applicable to s 44(2)(a) breach proceedings. This is because the extent of judicial discretion in breach proceedings under s 44(2)(a) of the CYPA is vastly different from the extent of judicial discretion in breach proceedings under s 7 of the Probation of Offenders Act. In the latter case, the judge is empowered to sentence the probationer afresh and hence draw on a variety of sentencing options. In the former case, the judge`s power is narrowly limited to transferring the juvenile to another approved school. He cannot extend the period of detention, nor can he make a different order. Consequently, even if breach proceedings under s 44(2)(a) of the CYPA are stayed until after the proceedings for the subsequent offence so that the judge is aware of the sentence for the second offence, he would still not be able to make much use of that knowledge since all he can do in respect of s 44(2)(a) breach proceedings is to decide whether to transfer the juvenile to another approved school. There is therefore little utility from mandating that s 44(2)(a) breach proceedings be conducted concurrently with or after the subsequent offence proceedings, and there is nothing that makes it procedurally improper if the juvenile court does not do so.
The second plank of the petitioner`s abuse of process argument was that the failure to stay the breach proceedings till after the carnal connection proceedings or to have it heard concurrently prejudiced the petitioner in his defence at the carnal connection proceedings. This was because his admission to the breach at the breach proceedings ruled out the availability of the defence under s 140(5) of the Women`s Charter that there was reasonable cause to believe that the girl was above the age of 16 years.
I had several difficulties with this argument. One difficulty was the fact that, as mentioned, the breach proceedings did not focus on the petitioner`s carnal connection offences, but on his frequent absconding and his activities while at large. Therefore, while it was clear that when the petitioner admitted to the breach he was admitting to absconding for a total of 71 days, it was far more difficult to conclude from the court record that he was admitting to the sexual relationships. Moreover, all that was mentioned in the progress report was that the petitioner had sexual relationships with a female resident of the home. There was no indication of the female resident`s age, nor whether the petitioner knew what her age was. Therefore, even if there was an admission to sexual relationships, such an admission was confined to the fact of having sexual relationships alone and did not preclude a defence of reasonable belief that the girl was under 16 years of age. Finally, it was difficult to see how the alleged prejudice could take the form of ruling out a defence of reasonable cause of belief that the girl was over 16 years. Such a defence would have been extremely unrealistic for the petitioner in view of the fact that they were both residents in a home for juveniles and the fact that they knew each other very well.
In order for the court to quash the petitioner`s finding of guilt on the ground of abuse of process, the petitioner had to show that the bringing of the carnal connection proceedings against him was oppressive. This the petitioner tried to do unsuccessfully, by asserting procedural irregularity on the basis of a decision that was taken wholly out of context, and by asserting the suffering of prejudice which was not demonstrated.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In view of these reasons, the petition was dismissed. I should add that when the legal arguments are said and done, what lies at the heart of this matter is the boy and his future. At the breach proceedings, he expressed a desire to change. At the carnal connection proceedings, he expressed a desire to carry on staying in SBH. It is hoped that the engaging of a lawyer to make this petition has not created any sense of self-righteousness, false pride or increased rebelliousness. It would be sad if in the process of seeking the help of the law, that process diminished in any way the hope and desire to change.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 28 January 2000, the two appellants were convicted and sentenced to death by Justice Kan Ting Chiu (`the trial judge`) under separate charges of drug trafficking. Both the appellants appealed against their conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeals and now give our reasons.
The appellants were jointly tried in the High Court and were originally jointly charged with being a party to a criminal conspiracy to traffic 60.17g of diamorphine. The original joint charge read as follows: 
 
That you, [1] Sharom bin Ahmad [2] Boksenang bin Bochek, on or about 19 March 1999, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy, and in such capacity, agreed with one another to do an illegal act, namely, to traffic in diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), whereby you were both in possession of 60.17 grams of diamorphine at Block 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 [num ]12-1131 for the purposes of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 120B(1) of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the trial and after hearing the submissions of the prosecution and the defence, the learned trial judge held that there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the two appellants as contemplated by the joint charge. However, as the trial judge was of the view that other offences have been made out on the evidence, he substituted the joint charge with two separate charges, one against each of the appellants. The new charge against the first appellant was as follows: 
 
You, Sharom bin Ahmad, are charged that you on or about 20 March 1999, at about 8.30pm at Block 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 [num ]12-1131, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 60.17 grams of diamorphine without authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
The substituted charge against the second appellant read: 
 
You, Boksenang bin Bochek, are charged that you on or about 19 March 1999, between 9.20am and 11.00am at Block 520 Jelapang Road [num ]03-289, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185) by selling not less than 59.95 grams of diamorphine to one Sharom bin Ahmad without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
The substituted charges were read and explained to the two appellants who claimed trial to their respective charges. The trial judge then invited the prosecution and counsel for the appellants to recall any witnesses or call any further witnesses they wished to examine and to make submissions on the substituted charges. All the parties declined to call any witnesses and counsel for the appellants made only short oral submissions on the new charges.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
On 20 March 1999, a surveillance exercise was conducted by the officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) at the Costa Sands Chalets at Pasir Ris. The CNB officers were keeping watch on the first appellant, Sharom bin Ahmad (`Sharom`), who is also known as `Boy Dol` or `Boy`. The CNB officers believed that Sharom was using a 125cc chopper motorcycle with the licence plate FQ9032M. At around 4.10pm, Sharom and his girlfriend, Norsila bte Mohd (`Norsila`) were seen leaving the chalets on the said motorcycle. Sharom was wearing a black jacket with white pants while Norsila was described as wearing a blue t-shirt with black pants. The couple were followed by the CNB officers who trailed them as they first went to Tampines Street 34, then to Century Square Shopping Centre at Tampines Central 1. After leaving Century Square, the couple went to Blk 86 Bedok North Street 4 before they finally proceeded to Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 and parked the motorcycle FQ9032M in the car park at around 7.15pm. The CNB officers observed the couple leaving the motorcycle, carrying plastic shopping bags and walking towards Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. They were seen taking the lift in Blk 420 up to the 11th floor. At about 8.25pm, the couple were spotted coming down from the 12th floor staircase to the 11th floor lift landing and going inside the lift. Soon after, they were seen approaching the motorcycle FQ9032M at the car park and were about to leave when the CNB officers moved in to arrest them.
Upon being confronted by the CNB officers, Sharom refused to stay still and tried to move away before the officers handcuffed him. It was observed that Sharom was nervous and shivering and he had since changed his clothing. Sharom was questioned about where they had come from, whereupon he lied and said that he and Norsila just came from the coffee shop in the next block. When asked where did he change his clothes, Sharom again lied and said that he did it at the fifth floor of the next block. A body search was conducted on Sharom and a `Marlboro` cigarette box containing one sachet of powdery substance was found tucked at his waistband. The substance was later analysed and found to contain diamorphine. A key chain with a fur ball and holding four keys was also recovered from Sharom. He was asked whether the keys belonged to him and he admitted that they did. Sharom was then asked where his identity card (`NRIC`) was and his reply was that it was in his wallet. When his wallet was searched, a NRIC belonging to one Amran Bin Adahar, NRIC No. 1674423/I, was found. He was asked whether this was his NRIC and he nodded and replied `yes`. He also responded when he was called `Amran` by the CNB officers. Sharom only admitted later that the NRIC did not belong to him and Amran Bin Adahar was actually his brother-in-law.
Thereafter, the CNB officers took Sharom and Norsila up to the 12th floor of Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. The bunch of keys seized from Sharom was then tried from house to house to locate which unit the keys belonged to. Sharom was questioned as to which unit on the 12th floor he had come from and which unit the keys belonged to. Sharom replied that he did not stay on the 12th floor and the keys were not for that block. This was, however, soon proven untrue and the seized keys were used to access unit [num ]12-1131 of Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio (the `Ang Mo Kio flat`). It was later established that the Ang Mo Kio flat belonged to the second appellant, Boksenang bin Bochek, who had rented the unit from the Housing and Development Board. The CNB officers then conducted a search of the one-room flat in the presence of Sharom and Norsila.
A number of items were found and seized in the premises. A green and black haversack was recovered in the corner of the bedroom area, next to the wardrobe. Ten packets of granular substance were found in the main compartment of the haversack and two sachets of substance were found in the front compartment. All these substances were later analysed to contain diamorphine. Cash amounting to $1112 was also recovered from the haversack. When the haversack and its contents were placed before Sharom, he appeared distressed and he knelt down with his head on the floor and seemed to be crying. Sharom was asked about the haversack and its contents. 
 
 
Q: What is this, ten packets? 
 
A: It is heroin. 
 
Q: Whose is this? 
 
A: I do not know. I do not know how this is here. 
 
Q: Is the bag yours? 
 
A: The bag is mine. 
 
Q: Are the two sachets yours? 
 
A: No, they are not.
  
 
 
A white plastic bag was also recovered from under the sink in the kitchen of the Ang Mo Kio flat. The white plastic bag contained in it 21 empty sachets, a TANITA digital weighing scale and a sachet of granular substance inside a `Marlboro` cigarette box. The sachet of granular substance was later analysed and found to contain diamorphine. Sharom was asked whether the items in the white plastic bag belonged to him and he admitted that they were all his. The CNB officers further found clothes similar to what Sharom and Norsila were wearing earlier soaking in a pail in the toilet and a motorcycle cover belonging to Sharom lying on the floor in the hall area. Sharom was questioned on who the owner of the Ang Mo Kio flat was and how many people were staying in it. Sharom`s reply was that the house belonged to `Bob` and that `Bob` stayed in the flat with his wife.
Subsequently, Sharom and Norsila were brought by the CNB officers to two other places which were also searched. The first was Blk 80 Bedok North Road [num ]02-268, which was the address shown in Sharom`s NRIC, and the second was Blk 195 Kim Keat Avenue [num ]04-324, which Sharom claimed he had rented and was staying at with Norsila. The search in these two premises did not recover any incriminating evidence. At around the same time, other CNB officers also raided chalets B9 and B10 of the Costa Sands Chalets, with the intention of arresting the second appellant, Boksenang bin Bochek (`Boksenang`). However, he was not arrested on that day.
Boksenang, who is also known as `Bob senang` or `Bob`, evaded arrest until 28 July 1999. On that day, at around 5pm, he was spotted near a Baby and Child Medical Clinic at Blk 828 Tampines Street 81 and was subsequently arrested there. A body search of Boksenang was conducted and nothing incriminating was found on him.
 Scientific analysis of the substance seized 
 
 
 
The various sachets and packets of substance seized on 20 March 1999 from Sharom and the Ang Mo Kio flat were sent for analysis by the Department of Scientific Services. The analyses revealed the following results: 
(i) The one sachet of substance found on Sharom himself had a gross weight of 4.96g and contained 0.34g of diamorphine. 
(ii) The one sachet of substance found in the white plastic bag in the kitchen of the Ang Mo Kio flat had a gross weight of 2.36g and contained 0.15g of diamorphine. 
(iii) The ten packets of granular substance found in the haversack was of a gross weight of 4,605g and contained not less than 59.94g of diamorphine. 
(iv) The two sachets of granular substance found in the haversack was of a gross weight of 23.12g and contained 0.23g of diamorphine.
 Sharom`s defence 
 
 
 
A cautioned statement and four long statements were made by Sharom in the course of the investigations. He did not challenge the admissibility of any of the statements. In his statements, Sharom affirmed that the haversack belonged to him. However, he adamantly maintained throughout that the ten packets and two sachets of drugs found in the haversack were not his but belonged instead to Boksenang, who was also the owner of the Ang Mo Kio flat in which the haversack had been found. According to Sharom, Boksenang had borrowed the haversack from him on the Sunday before his arrest, ie on 14 March 1999, and Boksenang must have used it to contain the drugs. Sharom claimed that he had no knowledge of the drugs being placed in the haversack and neither was he aware that the haversack was in the Ang Mo Kio flat.
He sought to dissociate himself from the Ang Mo Kio flat and asserted that he was staying with Norsila at a rented room in Blk 195 Kim Keat Ave since January 1999 till the time of his arrest. Prior to his arrest on 20 March 1999, he had been to the Ang Mo Kio flat only on three occasions, the first being on 14 March 1999 (Sunday), second time on 18 March (Thursday) and the last time on 19 March (Friday). On the morning of 14 March 1999, Boksenang had invited him and Norsila to the Ang Mo Kio flat. They went to the flat and met Boksenang, his wife - Lisfah, Lisfah`s sister - Hamidah, a Mohamed Hussain and his girlfriend there. He was at the flat with Norsila until around 4 to 5pm and as they were about to leave, Boksenang asked to borrow Sharom`s haversack which he was carrying at that time. Sharom lent the haversack to Boksenang after removing his and Norsila`s personal belongings from it. In his oral evidence, Sharom claimed that the next occasion he was at the Ang Mo Kio flat was on 18 March 1999 (Thursday). Although this was inconsistent with his earlier account in one of his long statements where he had said that he stayed at the Ang Mo Kio flat `from Monday till Friday morning`, he claimed in his oral testimony that the earlier statement was a mistake as he was confused at the time he was making it. According to him, he and Norsila had gone to the flat on Thursday upon Boksenang`s invitation and had spent the night there with Boksenang, Lisfah and Hamidah. When Sharom was at the Ang Mo Kio flat on Thursday night, he was invited by Boksenang to go to Blk 520 Jelapang Road [num ]03-289 (`the Jelapang flat`) on Friday morning as Boksenang had arranged to meet a friend there. Boksenang had been renting a room in the Jelapang flat since December 1998. He decided to go along as he wanted to replenish his stock of heroin from Mohamed Hussain (`Hussain`), who was also renting a room in the Jelapang flat.
On Friday morning, 19 March 1999, Sharom left the Ang Mo Kio flat on his motorcycle for the Jelapang flat, while Boksenang and Lisfah made their way there in a taxi. Norsila and Hamidah stayed behind in the Ang Mo Kio flat. After he arrived at the Jelapang flat he went into Boksenang`s room and slept there. He was awakened later by Boksenang who said that his friend, Bai (also known as `Bujang` or `Bob`), had arrived. He was still in the room when Bai came in, carrying a red shopping bag. Boksenang then told him to leave the room and so he went to Hussain`s room where he smoked heroin with Hussain. After about 10 to 15 minutes, he returned to Boksenang`s room and saw the red shopping bag on the floor of the room. He observed that the shopping bag contained packets of heroin and he took out three packets to examine them. In his defence, Sharom stated his belief that the heroin in the haversack belonged to Boksenang as the packets of heroin in the haversack looked very much like the ones he had examined in Boksenang`s room in the Jelapang flat. After handling the packets of heroin, he placed them back into the red shopping bag and thereafter returned to Hussain`s room to smoke more heroin. Bai and Boksenang remained in the room and were smoking heroin as well. He stayed at the Jelapang flat until about 6.00pm before leaving and returning to the Ang Mo Kio flat.
After arriving at the Ang Mo Kio flat, Sharom stayed only for a short while, after which he left with Norsila to go to Norsila`s mother`s house at Teban Gardens. They left Teban Gardens at around 10.15pm that Friday night and made their way to Costa Sands Chalets where Boksenang and Lisfah were celebrating their birthdays. Boksenang had booked a few chalets for the occasion and had invited relatives and friends to join in the celebrations. He and Norsila spent the night at the chalets. The next day, on 20 March 1999, he told Boksenang that he wanted to go to the Ang Mo Kio flat to retrieve a sachet of heroin he had kept in the kitchen. He had obtained this sachet from Hussain at the Jelapang flat on the previous day. Boksenang then handed to him the bunch of keys for the Ang Mo Kio flat and this was the first time Boksenang was lending the keys to him. At that time, Norsila was also present when the keys were being borrowed. After taking the keys, he left the chalets with Norsila on his motorcycle and they first went to his sister`s place at Tampines before going to Tampines Mall where the two of them bought some clothes for themselves. After their shopping, they went to Bedok North where he had his haircut and subsequently they proceeded to the Ang Mo Kio flat. At the Ang Mo Kio flat, he retrieved the sachet of heroin he had kept in the kitchen and smoked some of it with Norsila. He then split the remaining heroin into two sachets, placing them in two separate `Marlboro` cigarette boxes. He put one of the cigarette boxes into the white plastic bag which he then placed under the sink in the kitchen while he kept the other box with him. In the meantime, Norsila tidied up the kitchen and cooked some food. She then took a shower and they both changed into the new clothes they had just bought, soaking their old clothing in a pail in the toilet. Soon after, they received a call from Boksenang asking them when they were returning to the chalets. They then left the Ang Mo Kio flat to return to the chalets, locking up the flat with the keys that Boksenang had lent to him. They were about to leave the car park when they were arrested by the CNB officers.
 Evidence against Boksenang 
 
 
 
In establishing its case against Boksenang, the prosecution relied essentially on the confession made by him in one of the long statements recorded from him (`P47`). Boksenang had made a cautioned statement and three long statements to the CNB officers and he agreed that the three earlier statements were made voluntarily. However, he challenged the admissibility of the last long statement he made on 11 August 1999 (ie P47) on the ground that it had been procured as a result of inducement, threat and promise. Boksenang alleged that the investigating officer, Insp A Muruganandam (`Insp Muru`), had threatened to arrest his wife and to detain him indefinitely unless he made a proper statement. Insp Muru later induced him by saying that he would allow him the special privilege of seeing his wife and the inspector further promised that he would try to get the charge reduced to a non-capital charge. As a result of Boksenang`s allegations, a voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of P47. At the end of the voir dire, the trial judge made the finding that there was no inducement, threat or promise and that the statement was made voluntarily. Consequently, P47 was admitted as evidence. It is useful to reproduce here the relevant parts of P47 that were relied on by the prosecution. In P47, Boksenang said: 
 
 
12 I am now referred to a photograph in a album showing a green bag and I am also shown a green bag physically. (Recorder`s Note: Accused was shown album showing a green haversack marked as A and also the same green haversack bag seized from accused Sharom Bin Ahmad on 20 March 1999 at Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10). I can identify the bag as that which I have seen Boy Dol carrying with him all the time that I have met him. The bag does not belong to me and I have never taken custody of the bag from Boy Dol at any time. I am very sure that the bag belongs to Boy Dol and I am aware that there were money in the side pocket of the bag when Boy Dol came to see me at Blk 520 Jelapang Road on the Friday before my birthday. I know that there was more than $1,000 in the bag and if that is my money why haven`t I removed it and kept it with me. 
 
13 Boy Dol visited me at Blk 520 Jelapang Road in my rented room on this day. Boy Dol visited me in the morning at about 9 to 10 am and I was in the room with my wife and I was waiting for the arrival of Boy Dol as he have called me before coming. After Boy Dol arrived I asked my wife to leave the room and wait in the hall. When Boy Dol came to my room he was carrying the same green bag which was shown to me. He had the bag over his shoulders and I also saw him carrying a chrome helmet. After the arrival of Boy Dol in about 20 minutes Bob arrived and he brought with him a fruit carton into my room. Bob had brought inside the fruit carton about 25 packets of heroin. Each packet of heroin weighs about 1 pound or about 450 grams. I know about the weight because I had a digital weighing scale in my room all the time. 
 
14 I received all the 25 packets from Bob for $2,400 per packet and I paid the cash amount of about $60,000 for all the 25 packets of heroin. Out of the 25 packets of heroin I gave 10 packets of heroin to Boy Dol which I sold at $3,500 per packet. I saw Boy Dol taking the ten packets of heroin from the fruit carton and placing it into the green bag. When Boy Dol gave the money for the ten packets of heroin I saw him take the money from the side pocket of the green bag. I saw him counting the money in front of me when he paid me. After that I notice that he had a balance of about $1,000 or more and placing this money in the green bag. I also saw Boy Dol take the ten packets of heroin straight from the carton and placing them one by one inside the green bag. All the packets of heroin came in a plastic packet wrapping. 
 
15 At the time when I was in the room with Boy Dol and Bob my friend Saddam Hussain who is staying in the next room also came over and I sold him two packets of heroin from the same consignment. I sold the two packets of heroin for $3,500 each packet. Saddam Hussain paid me only $5,000 and he owed the balance of $2,000 to me. After the transaction with Saddam Hussain he left the room. Left in the room were Boy Dol, Bob and myself only. The three of us then smoked some heroin in the room using Chasing the Dragon method. We took some heroin from the packets of heroin which Bob brought in the fruit carton to smoke. After this Boy Dol left with the green bag filled with ten packets of heroin which he had taken from the fruit carton. Boy Dol is aware that I am getting the heroin from Bob but he cannot negotiate directly with Bob as I am the one who would deal with Bob. 
 
16 When Boy Dol was leaving my room the ten packets of heroin I warned him not to place the heroin in my flat at Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 [num ]12-1131. I advised him to place it in Surrey Mansion which is near Newton. I know that Boy Dol has an apartment at Surrey Mansion. When I told Boy Dol not to put the heroin packets which he had carried in the green bag in my flat at Blk 420 Ang Mo Kio he agreed. 
 
17 Bob left my room subsequently after taking all the money and I later cleared the fruit carton and there were about 13 packets of heroin left in my room. I hid the 13 packets of heroin under the cupboard of my room. The heroin packets were placed under the drawers of the cupboard and were actually hidden. It can only be seen if we remove the drawers. My wife Lisfah is not aware of the heroin which I had kept under the drawers and she is not aware of my drug trafficking activities. ...
  
 
 
 
 
 Boksenang`s defence 
 
 
 
 
 
Boksenang admitted that he had been avoiding arrest by the CNB since 20 March 1999 but he denied that the packets of drugs found in the haversack in the Ang Mo Kio flat belonged to him. He identified the haversack as belonging to Sharom and maintained that he never borrowed or took custody of the bag from Sharom at any time. He claimed that he was not at the Ang Mo Kio flat during the period of 14 to 19 March 1999 and he did not meet Sharom on 14 March (Sunday), much less borrow the latter`s haversack on that day. Like Sharom, Boksenang also sought to distance himself from the Ang Mo Kio flat. He claimed that he rented and stayed at a room in the Jelapang flat with his wife, Lisfah. Whilst he also rented the Ang Mo Kio flat from the HDB and had furnished it substantially after receiving the keys on 1 February 1999, he did not move into the flat as he had resumed his heroin addiction and was afraid that the CNB would trace him to his rented flat. Instead, he allowed Sharom to stay in the Ang Mo Kio flat since February 1999 as the latter had requested for a place to stay with his girlfriend, Norsila. Sharom needed a place to stay as he believed his other accommodation at Blk 195 Kim Keat Avenue [num ]04-324 was suspected by the CNB as being the place where he was selling heroin. Thus, a set of keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat was given to Sharom by Boksenang. Boksenang claimed that he and his wife never stayed at the Ang Mo Kio flat except for once after he gave the keys to Sharom and it was Sharom who occupied the flat with Norsila until Sharom was arrested on 20 March 1999.
Boksenang admitted that he met Sharom on 19 March 1999 (Friday) when Sharom went to the Jelapang flat in the morning. He claimed that Sharom was carrying a haversack when he arrived at the flat. During that occasion, Bai also went to the Jelapang flat as Boksenang had arranged to meet him there. Bai had brought with him a fruit carton containing packets of heroin which he took into Boksenang`s room in the Jelapang flat. Soon after, Hussain came and joined Bai, Sharom and him in the room as well. All three of them bought heroin from Bai, although Boksenang claimed that he only bought one sachet of heroin that was meant for his own consumption. On the other hand, Sharom bought ten packets of heroin from Bai and Boksenang saw him place the ten packets in his haversack. Hussain bought two packets and returned to his own room after that. The remaining three of them stayed in Boksenang`s room and smoked heroin together. After a while, Sharom left the room to go to Hussain`s room and he stayed there until he left the flat in the afternoon. When Sharom was leaving the flat he took his haversack with him and Boksenang told him not to place the haversack at the Ang Mo Kio flat and Sharom agreed not to do so. In the course of his oral examination during the trial, Boksenang maintained his position that the incriminating evidence in P47 had been given involuntarily. He insisted that he did not buy 25 packets of heroin from Bai and neither did he sell any heroin to Sharom or Hussain.
As for the events on the morning of 20 March 1999, Boksenang denied that he had instructed Sharom to go to the Ang Mo Kio flat, as was alleged by Norsila in her evidence. He claimed that Sharom had merely told him that he was going to the Ang Mo Kio flat with Norsila. He chose not to join them and stayed at the Costa Sands chalets, fleeing with Lisfah when the CNB officers raided the place. He then stayed with Lisfah at the Jelapang flat before going into hiding from the CNB officers.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The trial judge did not believe Sharom`s assertion that he was at the Ang Mo Kio flat only on three occasions and that he did not stay there at all. The trial judge also did not accept Sharom`s claim that Boksenang had borrowed his haversack. He noted that there were many shortcomings and inconsistencies in Sharom`s claims that substantially weakened his defence. He found that there was uncontroverted evidence that the ten packets of drugs were in Sharom`s haversack, which was found in the Ang Mo Kio flat and he was in possession of the keys to the said flat. Further, it was found that Sharom had bought the ten packets of drugs from Boksenang at the Jelapang flat and the drugs were in his possession when they were recovered from his haversack in the Ang Mo Kio flat. The trial judge held that in any event, Sharom had not rebutted the presumption of possession arising under s 18(1)(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (`MDA`) by virtue of the fact that he was found in possession of the keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat. The trial judge also found that Sharom did not rebut the presumption under s 17 of the MDA that the drugs were in his possession for the purposes of trafficking.
Turning to Boksenang, the trial judge rejected his claim that he did not stay at the Ang Mo Kio flat as there was sufficient evidence to show otherwise. However, what the trial judge found to be most incriminating was the confession he made in P47. He rejected the allegations of involuntariness raised by Boksenang in relation to the recording of P47 and found that it contained the truth of the events. Based on Boksenang`s own admission, the trial judge found that he had bought 25 packets of heroin from Bai, of which he sold ten packets to Sharom.
After reviewing all the evidence adduced before him, although the trial judge was satisfied that there was evidence that Sharom was in possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking and there was also evidence that Boksenang had sold the drugs to Sharom, he was not convinced that all this led to an irresistible inference of a criminal conspiracy between them as was contemplated by the original joint charge. Consequently, the trial judge substituted the joint charge against the two appellants with two separate charges. He found the appellants to be guilty on the substituted charge they each faced and convicted them, imposing the mandatory death sentence.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sharom`s appeal
 
Several grounds of appeal were raised by counsel for Sharom and these can be generally summarised in the following manner: 
(i) That the trial judge erred in law in substituting fresh charges against both appellants when he found that the joint charge could not be made out; and in proceeding with the substituted charges against both appellants in the same trial when the trial should have been severed. 
(ii) That the trial judge erred in failing to give any or sufficient weight to the evidence of Sharom and in wrongly assessing the evidence given by Norsila. 
(iii) That the trial judge erred in using the presumptions under s 17 and s 18(1)(c) of the MDA together to find a case against Sharom. 
(iv) That the trial judge erred in law in not directing himself to treat Boksenang`s evidence with caution under s 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
(i) Substitution of fresh charges and continuance of joint trial after severance of joint charge
Section 163(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) provides that `any court may alter any charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to an existing charge at any time before judgment is given`. Whilst it is true that in the present case the substitution of the fresh charges were made at a rather late stage in the trial, after the defence had already presented its case and both sides had delivered their closing submissions, we would point out that the power conferred by s 163(1), CPC, exists at every stage of the trial, so long as judgment has not been given yet. Hence, the trial judge was clearly empowered to substitute the original joint charge with new separate charges if he was of the view that the evidence did not support the original charge but may found others. The trial judge`s decision to substitute fresh charges against the two appellants was therefore not wrong in law.
Counsel for Sharom then sought to contend that the learned judge should have severed the hearing of the trial after substituting the two separate charges instead of continuing with the joint trial and the failure to do so thereby prejudiced Sharom. Under s 176 of the CPC, it is contemplated that two or more accused persons may be tried jointly for charges of different offences that were committed in the same transaction. The term `same transaction` was interpreted in 
Tse Po Chung Nathan v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 961
 , which decision was later followed and applied in 
Lee Teck Wah & Anor v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 827
 . It was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the earlier case that, the phrase `same transaction` meant that there was proximity of time, continuity of action, unity of place and unity of purpose or design in the commission of the different offences. The last element of `unity of purpose or design` has been regarded as the most important, whilst the remaining elements are not so crucial in establishing whether the offences were committed in the `same transaction`.
Here, the prosecution`s case was that, on 19 March 1999, Boksenang bought 25 packets of heroin from `Bai`, whereupon he immediately sold ten packets to Sharom. It was through this sale that Sharom was put in possession of the ten packets of heroin which he kept in his haversack and placed in the Ang Mo Kio flat. Considering the factual scenario put forward by the prosecution, it is clear that the two separate offences, Boksenang selling the drugs to Sharom and the latter being put in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking, were committed in the same transaction. In any case, we failed to see how the joint trial of the two substituted charges caused any prejudice to Sharom at all. It was clear that the substitution of the original charge was made by the trial judge after he assessed the existing evidence that had been presented by both sides and was not based on the introduction of any new facts or evidence. Furthermore, the trial judge had clearly taken the necessary precautionary safeguards when he made the substitution. He ensured that the new charges were read and explained to the two appellants and that they were given a fresh opportunity to tender a plea on the amended charges. All the parties were given the opportunity to recall any witnesses for further examination and call new witnesses as well as to make submissions on the new charges. It was pertinent to note that the trial judge also took care to ensure that defence counsel were not taken by surprise and were prepared to submit on the new charges when he offered to grant them more time to prepare any further submissions which they might wish to make. Indeed, the trial judge even went as far as to inquire if any party wished to make a plea on whether there was any difficulty with the substituted charges on a legal basis. No objections were raised at all. It was relevant to note that Mr SS Dhillon, who was also counsel for Sharom in the trial below, did not challenge the legality or propriety of the substitution of the charges and also declined the trial judge`s offer for more time as he was of the view that his earlier submissions already addressed the substituted charges adequately. In all the circumstances, we were of the view that this ground of appeal was unsustainable and must be rejected.
(ii) Evaluation of Sharom`s and Norsila`s evidence
Next, it was contended by counsel for Sharom that the trial judge had wrongly evaluated the evidence given by Sharom and Norsila. First, it was argued that the trial judge had overlooked the fact that the Ang Mo Kio flat was rented by Boksenang from HDB and Sharom was not the owner of the flat but had merely borrowed the keys from Boksenang and this fact was corroborated by Norsila`s evidence. It was contended that since Sharom was not the owner of the flat, the drugs found therein could not be considered to be in his possession.
In our opinion, the above argument was misconceived. To prove possession of drugs found in a flat, it is certainly not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the person in possession of the drugs is also the owner of the flat, and conversely, proof that a person is not the owner of the unit in which the drugs were found does not necessarily mean that the person could not have been in possession of the drugs. In any event, even if the prosecution was relying on the presumption of possession raised by s 18(1)(c) of the MDA, which we will discuss later, the argument by counsel for Sharom was still without merit. The presumption under s 18(1)(c) is not dependent upon ownership of the premises in which the drug was found, but will be raised once the accused is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control the keys of the place or premises in which the drug was found. In the present case, the presumption could be raised since the keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat were found in Sharom`s possession during a body search conducted immediately after he was arrested and Sharom himself had admitted that the keys belonged to him when he was questioned about it.
It was not disputed that Sharom was not the owner of the Ang Mo Kio flat. However, this did not preclude him from having used the place. From the evidence, it would seem to us that Sharom was indeed at the premises frequently, at least during the week prior to his arrest. Although he may not necessarily have stayed at the Ang Mo Kio flat for the length of period as alleged by Boksenang, Sharom was certainly not the mere occasional invitee at the flat that he sought to make himself out to be. His assertion that he did not stay in the flat but only visited it on the three occasions when he was invited by Boksenang was clearly not made out on the facts. Sharom had attempted to minimise his association with the Ang Mo Kio flat by saying in his oral testimony that he only stayed in the flat for one night and that was on 18 March 1999 (Thursday). This assertion was, however, completely contradictory to the long statement he made earlier on 5 April 1999 at 3.10pm (`D4`), where he stated that he had stayed at the Ang Mo Kio flat from 15 March (Monday) until the morning of 19 March (Friday). His explanation for the apparent discrepancy was that his earlier statement was a mistake as he was confused during the recording of the long statement. In this regard, we were in agreement with the trial judge`s view that this was an incredible explanation and that while it may be believable that a person who has only spent a night at a place may not recall the exact date of the stay, it was implausible that he would be mistaken as to how many days he stayed, especially by a difference of three days. We found the oral assertion to be untrue and merely a weak attempt by Sharom to bolster his defence. Furthermore, the fact that Sharom`s personal belongings like his clothing, his motorcycle cover, his drug trafficking paraphernalia such as the weighing scale and empty plastic sachets, were all found in the Ang Mo Kio flat was a strong indication that he was at the premises more often than the three occasions that he claimed. His own admission that the keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat were his when these were found on him was also contrary to the kind of reply that one would expect from someone who was borrowing the keys for the very first time.
The next argument advanced by counsel for Sharom was that the trial judge erred in disbelieving his defence that the drugs in the haversack belonged to Boksenang. Sharom claimed that the haversack was borrowed by Boksenang on 14 March 1999 (Sunday) and he did not see the haversack again until after his arrest. It was contended that this claim was corroborated by Norsila`s oral testimony in the trial. First, we noted that this crucial fact about Boksenang borrowing the haversack from him was never alluded to by Sharom in his cautioned statement, even though he had remembered to claim that the drugs in the haversack must have belonged to Boksenang. Instead, he stated in the cautioned statement that he had placed the haversack in the Ang Mo Kio flat on the Friday before his arrest (ie 19 March 1999). This appeared to run counter to his defence that he did not see or handle the haversack after he lent it to Boksenang on 14 March (Sunday). Although Sharom tried to insist during his cross- examination that he had said `Sunday` and not `Friday`, this was refuted by the interpreter involved in the recording of the statement, who testified that Sharom had specifically used the word `Friday` and the statement had been verified by him before he signed it. We found no reason to disagree with the trial judge`s decision to accept the interpreter`s testimony.
Secondly, we found it hard to believe why Boksenang would need to borrow the haversack from Sharom and why he would lend it to the former. According to Sharom, this was a haversack he had used since 1996 and he often used it to carry his own belongings as well as Norsila`s. He also claimed that he had never lent this haversack to anyone before this occasion. Yet, Sharom sought to maintain that he simply allowed Boksenang to borrow it without even asking why he needed it and when it would be returned. Furthermore, as was pointed out by the trial judge, the haversack in question was only an ordinary haversack which could easily be purchased and was not expensive. There was no credible reason why Boksenang should need to borrow a bag that was so personal to Sharom to contain packets of drugs which could easily have been kept or carried by other means.
As regards to the corroboration supposedly provided by Norsila`s evidence, we agreed with the trial judge`s doubts over the veracity of her evidence on this aspect due to the evident contradiction in her testimony. In the earlier statement Norsila made to the CNB officers, she had stated that on 14 March 1999 (Sunday), when they were at the Ang Mo Kio flat, Sharom told her to remove her belongings from his haversack without telling her the reason for doing so and she did not bother to ask him why. She further noted that the haversack was left behind in the flat when they left on that day. No mention was made in her statement that Boksenang had borrowed the haversack. Subsequently, during her cross-examination, Norsila then said that Sharom had told her that the haversack was left at the Ang Mo Kio flat because Boksenang wanted to borrow it. This was obviously inconsistent with her earlier statement. Curiously, when Norsila was referred to her earlier statement during the later course of her cross-examination, she again contradicted herself by affirming the earlier investigation statement and said that she did not know why she was asked to remove her belongings from the haversack and why it was left in the Ang Mo Kio flat. The confusion was obviously due to Norsila`s futile attempts to tailor her evidence in order to support that given by Sharom, who was her boyfriend.
After assessing the factual circumstances and the evidence presented before the court, we were of the view that the weight of the evidence was clearly against Sharom. He was in possession of the keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat, his personal belongings were found there and even his own statements showed that he was staying at the flat, at least in the week before his arrest. Sharom was also unable to prove that his haversack had been borrowed by Boksenang to contain the drugs. Another pertinent point was that we found Sharom`s behaviour during and after his arrest to be highly reflective of his guilt. When he was first arrested, he was distraught and nervous and he told a series of lies on where he had come from, which unit the seized keys belonged to and even his own identity. Counsel for Sharom argued that the lies told by him should not be treated as evidence of his guilt and the trial judge wrongly applied the law in doing so. In 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , the Court of Appeal followed the holding in the English case of 
R v Lucas (Ruth)
 
[1981] QB 720
 that, although the mere fact that an accused told lies should not amount to evidence of his guilt, there were certain circumstances in which lies by an accused could have corroborative value because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. The four criteria that must be satisfied before a lie can amount to corroboration was laid down by Lord Lane CJ in the English case at p 724 as follows: 
 
The lie ... must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. ... Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by [independent] evidence.
 
 
 
There was no doubt in our minds that the above four criteria had been satisfied and the lies told by Sharom were plainly deliberate attempts on his part to distance himself from the Ang Mo Kio flat and the drugs which he knew were placed in it. Sharom`s reaction when the haversack and its contents were found and placed before him in the Ang Mo Kio flat was another significant fact. The CNB officers testified that his response upon seeing the discovery of the haversack was to kneel down with his head touching the ground. In the words of Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen, who was in charge of the search of the Ang Mo Kio flat, he saw that Sharom`s face `looked contorted and he appeared like he was almost crying`. Such a reaction seemed to us to be inconsistent with someone who did not own the drugs and who did not know how and why the drugs got there.
At this juncture, we would add that the possession of drug trafficking paraphernalia, whose utility is obviously for the preparation of drugs for sale, is also relevant as circumstantial evidence of drug trafficking activities by an accused: see 
Chan Hock Wai v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 728
 , recently applied in 
Su Chee Kiong v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 782
 . In the present case, the drug trafficking paraphernalia such as the TANITA digital weighing scale and empty plastic sachets found in the Ang Mo Kio flat were admitted by Sharom to belong to him. This important circumstantial evidence supported the others to show that Sharom was in possession of the packets of drugs in the haversack for the purposes of trafficking them.
(iii) Use of the presumptions in s 17 and s 18(1)(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act
Section 17 of the MDA provides that `any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than ... (c) 2g of diamorphine ... shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking` unless it is proved otherwise. Section 18(1)(c) provides for the rebuttable presumption of possession of drugs which arises from proof of possession of the keys to any place in which a controlled drug is found. These two presumptions cannot, however, be used at the same time as the presumption in s 17 can apply only if the possession of the controlled drug is proved and not merely presumed, as would be the case if s 18(1)(c) was invoked: see 
Low Kok Wai v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 676
 ; 
Abdul Aziz bin Ahtam v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 96
 ; 
Aziz bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 175
  and 
Chia Song Heng v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 705
 . Consequently, if in the instant case, the prosecution sought to invoke the presumption in s 17 to prove the mens rea of possession for the purpose of trafficking, they would then be prevented from relying on the presumption of possession found in s 18(1)(c). This reasoning applies as well to the other presumptions of possession found in ss 18 to 21 of the MDA. Such being the case, we accepted the contention that the trial judge`s statement in his grounds of decision, that Sharom had failed to rebut both the presumptions in s 17 and s 18(1)(c) of the MDA, was highly misleading and erroneous.
However, this did not mean that the conviction of Sharom was wrongly founded. The prosecution did not need to rely on double presumptions to establish its case against Sharom since his possession of the drugs was clearly proven beyond a reasonable doubt on the facts. As discussed earlier, his close connection with the Ang Mo Kio flat, his failure to prove that his haversack was borrowed by Boksenang and other circumstantial evidence such as the lies he told and his guilty behaviour during the discovery of the haversack in the Ang Mo Kio flat all went towards proving that Sharom was in possession of the drugs in the haversack. There was thus no need for the prosecution to utilise the presumption of possession found in s 18(1)(c) and only s 17 was required to be relied upon. On the facts, we were not satisfied that the presumption in s 17 had been rebutted by Sharom. The drugs that were recovered from the haversack had a gross weight of more than 4.6kg, with a total drug content of not less than 60.17g of diamorphine. The large amount of drugs, beyond what was reasonably required for personal consumption, coupled with the existence of drug trafficking paraphernalia in the same premises, raised the irresistible inference that those drugs were in Sharom`s possession for the purposes of trafficking. In the result, we were of the view that this ground of appeal should be rejected as well.
(iv) Evidence of an accomplice or a person with an interest to serve
Another ground of appeal advanced by counsel for Sharom was that the trial judge erred in failing to treat Boksenang`s evidence against Sharom with caution as provided by s 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (`EA`)(Cap 97). The provision states as follows: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.
  
 
 
The law on the treatment of evidence given by an accomplice is well-settled and has been extensively examined by our local courts: see 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 , 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
  and 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
 . The common law rule that a court must warn itself of the danger of convicting on uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice has since been abrogated by s 135 of the EA which reads: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warm itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
As s 116, illustration (b), of the EA is couched in directory and not mandatory terms, the effect of reading this section together with s 135 is that the court may convict an accused person based on accomplice evidence that is uncorroborated, at the same time bearing in mind that the evidence should still be treated with caution as the accomplice may, and not must, be presumed to be unworthy of credit. In 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
  at 719, it was held, with regard to evidence of accomplices, that: 
 
All that the court is required to do is scrutinise such evidence carefully. However, accomplice evidence should be given the same weight as any other evidence so long as it is shown that the evidence is reliable from all the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
The above principles would similarly apply to a witness who is not an accomplice but one who has an interest to serve. In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 , the High Court recognised that the person with an interest to serve was in many ways akin to an accomplice and the court drew guidance from the law on accomplice evidence as to how it should treat the evidence of such persons. It was held at p 518 that: 
 
In light of the removal of the corroboration warning for accomplice evidence, it is not necessary either for the judge to administer himself a similar warning as regards the evidence of a person with an interest to serve, in contrast to the present position as to the evidence of victims of sexual offences and children.
 
 
 
It is open for the judge to so treat the evidence of an interested person with caution, but this is not a general rule. Whether caution is in fact required is very much dependent on the facts of the case.
 
 
 
On a legal basis, there was simply no merit in the argument that the trial judge must direct himself to treat Boksenang`s evidence with caution since there was no longer such a requirement under our law. On a factual basis, the argument must also fail since a careful examination of the trial judge`s reasons for convicting Sharom would reveal that he did not rely on the evidence of Boksenang to establish Sharom`s guilt. Rather, Sharom`s conviction was founded on other independent evidence and the numerous discrepancies and shortcomings in his own evidence which eventually rendered his defence incredible and unbelievable.
 Boksenang`s appeal 
 
 
 
Only one ground of appeal was raised by counsel for Boksenang and it was contended that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the long statement made by Boksenang on 11 August 1999 (P47) was a voluntary statement and was admissible as evidence. In challenging the admissibility of P47, it was alleged that the statement was procured as a result of inducement, threat and promise being made to Boksenang.
First, it was alleged that prior to the recording of P47, the IO Insp Muru had said this to him, `You better make your statement properly so that I will have an easy job. If not, I will arrest your wife because she is the second owner. This is the law`. This was apparently made in the presence of the interpreter, Sofia bte Sufri, who then confirmed that Insp Muru was correct to say that the second owner of the flat could be involved under the law. Boksenang claimed that he was very worried after hearing the threat as his wife had just given birth to twins three weeks ago and he was concerned about the care of his children should his wife be arrested as well. He therefore decided to follow what Insp Muru told him to do. Next, Boksenang alleged that during the recording Insp Muru referred to the statements made by Sharom, thereby inducing him to give a statement that was consistent with Sharom`s statements. Insp Muru further induced him by saying, `Do co-operate ... I can empathise with you. I would let you see your wife. This is special for you as long as you co-operate`. Boksenang also claimed that Insp Muru promised to make an application to the Deputy Public Prosecutor to get his capital charge reduced. During his cross-examination in the voir dire, Boksenang made a further allegation that Insp Muru had also threatened to detain him indeterminately when he had tried to tell Insp Muru that certain parts of Sharom`s statements were untrue.
All the allegations were denied by Insp Muru. Although he admitted that Boksenang may have said that the wife did not know anything about the heroin, Insp Muru denied that this was made as a result of any threats to arrest the wife. Insp Muru also agreed that after the recording of P47, Boksenang was in fact allowed visits by his wife on 16 and 17 August 1999, but he denied that this was pursuant to any promise he made to Boksenang. The interpreter, Sofia bte Sufri, gave a consistent testimony to that of Insp Muru. She affirmed that no inducement, threat or promise was made at all to Boksenang prior to and during the recording of P47. With regard to the allegation on the reduction of the charge, the interpreter gave evidence that it was Boksenang himself who had requested for Insp Muru to guarantee that the capital charge would be reduced to a non-capital one but Insp Muru had merely replied that Boksenang should bring up this matter with his defence counsel and no promises were made at all.
In the present case, as P47 was not made to police officers but to CNB officers, the admissibility of the statement would be governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`) and not the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). There are two stages in the test to determine whether a statement is admissible under s 24 of the EA. Firstly, was the confession made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise and secondly, whether in making that confession, the accused did so in circumstances which would have led him to reasonably suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself: see 
Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin & Anor v PP

 , 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 , 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 . The question of whether a statement is voluntary is essentially a question of fact and the test of voluntariness is both objective and subjective. The query of whether there is an inducement, threat or promise is objectively determined while the question of whether such inducement, threat or promise has operated on the mind of the accused must be subjectively answered from the perspective of the particular accused: see 
Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin & Anor v PP

[1995] 3 MLJ 350
 .
We now move on to consider firstly, whether objectively speaking, those remarks, allegedly made by Insp Muru, would have amounted to an inducement, threat or promise that would render the statement involuntary. The remark on arresting Boksenang`s wife, if made at all, could amount to a threat sufficient to vitiate the confession. This was so held in 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 , which was subsequently followed in 
Yeo See How v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 390
 , although in the latter case it was found for a fact that no such remark was made. As for the inducement to see the wife, this by itself was unlikely to be a sufficient inducement that would render the statement involuntary, especially if the accused was facing a capital charge. In 
 Yeo See How v PP 
 (supra), the court found that given the nature of the capital charge that the accused was facing, it was incredible that he would have made the statement merely to obtain cigarettes and visits by his family members. The court went on to say that the fact that the requests were later acceded to after the recording of the statement were also not conclusive since they were not made pursuant to any inducement or promise given earlier. This was similarly the case in the present situation. We could not believe and it made no sense that Boksenang`s free will would be so easily weakened by his desire to see his wife that he would rather give a statement that would eventually bring him more harm than any advantage.
The promise to procure a reduced charge would also amount to an obvious inducement to give a good statement in exchange for a non-capital charge. In 
 Poh Kay Keong v PP 
 (supra), the court was of the view that if such a promise had indeed been made, it would have been clear enough to vitiate the confession. The same would apply for a threat of indefinite detention, which could certainly induce an accused to confess in order to avoid the punishment of prolonged confinement. On the other hand, we did not think that the same could be said of a mere reference to statements made by a co-accused, an accomplice or even a witness. It was argued by counsel for Boksenang that Insp Muru`s reference to Sharom`s statements during the recording of P47 induced Boksenang to make the statement when he would not have done so otherwise. We were unable to agree with this contention. It was difficult to see how an accused person could perceive gaining any advantage or avoiding any evil by making a self-incriminating statement simply because he was told what his co-accused had said. On the contrary, it would seem proper that the accused should be kept informed of what kind of allegations have been made against him by other accused persons or witnesses so that he may properly defend himself against such allegations. Indeed, references to such other statements would assist the accused in deciding on what he should say to best present his defence and therefore should not be regarded as an inducement rendering the statement involuntary.
The next question that followed was the finding of whether those threats or inducements were actually made by Insp Muru before and in the course of the recording of P47. Counsel sought to argue that Boksenang`s utterance that his wife did not know anything about the heroin must have been made as a result of the threat to arrest his wife since this utterance was not recorded in P47. We found this to be an unconvincing argument. An indirect reference to the remark could in fact be found in paragraph 17 of P47 where Boksenang had said that his wife was not aware of his drug trafficking activities at all. There was also a very plausible alternative explanation for this remark on the non-involvement of his wife. Boksenang had mentioned in his statement that his wife was present at the Jelapang flat on 19 March 1999 when the drug trafficking transaction took place and therefore, it was necessary for him to clarify that she was not a party to the drug trafficking activities and should not be implicated. There was insufficient evidence to show that the utterance by Boksenang must have been made pursuant to a threat to arrest his wife.
After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge reached the finding that the alleged statements were never made by Insp Muru to procure the making of P47. He observed that Boksenang was not entirely consistent in his complaints and in the course of the voir dire, he even sought to embellish his allegations, adding that Insp Muru had also threatened him with indefinite detention if he failed to co-operate, even though this serious allegation was never mentioned before and neither was it put to Insp Muru or the interpreter. In the course of his oral testimony in the voir dire, Boksenang also gave somewhat contradictory accounts of how the recording of P47 took place. At first, he claimed that Insp Muru did not tell him what to say and would ask questions which he would then answer. However, he later said that Insp Muru had taught him the contents of nearly the whole statement and that Insp Muru was the one who provided the answers to the questions, which formed the details in the statement. In addition, although Boksenang alleged that he was compelled by Insp Muru to make a statement that was consistent with those made by Sharom, a careful perusal of P47 showed that it was not actually consistent since Sharom`s account of the events that took place on 19 March 1999 (Friday) at the Jelapang flat had significant differences from Boksenang`s version. This did not gel with Boksenang`s claim that he made P47 to satisfy the demands for consistency with and corroboration of Sharom`s statements. Furthermore, Sharom`s statements were all recorded before Boksenang`s first statement was even taken, therefore if Insp Muru had wanted consistency with Sharom`s statements, he could have demanded for it in Boksenang`s earlier statements and not wait until his third long statement. In any case, we noticed that his earlier statements were not contradictory to the events as recorded in P47 as all the statements each dealt with distinct events. Hence, there appeared to be little reason for Insp Muru to be displeased with Boksenang`s earlier statements, as was suggested, such that he had to resort to the use of inducement, threat or promise to procure P47 when none had been necessary in the recording of the earlier statements.
In summary, we found that Boksenang`s allegations were self-contradictory and inherently improbable on the facts of the case. The evidence he gave to support his claims were inconsistent and the assertions were not otherwise sustained by objective evidence. On the other hand, Insp Muru`s evidence was clearly substantiated by the testimony of the interpreter, refuting the bare allegations raised by Boksenang. As the trial judge had the benefit of hearing and seeing the witnesses give evidence and was in the position to test their credibility and veracity in the witness box, the appellate court should be slow to disturb the findings that were reached by him. We saw no reason to depart from the findings made by the learned judge and affirmed his decision that the statement in P47 was made voluntarily and was admissible as evidence.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the light of the foregoing reasons, we found the separate charges against the two appellants established beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore upheld the convictions and mandatory death sentences passed by the trial judge and dismissed both the appeals.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): Loganatha Venkatesan (`Venkatesan`) and Chandran s/o Rajagopal (`Chandran`) were charged for the murder of one Madavamani s/o Thuraisamy Thangavelu @ T Maniam (`Maniam`), a retired police inspector from the Criminal Investigation Department. Maniam was battered to death near his residence on 21 April 1999 at about 7am. Maniam`s widow, Julaiha Begum (`Julaiha`), was charged for abetting Venkatesan and Chandran in the commission of the offence by conspiring with them to murder her husband. All three of them were tried together and were convicted and sentenced to death. They appealed against their respective convictions. We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.
 Background 
 
 
 
Julaiha`s first husband was one Abdul Kareem s/o Mohamed Shariff, and they have four children from that marriage: two sons and two daughters. They were divorced in 1981, and Julaiha had custody of the daughters, Sairah and Fairos, and the second son, while Abdul Kareem had custody of the elder son. At that time, Julaiha was living in a flat at Dover Crescent. Maniam came to know Julaiha at about this time and became very close to her. He subsequently moved in to live with her. Sairah and Fairos were then about five and eleven years old respectively. Maniam was himself married at that time. He later divorced his wife and married Julaiha in 1991. In the meantime, Julaiha sold her flat at Dover Crescent and moved into a terrace house at Jurong Kechil, which Maniam had purchased in his sole name. In 1993, Maniam sold that house and purchased 86 Phoenix Garden with Julaiha as the joint owner. In the same year, he retired from the police force and started his own security business. While Sairah and Fairos got along very well with Maniam, the relationship between the three of them and Julaiha was very strained. Their relationship began to deteriorate sometime in the mid-1990s and there were frequent domestic fights and quarrels in the household.
It was in those unsettled times in 1996 that Julaiha first came to know Venkatesan. Venkatesan lived a few houses away from 86 Phoenix Garden together with other Indian workers and he befriended Julaiha sometime in 1996. There was grave suspicion entertained by Maniam and his step-daughters that the two of them had an affair. Fairos claimed that she saw them behaving rather intimately towards each other. This was vehemently denied by both Venkatesan and Julaiha. On 28 October 1996, Maniam and the two sisters saw Julaiha and Venkatesan walking hand-in-hand in Teck Whye. This encounter ended with a scuffle between the two men. Venkatesan and Julaiha denied that they were holding hands and said that she met him at Teck Whye to collect some food which he had brought for her. The very next morning, Julaiha went to 86 Phoenix Garden to gather her belongings to move out of the house permanently. She was accompanied by her friend Sellamal, Sellamal`s daughter, and son-in-law, Moghan Perisamy (`Moghan`). Maniam refused to let Moghan into the house and a quarrel ensued between them. The police arrived and Moghan and Sellamal were advised to stay outside, while Julaiha was escorted into the house to collect her belongings. According to Sairah and Fairos, Julaiha threatened Maniam that she would `take care` of him before she left the house. After leaving the matrimonial home, Julaiha first stayed with Sellamal; so did Venkatesan. But eventually they rented two separate rooms in a flat at Block 325, Tah Ching Road. Their landlady was one Juliyah bte Ramlee (`Juliyah`).
Venkatesan took up a private summons against Maniam and the two sisters for the assault at Teck Whye and the case was heard in April 1998. Sairah and Fairos were acquitted, but Maniam was convicted and fined $500. Following that, Venkatesan commenced civil proceedings against Maniam claiming damages for the personal injuries he suffered from the incident. The matter remained pending at the time of Maniam`s death. Another outstanding matter was a private summons taken out by Venkatesan against Maniam arising from a later incident in which Venkatesan alleged that Maniam sent two men to beat him up. The summons was scheduled to be heard on 24 April 1999.
There was also a long-standing dispute between Maniam and Julaiha regarding the ownership of 86 Phoenix Garden. In March 1996, a negotiation for a settlement was conducted at the office of the lawyer, John Abraham, a friend of Maniam. Julaiha asked for 50% of the property but Maniam was only prepared to give her 40%. Julaiha rejected the offer. The matter was eventually taken to the High Court. On 18 November 1998, Tay Yong Kwang JC ordered the property to be sold no later than June 1999 and the proceeds of sale were to be apportioned between Maniam and Julaiha in the proportions of 80% to Maniam and 20% to Julaiha.
 The attack 
 
 
 
At about 7 am on 21 April 1999, Maniam left his house for work. As he walked towards his car which was parked outside the gates of a military compound diagonally opposite his house, he was viciously attacked by two men. At the end of the assault, Maniam collapsed outside the gates of his neighbour`s house at 71 Phoenix Garden, a short distance away from his car. He was pronounced dead at 7.25am.
Dr Teo Eng Swee, a pathologist with the Department of Scientific Services, testified that Maniam died from severe head injuries. In his opinion, there were at least four blows to the left side of the head, one to the right side, and one to the neck. The base of the skull was cracked from ear to ear. Part of Maniam`s right middle finger was amputated and this was described by Dr Teo as one of the various defensive injuries found on Maniam`s hands and arms. No other similar injuries were found on other parts of the body, thus suggesting that the assailants concentrated their attack mainly on the head. No murder weapon was recovered by the police.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution`s case was that Venkatesan and Chandran attacked and killed Maniam while an accomplice waited in a get-away truck, and that Julaiha had abetted them in the commission of that offence by conspiring with them. The evidence which implicated Julaiha, Venkatesan and Chandran in the conspiracy was given by one Govindasamy Ravichandran (`Ravichandran`).
 Conspiracy 
 
 
 
In so far as material, Ravichandran`s evidence was as follows. He knew Venkatesan and Chandran from his childhood days in an Indian village known as Pudukuppam. Ravichandran first came to know about their plan on 14 April 1999. Venkatesan and Chandran approached him and brought him to a quiet spot at a block of flats in Geylang Avenue East. Venkatesan said that he had a court case with Maniam and that he was unlikely to win, so they would have to `finish off that man [Maniam]`. This was understood by Ravichandran to mean that they were to kill Maniam. Chandran provided details of a previous attempt to kill Maniam. He told Ravichandran that Julaiha had earlier paid some men to kill Maniam, but the men ran away with the money without completing the task.
After that, Venkatesan and Chandran brought Ravichandran to meet Julaiha at the void deck near her rented premises at Block 325 Tah Ching Road. During this meeting, Julaiha told him to `finish that man [Maniam]`. Ravichandran expressed his reservations about carrying out the plan, since he was married with a one year old daughter. Julaiha assured him that she would pay him any amount he wanted and that once he `had finished off` the man, she would get the house and could sell it. She also said that since Venkatesan would be recognised in that area, as he used to live there, Ravichandran and Chandran were to attack Maniam instead. Ravichandran eventually acceded to her request after her repeated pleadings. The meeting ended at about 2.30am on 15 April.
In the evening of the same day, Venkatesan, Chandran, Ravichandran and another man referred to by Venkatesan as `Mani` met for drinks and thereafter they proceeded to 86 Phoenix Garden. There, Venkatesan pointed out to them the car which belonged to Maniam. He told them that Maniam would leave for work at about 6.30am and they could surprise him when he opened the boot of his car. He added that if Maniam did not die from a heart attack, they were to `beat him and finish him off`. According to Ravichandran, Venkatesan went to a field in Geylang East to pick up a broad bladed knife known in Tamil language as `aruval` and left it in the pick-up truck. Venkatesan told them that they were to carry out the plan the next morning on 16 April. After that, all of them rested in Chandran`s room at Changi Road.
The first attempt on Maniam`s life took place in the early hours of the morning on 16 April 1999. Four persons were involved: Venkatesan, Chandran, Ravichandran and Mani. After collecting a blue pick-up truck, all four of them arrived at Phoenix Garden and they stopped at some distance away from the house. There, Venkatesan told them to try and `finish off the man` and then left in a taxi. The other three remained in the truck and Mani drove to see if Maniam`s car was there and having done that he drove back to the original spot, and they waited. A short while later, Mani drove the truck nearer to Maniam`s house. Chandran told Ravichandran that he would go out and wait for Maniam, and that upon Chandran giving a signal indicating that Maniam was leaving the house, Ravichandran was to bring him an iron pipe. However, when Chandran eventually gave the signal, Ravichandran was too frightened to hand over the iron pipe. Instead he took the iron pipe and walked away from Maniam. In consequence, that attempt was aborted. After the first abortive attempt, Ravichandran began to have second thoughts about executing the plan and he decided to cheat them of their money instead, should they call upon him again.
On the following day, 18 April (which was a Sunday), Ravichandran met Venkatesan and Chandran on his way to his friend VJ Velu`s home. Venkatesan invited him to meet Julaiha at her flat. So he, Venkatesan, Chandran and also his brother, Rajesh went to her flat that afternoon. Juliyah and her husband were away at Batam at that time. They watched television and ate some snacks prepared by Julaiha. Venkatesan also showed Rajesh some of his paintings. The party ended at about 7pm. This visit was corroborated by Rajesh.
After that Ravichandran retired to his room. Later that evening, Venkatesan and Chandran visited Ravichandran. They later gathered at Chandran`s room. Venkatesan told Ravichandran that he had to `finish him [Maniam] off` and that he was to get some number plates for the pick-up truck. He also instructed him to run Maniam down with the vehicle and that if he survived the collision, they should alight and assault him. Venkatesan also told Mani that he should change the licence plate after running Maniam down. Venkatesan then left with Mani to get the number plates, while Ravichandran remained with Chandran in the latter`s room. At that time, Chandran`s room-mate, Tamilvanan was also in the room. When Venkatesan returned he brought the three of them, Chandran, Ravichandran and Mani, to Maniam`s house in a taxi to check if Maniam was at home. They saw Maniam`s car and concluded that he must be at home. It was then about 12.30am on Monday, 19 April. Venkatesan said that they should `finish him off today`. The four of them then returned to Chandran`s room to rest.
At about 4am they were awakened by Venkatesan and they started making preparations for the assault. On Venkatesan`s instructions, Chandran handed to Ravichandran $3,000 and told him that he would get more money from Julaiha after Maniam was killed. Again, the four of them, Venkatesan, Chandran, Mani and Ravichandran, travelled to Phoenix Garden in the pick-up truck and arrived there between 5.50am and 6am. At the vicinity near Maniam`s house, Vanketesan got off and left. Ravichandran decided to delay the act, and he therefore asked Chandran to get some beer from a coffeeshop nearby. They went to have some beer and by the time they returned, Maniam`s car was gone. Hence, this attempt was again unsuccessful.
After that, Ravichandran began to make plans to leave for India. He notified his employer of his impending departure and also made a request to the Ministry of Manpower for an expedited payment of his wages. Later in the evening while he was with his friends Saravanan Vasudevan (whom he called `Shanmugam`) and VJ Velu having a drink at a coffee shop at Joo Chiat, he confided in them that Venkatesan and Chandran had given him some money to kill a person. He said that Saravanan Vasudevan advised him not to get involved in the scheme. On 20 April, he gave one Segar, his wife`s relative who was working in Singapore, a sum of $3,400 for him to remit the money back to India on his behalf. When queried as to why he had so much money, he said that Venkatesan and Chandran paid him to kill someone.
At 12.30am on 20 April, Mani told Ravichandran that Venkatesan and Chandran were waiting for him in Chandran`s room. They proceeded there and they rested until about 4am when they were awakened by Venkatesan. When Chandran was in the toilet, Ravichandran seized the opportunity and stole $3,000 from his wallet. Venkatesan, Chandran and Ravichandran then took a taxi to Lorong 13, Geylang. Venkatesan told them that he would fetch Mani, while Ravichandran was dropped off near his room to get a change of clothes. He pretended to head towards his room, but he subsequently left for `Tekka` to take a meal. After bidding farewell to his employer, he bought himself an air ticket and left for Madras that day.
The prosecution adduced evidence to show that the sum of $6,000 in Chandran`s possession originated from Julaiha. One Peer Mohamed s/o Mohamad Hassan was introduced to Venkatesan sometime in February 1998. Venkatesan called on him whenever he needed to find work. Peer Mohamed first met Julaiha when she borrowed $2,500 from him in July 1998. In March 1999, Julaiha requested for a loan of $8,000 to $9,000, claiming that she needed the money to pay her lawyers. He decided to help her raise the money. He asked his friend, one John Tan Tai Poh, to lend Julaiha the sum of $7,500 but John Tan would only be prepared to make the loan if Peer Mohammed would accept the loan as being made to him. Peer Mohamed agreed and arranged for John Tan to meet Julaiha on 7 April 1999. Two cash cheques totalling the sum of $7,500 were given to Julaiha and it was not disputed that the entire sum was then given to Venkatesan, who in turn gave $6,000 to Chandran.
There was also adduced the evidence of Chandran`s room-mate Narayanasamy Tamilvanan (`Tamilvanan`). His evidence was that on the day before the murder, he overheard Chandran telling Venkatesan that Ravichandran had absconded to India after stealing the money. Chandran told Venkatesan that he did not have money for his expenses and Venkatesan replied `Madam [Juliaha] will not give any money now. After we have finished the job, you can ask her for money.`
 Killing 
 
 
 
It was the prosecution`s case that Venkatesan and Chandran attacked Maniam with weapons in the morning of 21 April 1999 while `Mani` waited for them in their get-away truck. Three prosecution witnesses gave their account of the fatal attack on Maniam. They were Fairos, Aurea David who was a maid working at 73 Phoenix Garden, and her employer Geraldine Tan Poh Choo.
Fairos testified that she woke up at about 7am on the fateful morning, when she heard some noises outside her bedroom window facing Geraldine Tan`s house across the road. She saw two Indians struggling with another man. That man was wearing a long sleeve shirt whom she subsequently identified as Maniam. One of the assailants was about one head taller than the other. Both of them were wearing T-shirts and Bermuda shorts. It then occurred to her that the victim might be her stepfather. Her suspicion was confirmed when she ran to her sister`s room, which had a view of where Maniam usually parked his car, and she discovered that Maniam`s car was still there. By the time she went back to her room, Maniam was already on the ground and the assailants were `kicking and stamping` him. She saw the shorter assailant raised his arm and brought it down very quickly, hitting Maniam`s head. The pick-up truck began reversing and both assailants approached the truck. Before reaching the pick-up truck, the taller assailant turned back and walked towards Maniam again. He kicked and stamped Maniam. After that, he walked back to the pick-up truck and jumped on board.
Even though she did not have a clear look at the faces of the assailants, she confirmed that Venkatesan as the taller assailant and identified Chandran as the other assailant during two separate identification parades held on 12 May 1999. At first, she could not recognise the assailants at all but when she saw the side profile of the taller man during the attack, she recognised him as Venkatesan because of his distinctive slouch. She made the same observation to the police when they first arrived at the scene. As for Chandran, she identified him during the identification parade after he was asked to turn around with his back facing her. She observed during the attack that the shorter assailant had a unique haircut which she said resembled a `mushroom head`. He was asked to turn around because she saw the assailants` back most of the time during the attack and was therefore more familiar with that view.
Aurea David testified that a blue pick-up truck was parked outside her employer`s house at about 5.40am when she was carrying out her household chores. At about 7am, she heard a commotion outside the house. From her bedroom window, she saw an Indian man hitting another Indian man with a pole. Immediately, she woke up Geraldine Tan and alerted her to the fight outside the house. Geraldine Tan looked out of her window and saw two Indian men running towards a blue pick-up truck which had since moved past her front gate and was heading towards the front gate of Maniam`s house. Both of them were carrying an object with them. She said the taller one was carrying something which looked like an axe and the other was carrying a pole. Like Fairos, she also testified that one assailant was a head taller than the other. The prison records also supported the identification evidence; it was there recorded that the height of Venkatesan was 1.795 m and that of Chandran was 1.61 m.
 Events after the killing 
 
 
 
It was also the evidence of Tamilvanan that sometime in the evening after the murder, Venkatesan looked for Chandran in his room and said to him, `Well, the problem was over`. Chandran then asked for money but Venkatesan said that Madam would give them the money in two days` time. The next evening, Venkatesan visited Chandran again and the latter asked for money once more. Venkatesan said that it would take another four to five days.
On 21 April, Juliyah told Julaiha that someone was killed at Phoenix Garden. After watching the news, Julaiha said that Maniam was the victim. According to Juliyah, she looked shocked but she did not appear upset or distressed. The next day, Julaiha told Juliyah that the police might be looking for her. She wanted Juliyah to tell the police that Venkatesan and herself (Julaiha) were having breakfast together on the morning of 21 April 1999. Juliyah was puzzled and said that there was no reason to lie if there was nothing to hide. However, Julaiha pleaded with her saying that Venkatesan was a good person and that if they helped him, one day he might help them in return. Juliyah relented and agreed. Julaiha thanked her profusely. She then left the house, saying that she wanted to go and see her lawyer to determine if she could get the house now that Maniam was dead.
 The defence 
 
 
 
Both Venkatesan and Chandran denied the existence of a conspiracy between themselves and Julaiha to kill Maniam. Venkatesan also denied that he had an affair with Julaiha. However, both Venkatesan and Chandran admitted that they were present at the scene on the morning of 21 April 1999 together with Mani, but they denied that they were there to carry out a murder plan. The thrust of their defence was that Chandran and Mani were asked by Venkatesan to negotiate a settlement with Maniam and it was for this reason that they approached Maniam on that morning. In addition, they claimed that Mani acted on his own accord and attacked Maniam with an instrument.
They gave evidence that Venkatesan`s father was very ill and Venkatesan badly needed some money to return to India to see him. Therefore, Venkatesan wanted to procure an out-of-court settlement with Maniam in respect of the civil claim for the assault at Teck Whye. As there was bad blood between the two men, Venkatesan had to rely on others to negotiate on his behalf. Eventually he enlisted the help of Ravichandran, Chandran and Mani. However, Ravichandran ran off with $6,000 which Venkatesan had given to Chandran. According to him, the sum was given to Chandran for safe-keeping and he intended to send the money back home in India. Eventually, Venkatesan asked Chandran and Mani to take over the conduct of the negotiations instead.
Their account of the events on 21 April was this. The trio arrived at Phoenix Garden in the pick-up truck. Mani drove the pick-up truck there but Venkatesan subsequently took over the driver`s seat. When Maniam was standing next to his car, Venkatesan drove the pick-up truck right up to the back of Maniam`s car. Chandran and Mani alighted from the pick-up truck. Chandran asked Maniam, `Sir, are you Maniam?` To which he replied, `Yes, so what?` Chandran went on to tell him that Venkatesan wanted some money to settle the claim as his father who was ill would like to see him in India. Maniam hurled verbal vulgarities at them. Chandran alleged that he said, `You 
 pundeh 
 from India. What do you think you are? I will pay you if you will get your mother and his mother to sleep with me!` After throwing a bunch of keys and newspapers at Chandran, Maniam ran. Chandran followed him but Mani pushed Maniam to the ground and hit him with something which looked like a piece of wood or pipe. All the while, Chandran pleaded with Mani to stop hitting Maniam. After Maniam collapsed on the ground, Chandran and Mani ran back to the pick-up truck and Venkatesan drove off.
Julaiha`s defence was one of denial of the conspiracy to kill Maniam. She denied that she met Ravichandran or his brother Rajesh; that she raised any money to pay Ravichandran, Mani and Chandran; and that she tried to set up a false alibi defence for Venkatesan. The crux of her defence was that Ravichandran was not a reliable witness and that his testimony of a conspiracy should not be believed.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The learned judge accepted the evidence of the three eye witnesses of the incident, namely, Fairos, Geraldine Tan Poh Choo and Aurea David. He found that they were forthright and truthful. He fully appreciated the discrepancies in their evidence in relation to what they each saw on that morning, but he did not consider that these discrepancies affect the prosecution`s case because the witnesses were `recalling different aspects of a quick and traumatic event` which they saw from different angles.
The learned judge accepted Ravichandran`s evidence in respect of Julaiha`s involvement and the previous attempts to kill Maniam which were undertaken by Chandran, Venkatesan, Mani and Ravichandran himself. He found Ravichandran to be a convincing witness because many aspects of his evidence were corroborated by independent witnesses.
He rejected Venkatesan`s and Chandran`s evidence that they were at Phoenix Garden on the morning of 21 April 1999 solely for the purpose of negotiating with Maniam for compensation. He found it unbelievable. In his view, it was also unbelievable that Mani would go berserk and attack Maniam on his own accord. Further, it was inexplicable why there was no prior discussion as to the minimum amount acceptable to Venkatesan. It was an added paradox that Venkatesan, who did not want to see Maniam to avoid any hostile reaction, would drive so close to Maniam`s car. The forensic evidence showed that the broken plastic pieces found near the back of Maniam`s car matched the broken plastic cover of the front right signal light of the pick-up truck, indicating that it hit the car in a front-to-rear collision. This was more consistent with the prosecution`s submission that Venkatesan drove his pick-up truck to collide into the car to prevent Maniam from escaping. He held that the cut-out photograph of Maniam and the registration numbers of Maniam`s car and motorcycle were given to Chandran to assist him in identifying Maniam. In his view, even the description of the encounter by Venkatesan and Chandran `vividly fits the picture of any ambush`. Accordingly, he held that both of them had gone to Phoenix Garden with the common intention of killing Maniam and that both of them inflicted injuries on Maniam.
With respect to Julaiha, the learned judge held that sometime in April 1999, she conspired with Venkatesan and Chandran to kill Maniam in order to get the house at Phoenix Garden. He accepted the evidence of Ravichandran that Julaiha gave him instructions to `finish off` Maniam during their first meeting in the early hours of 15 April 1999. He took into account the fact that she told Juliyah in the middle of March 1996 that the property was hers and that she wanted to get it back, sell it and return to India. This corroborated the evidence of Ravichandran that she had said the same thing to him. Her obsession for getting the house was also evident from her attempt to get the house through the courts and her statement to Juliyah on the day after Maniam died that she was going to consult her lawyer to see if the house belonged to her, now that Maniam was dead.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
In this case, the evidence of Ravichandran was most crucial. First, it established the conspiracy which took place between Julaiha, Venkatesan and Chandran to kill Maniam. Secondly, it debunked the defence of Venkatesan and Chandran that they intended to negotiate an amicable settlement with Maniam and that they went to Phoenix Garden to meet him for that purpose on 21 April 1999. Counsel for all the three appellants devoted substantial portions of their respective arguments towards challenging the reliability and veracity of Ravichandran`s evidence. We propose to deal with their arguments together.
First, it was argued on behalf of the appellants that Ravichandran was an accomplice and that the learned judge had failed to treat his evidence with caution. They relied on the illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). On the other hand, the prosecution argued that Ravichandran could not be regarded as an `accomplice`, because he did not participate in the commission of the crime with which the appellants were charged, and relied on the definition of an accomplice given by Lord Simonds in 
Davies v DPP
 
[1954] AC 378
 at p 400 as: 
 
persons who are 
 participes criminis
 in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing, procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanours).
 
 
 
It was further submitted that even if he had participated in the conspiracy to murder Maniam, his participation was limited to the planning stage and that he clearly did not follow through with the execution of the murder plan once he pulled out of the conspiracy.
In our judgment, it was not necessary to decide the issue of whether Ravichandran was an accomplice. All that the illustration to s 116 of the Evidence Act says is that an accomplice may be presumed to be unworthy of credit and that his evidence may be treated with caution: 
Chua Keem Leong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 . However, whether the presumption is applicable or not would depend on the circumstances of the case. It is open to the trial judge to accept an accomplice`s evidence, if he finds that it is reliable. Whether or not the court should believe the evidence of the accomplice would depend on all the circumstances of the case, and the evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as its inherent probabilities and improbabilities. Where, however, the court does not discern any attempt by the accomplice to minimise materially his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused and his evidence is found to be consistent as a whole and reliable on a review of the whole evidence, there is no reason why the evidence should be treated as unreliable: 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
  at pp 55-56.
The arguments advanced by counsel seeking to cast doubts on the reliability and veracity of Ravichandran`s evidence had been considered by the trial judge. It was pointed out that he entered Singapore in 1991 using a passport bearing the name Govind Ravi as opposed to his full name and that later when he entered Singapore in 1997, his full name was reflected in the passport. It was therefore suggested that Ravichandran had to use a different name in his passport to enter Singapore in 1997 in order to obtain a work permit because he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for overstaying in Singapore in 1991 under the name Govind Ravi. And Ravichandran did not give a coherent explanation for this. All he said was that his old passport was taken away at Madras airport and was never returned to him. Ravichandran had also lied to his friends when he told them that Venkatesan and Chandran paid him $6,000 to kill a man when he was only paid $3,000. Ravichandran was a thief; he stole $3,000 from Chandran. In summary, Ravichandran was a cheat, a thief and a liar, and his evidence ought not to have been accepted.
It was apparent that the learned judge had taken into account the flaws in Ravichandran`s character. Having done that, he considered Ravichandran`s evidence on the material aspects of the case reliable and he accepted such evidence. He said at [para ] 50 of his grounds of judgment: 
 
In this case, I find that Ravichandran spoke with the assuredness that comes only from a person who has been where he said he has been, and done what he said he has done. His tale was detailed and complete. Wherever corroboration was possible evidence was called. Thus, when he said that after the first aborted attempt he visited a doctor at Boon Lay but was not given a medical certificate, evidence was adduced from the doctor and his clinic staff to verify that part of his evidence. Even the manager of the cinema at Sultan Plaza testified that during the material time in mid-April 1999 his cinema was indeed screening the film, 
 Padaiappa
. When he referred to things said in the presence of Chandran`s room-mate Tamilvanan, Tamilvanan corroborated that evidence. His evidence of the visit to Julaiha`s rented abode on Sunday, 18 April, was supported by Rajesh. I have no difficulty finding Tamilvanan, notwithstanding his mild speech defect, and Rajesh, to be forthright and truthful witnesses.
 
 
 
On the evidence before the learned judge he was plainly entitled to make this finding on the veracity of Ravichandran`s evidence.
It was argued on behalf of the appellants that Ravichandran had incentives to give evidence implicating the appellants. True, it could be inferred that there was some personal incentives to Ravichandran for him to come forward and give evidence at the trial. True also that there were various aspects of his evidence which were not wholly satisfactory as pointed out by counsel for the appellants. Bearing these in mind, the question is whether the evidence he gave was nevertheless reliable and truthful. In this connection, it is important to note that several material aspects of his evidence on the conspiracy involving Julaiha, Venkatesan and Chandran either were not disputed or were corroborated. His evidence that he was enlisted by Venkatesan and Chandran to help in a matter concerning Maniam was not disputed. The dispute centred on the matter in question. Ravichandran`s evidence was that Venkatesan and Chandran persuaded him to help them kill Maniam, whereas both Venkatesan`s and Chandran`s evidence was that they enlisted Ravichandran`s help to negotiate a settlement with Maniam. Next, it was not disputed that Venkatesan handed a sum of $6,000 to Chandran, and the latter either in the presence or with the knowledge of Venkatesan paid $3,000 to Ravichandran for the part he was to play, and that further Ravichandran stole the other sum of $3,000 from Chandran. Nor was it disputed that the whole of the sum of $6,000 came from Julaiha. It was proved in evidence that Julaiha raised a loan of $7,500 from or through Peer Mohamed, and having received this sum handed it to Venkatesan. We noted also that Ravichandran informed his friend, Saravanan Vasudevan, that Venkatesan and Chandran enlisted his help to kill a person. That was corroborated by Saravanan Vasudevan himself. That, of course, was not evidence of the truth of that statement but was evidence that he did say such a thing.
Ravichandran`s evidence of the first meeting with Julaiha where he said that Julaiha asked him to `finish off` Maniam and that she would pay him money for so doing was not corroborated. But the fact remained that he did receive $3,000 from Chandran, and that, was part of funds borrowed by Julaiha from or through Peer Mohamed. His evidence that on 18 April 1999 he was brought along by Venkatesan to meet Julaiha at the flat where Venkatesan and Julaiha were living was corroborated by his brother Rajesh.
Quite apart from Ravichandran`s testimony, in our judgment, the circumstantial evidence was consistent with the existence of a conspiracy: First, Julaiha raised a loan of $7,500 from or through Peer Mohamed and handed the money to Venkatesan, and the latter paid $6,000 to Chandran who in turn paid $3,000 to Ravichandran. Second, Julaiha attempted to create a false alibi for Venkatesan by asking Juliyah to lie to the police officers.
On the evidence before the court, the learned judge`s finding of conspiracy was wholly supportable. The learned judge said at [para ] 58: 
 
The charge against Julaiha is that of the abetment of murder by conspiracy. By this charge it is not envisaged that she should have been present at the scene of the murder and participated in the slaughter of Maniam. If conspiracy is proved it would be as if her hand was there, adding weight to the force of every blow that fell him. The evidence that I have reviewed draws me to conclude that sometime in April 1999 Julaiha participated in a conspiracy with Venkatesan and Chandran to kill Maniam. The evidence suggests that there must have been other discussions each amounting to a criminal conspiracy sufficient to meet the charge, but the prosecution has sufficiently proved the conspiracy that took place at the void deck of Juliyah`s flat in the early hours of 15 April 1999 when Ravichandran was brought by Venkatesan and Chandran to meet Julaiha and receive her exhortation to finish Maniam.
 
 
 
 
 
 Eyewitnesses` testimonies 
 
 
 
 
 
The attack on Maniam was seen by Fairos, Geraldine Tan Poh Choo and Aurea. Fairos saw two Indian men using weapons and attacking a third Indian man, who she later found was her stepfather. Fairos later identified the assailants as Venkatesan and Chandran. Geraldine Tan saw two Indian men running away and boarded a pick-up truck. Of the two Indians, both Fairos and Geraldine Tan testified that one of them was a head taller than the other. This description matched Venketasan and Chandran; the height difference between them was about 18.5 cm. Aurea saw an Indian man holding a long pole and swinging it hard against the head of another Indian man.
There were discrepancies in the evidence of the three witnesses of the incident, and these discrepancies were relied upon by counsel to show that their evidence was not reliable. The trial judge, however, took into account the discrepancies in accepting their evidence. He said at [para ] 46: 
 
In my judgment, I do not think that these discrepancies affect the prosecution`s case. The witnesses were watching what was to them a horrible scene, viewed from different angles, each recalling different aspects of a quick and traumatic event. Fairos`s identification of Venkatesan and Chandran at the police identification parade was attacked by counsel as being unreliable. The incontrovertible facts are that Fairos gave Venkatesan`s identity to the police even before he was arrested, and both men accept that they were present at Phoenix Park at the material time.
 
 
 
We agreed with the trial judge. The discrepancies in their evidence were obviously due to a difference in their perception of an unexpected fast moving incident. They were not witnessing the attack at the same point in time, and they each saw a different part of the attack from different angles commencing from different times. Each was watching a quick and traumatic incident. In giving evidence, each was recalling different aspects of the incident, and understandably each gave a slightly different version. These discrepancies in their evidence of the incident were really not material.
The crucial fact here was that both Venketesan and Chandran admitted that they were at the scene at the material time. They said that their reason for being there was to speak to Maniam and negotiate a settlement with him and that they did not participate in attacking Maniam. The attack was carried out by one Mani who acted on his own. This version of the event was rejected by the learned judge who held that it could not possibly be true. The learned judge said at [para ] 48: 
 
This account fails to persuade me that it could possibly be true. I do not believe that Mani, a stranger just two weeks previously, went berserk and attacked Maniam on his own accord. I am inclined to the view that the circumstances at the time were such that the prevailing mood was hardly conducive to any amicable settlement, and certainly not one that was to be carried according to Venkatesan`s terms. Further, on his own evidence (supported by Chandran and Ravichandran) he was afraid that the very sight of him might invoke a hostile reaction by Maniam. That was why he did not present himself in the early attempts to catch Maniam. He became directly involved, in my view, by necessity when his main hired killer backed out. It is an obvious paradox that Venkatesan who was afraid to show his face to Maniam then became (on his own evidence) the driver of the truck who daringly drove right up to Maniam.
 
 
 
We agreed.
If the intention of Venkatesan was to negotiate with Maniam, it was extremely odd, to say the least, that he and his party should go and seek out Maniam at such an early hour in the morning, and that they were at Phoenix Garden before 6am and waited for about an hour before Maniam came out of his house. Secondly, neither Venkatesan nor Chandran really explained why the pick-up truck in which they travelled should have collided with Maniam`s car. The forensic evidence showed that the broken plastic found at the scene indicated that the pick-up truck hit Maniam`s car in a front to rear collision. Thirdly, there was the undisputed evidence that at the time of arrest of Chandran, a cut-out photograph of Maniam was found in his wallet. Together with this photograph was found also a piece of paper with the registration numbers of Maniam`s car and motor cycle. Chandran`s explanation was that the photograph was given to Meesai and subsequently handed to him for safe keeping. Meesai was the man who allegedly asked Venkatesan to pay him $10,000 before he would negotiate with Maniam. But no plausible explanation was given to account for the presence of that piece of paper with the vehicle numbers. Venkatesan said that he recorded the vehicle number sometime ago when he was under the impression that Maniam was stalking him after the court hearing. These explanations were inherently incredible in the circumstances. In our view, the only inference one could draw in this case was that the photograph and the numbers of the vehicles were given to Chandran for identifying Maniam for the purpose of killing him.
There was also the evidence of Chandran`s room-mate Tamilvanan which supported the finding of murder. His evidence was to the effect that when Ravichandran absconded with the money, Venkatesan assured Chandran that Julaiha would pay them more money once the job was completed. The same assurance was repeated when Chandran asked Venkatesan for money after Maniam`s death.
 Impeachment of Julaiha`s credit 
 
 
 
The final point which we need to discuss relates to the `impeachment proceedings` against Julaiha, on which the prosecution sought a ruling from this court. In the court below, based on the discrepancies between her evidence in court and her statements made to the police under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), the prosecution applied for leave for these statements to be used with a view to impeaching her credit. One discrepancy related to whether she entered Venkatesan`s room on the morning of 21 April 1999, at or about the time when Maniam was killed. In her evidence in court, she said that she did not enter Venkatesan`s room at that time and did not know if he was there, and that she never entered his room when he was sleeping. However, in her statement to the police she said that she entered the room, swept the floor and woke him up to do his painting but did not know whether he woke up or not. The other discrepancy concerned the purpose of a promissory note of $50,000 payable on 9 May 1999, which she made in favour of Venkatesan on 29 May 1998. In her evidence in court, she said that this note was made to deceive Venkatesan`s creditors in India into believing that he had money coming to him, and was not meant to be paid. In her statement to the police, she said that she promised Venkatesan that she would pay him $50,000 and that she might sell her property in India to pay him. The learned judge found that there were discrepancies and allowed the prosecution to cross-examine her with a view to impeaching her credit. Julaiha was then cross-examined on the previous inconsistent statements she had made. The learned judge in coming to his decision concluded thus at [para ] 61: 
 
I have taken these into account, as part of the evidence overall, when deciding whether or not her evidence has raised a reasonable doubt in my mind.
 
 
 
Before us, in the written submissions, the prosecution argued that the learned judge should have made a ruling that Julaiha`s credit was impeached upon her failure to give a credible explanation for the discrepancies. Mr Palakrishnan for Julaiha, on the other hand, argued that the absence of this ruling supported his argument that Julaiha`s credit before the learned judge was not impeached. Both arguments were premised on a supposedly legal requirement that at a certain stage of the trial the learned judge ought to make a ruling whether Julaiha`s credit was or was not impeached by reason of the previous statements being permitted to be used.
The prosecution relied on the oft-cited case of 
Muthusamy v PP
 
 
[1948] MLJ 57
  and submitted that the court ought to make a ruling in its judgment on the credit of the witness as a result of the impeachment exercise. We do not think that 
 Muthusamy 
 supports such a conclusion. That case concerned the application of the then s 124, which is now s 122(2) of the CPC, which allowed a statement made to the police by a 
 witness 
 (who is not the accused) to be used only for the purpose of impeaching the credit of the witness. Taylor J there laid down the steps which the court should take when a party, be it the accused or the prosecution, seeks to show that the witness has made a previous statement to the police which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence given in court with a view to impeaching his credit. The use of such statement is only allowed, `if the court thinks it expedient in the interest of justice`. Hence, he said that before allowing the statements to be used, the court must first be satisfied that the discrepancies between the former statement and the evidence in court were so serious or material as to suggest that the witness is unreliable. If so, the court may permit the witness to be asked whether he made the alleged statement. If he denied having made it, the matter must be dropped or the document must be formally proved. Taylor J then went on to say at p 59: 
 
If the witness admits making the statement or is proved to have made it, then the two conflicting versions must be carefully explained to him; preferably by the court, and he must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference. If he can, then his credit is saved, though there may still be doubt as to the accuracy of his memory. This procedure is cumbersome and slow and therefore should not be used unless the apparent discrepancy is material to the issue.
 
 
 
The learned judge certainly did not say anything to the effect that the court must make a ruling whether the credit of the witness is saved or impeached.
In 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
 , at p 861, this court said: 
 
The appellant was referred to the statements he made and since he did not appear to admit them, the trial judges conducted a trial-within-a-trial and at the conclusion determined that the statements were made by the appellant voluntarily. Thereafter cross-examination of the appellant continued, after which his counsel re-examined him. For some inexplicable reason, at that point of time counsel for the appellant strenuously urged the trial judges to make a ruling whether the credit of the appellant had been impeached. The trial judges declined, and in our view, rightly, and held that they would determine that issue at the close of the case. There is no reason whatsoever why the trial judges should make any ruling at that stage as requested by counsel. In our opinion, counsel was in error. The use of the s 121 statements to impeach the credit of the appellant was part of the cross-examination by the prosecution and does not call for any special ruling at that stage.
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that the above pronouncement is only an authority for the proposition that there was no requirement to make a specific ruling on impeachment only at that stage, namely, at the end of the `impeachment exercise`. However, such ruling was required to be made, and should be made, at the end of the trial. The prosecution relied on 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 , where Yong Pung How CJ made some observations with regard to the ruling on the impeachment of credit of a witness. The learned Chief Justice said at p 605: 
 
At the close of the impeachment proceedings, the judge is not obliged to make a ruling on the matter immediately. As a matter of fact, the impeachment proceedings are part of the cross-examination process and do not call for any special ruling at that stage (ie at the close of the impeachment proceedings). This has been pointed out by the Court of Appeal in 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
 . In Malaysia, the Federal Court in 
Dato Moktar bin Hashim & Anor v PP
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
  held that the witness`s credit stands to be assessed as a whole together with the rest of the evidence at the appropriate stage, that is to say, at the close of the case for the prosecution or for the defence, as the case may be. Therefore, in my judgment, it is apt for the court to make a ruling on the impeachment proceedings at the close of the case together with the rest of the evidence tendered.
 
 
 
This concluding sentence was relied upon by the prosecution as laying down the rule that the court must make a ruling whether the credit of the witness has been impeached. With respect, this is not so. The last sentence must be read in the context of the whole judgment, and in our view does not lay down any such a rule as contended on behalf of the prosecution. Even if such a rule was there laid down, it is not an immutable rule in the evaluation of the evidence.
It seems to us that there has been some confusion in the submissions made before us. In this case, s 122(2) of the CPC is not applicable for the simple reason that the witness, who was being cross-examined on the previous statements made to the police, was Julaiha herself, the accused. Instead, it is s 122(5) of the CPC which is applicable, and under this section any statement made by her `to or at the hearing of any police officer above the rank of sergeant` was admissible at her trial, and, as she herself was a witness, the prosecution was entitled to use it in the cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching her credit, provided that such statement was made voluntarily. By reason of this subsection, which was not in existence at the time of 
 Muthusamy 
, the prosecution is not required to go through the `cumbersome and slow` procedure laid down by Taylor J. There was no need for the prosecution to apply to court for permission to use the statements made by Julaiha, as appeared to have been done here. Section 122(5) does not require any such permission to be sought.
We now turn to the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed). Section 147 sets out the procedure to be followed in cross-examining a witness with respect to previous statements made by him. That section, in so far as relevant, provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. 
 
(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such statement.
  
 
 
Next, there is s 157 of the Evidence Act which prescribes the ways in which the credit of a witness may be impeached. So far as relevant, that section provides: 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
 
(a) ... 
 
(b) ... 
 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; 
 
(d) ...
  
 
 
We also do not find in these provisions of the Evidence Act any procedure such as that laid down by Taylor J which is required to be followed.
It should be remembered that impeaching the credit of a witness is not confined to previous inconsistent statements made to the police under the CPC. Statements made by a witness in other situation, verbal or written, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence given in court, upon proof of such statements, may be used by counsel for the opposing side to impeach his credit. A witness` credit may also be impeached by reference to evidence the witness has given at the trial, say in the examination in chief, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence in cross-examination. Such a manner of impeaching the credit of a witness is no different from that adopted in impeaching the credit of a witness in cases falling under s 122(2) or of an accused under s 122(5) of the CPC (as the case may be) with respect to a previous statement made by the witness or accused to the police. To impeach his credit is to attack the credibility of his evidence. In 
 Kwang Boon Keong Peter 
 (supra) at p 602, Yong Pung How CJ said: 
 
To impeach a witness`s credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of impeachment of a witness`s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on.
 
 
 
In our opinion, there is no requirement that the trial judge must, at any stage of the trial, make a ruling on whether the credit of the witness is impeached. All that is required is that the court must consider the discrepancies and the explanation proffered by the witness for the purpose of an overall assessment of his credibility. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that an impeachment of the witness`s credit does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinize the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: see 
PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
  (HC) and 
 Kwang Boon Keong Peter 
 (supra). Thus, regardless of whether his credit is impeached, the duty of the court remains, that is, to evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspect to believe. Reverting to the present case, the learned judge was clearly correct when he said that he took into consideration the two discrepancies in deciding whether to accept Julaiha`s evidence. There was absolutely nothing wrong with this approach.
 Conclusion

: This was an appeal against the decision of district judge Suriakumari Sidambaram where she convicted the appellant of an offence under s 381 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for abetting one Muthusamy Kanan (`Kanan`) in the commission of theft as a servant, in that he intentionally aided Kanan by arranging for a vehicle to transport stolen goods and assisting in getting a place to store such stolen goods until a buyer could be found. The appellant was sentenced to 15 months` imprisonment. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The re-amended charge against the appellant read as follows: 
 
DAC 10988/99
 
 
 
You, Selvarajan James, Male/40 years, NRIC No 1292197G, are charged that you, on 22 January 1998, at or about 7.30pm, at Thyssen Haniel Logistics Centre located at No 10 Changi South Street 2, Singapore, did abet one Muthusamy Kanan, employed in the capacity of a warehouse assistant with M/s Thyssen Haniel Logistics (S) Pte Ltd, in the commission of the offence of theft as a servant, in that you intentionally aided the said Muthusamy Kanan, to wit, by arranging for a vehicle to transport the stolen goods, to wit, three hundred pieces of Sanyo CL7-X6 cordless telephones valued at $97 each, amounting to a total value of $29,100, from the warehouse at the said Thyssen Haniel Logistics Centre and assisting in getting a place to keep the said goods in the interim until a buyer was found for the stolen goods, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence under s 381 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
Some time during the day on 22 January 1998, Kanan contacted the appellant and asked the appellant to assist in obtaining transport for some goods and in looking for a place to store the goods. The appellant managed to procure one `Singh` to provide the transport for Kanan. At about 7pm on 22 January 1998, the appellant and Singh arrived at Thyssen Haniel Logistics Centre (`THLC`), where Kanan was a warehouse assistant, in a white lorry.
The appellant introduced Singh to Kanan and Kanan then gave instructions for 60 cartons containing cordless telephones worth $29,100 to be loaded onto the lorry. Although the appellant claimed that he was sitting in the passenger seat during the loading process, the trial judge found on the evidence that it was the appellant and Singh who loaded the goods onto the lorry.
Singh asked Kanan for the delivery order or any other documents relating to the goods to be taken out of the warehouse but seemed to accept Kanan`s explanation that they were not required. The appellant never asked for any documents.
After the loading of the 60 cartons had been completed, Singh and the appellant tried to leave the premises in the lorry but the gate to the warehouse was closed. The security guard had been ordered not to let anybody leave the premises without the authorisation of the warehouse executive, one Lee Chen Seng Michael, who had been tipped off that Kanan was `up to something`. However, Kanan told the security guard that the people in the lorry were his friends who only came to `chit-chat` with him. The guard subsequently allowed the lorry to leave the premises.
The goods were brought to a shophouse in the Newton area and unloaded. In the meantime, the police were informed of the theft. Kanan then paged the appellant and told him that the police had arrived at THLC and to return the goods immediately. The appellant testified that, on being informed that the goods needed to be returned, Singh became very upset and refused to do so. Two taxis were therefore hired to transport the goods back to THLC.
The appellant rode in one of the taxis but alighted at Bedok, allegedly to attend to his son who was sick. However, the trial judge found from the evidence that he alighted in Bedok merely to return to his residence there. The 60 cartons of goods were returned in their entirety to THLC in the two taxis, unaccompanied by any passenger, at about 11.20pm on 22 January 1998.
Kanan gave the appellant`s pager number to the investigating officer, Insp Brian Stampe (the `IO`), who tried to contact the appellant but to no avail. The trial judge dismissed the appellant`s claims that he spoke to the IO and had made himself `contactable and available to go to the station any time` and instead accepted the IO`s evidence that the appellant never contacted him at all. The appellant remained at large until almost a year later, when he was arrested on 10 January 1999.
Kanan was charged under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) on 24 January 1998. He pleaded guilty to that charge and was sentenced to 24 months` imprisonment.
 Decision of the trial judge 
 
 
 
The only issue in question was whether the appellant had the requisite intention to aid Kanan in the commission of the offence. The appellant`s contention was that he had no knowledge that the goods in question were stolen and that his role was merely to provide transport for Kanan.
The trial judge tested the appellant`s contention against the evidence adduced. Firstly, Kanan made two statements to the police (marked `P9` and `P10`) - one on 23 January 1998, the day after the offence was committed and another on 24 March 1999, after his conviction under s 381 of the Penal Code - stating categorically that the appellant knew that the goods in question were stolen goods. The voluntariness of these statements was not questioned. Although Kanan testified in court that the appellant did not know that the goods were stolen, the trial judge found Kanan`s two earlier statements, one of which was contemporaneous with the offence, to contain the truth and accepted that the appellant knew that the goods were stolen.
Further, even if Kanan had not expressly told the appellant that the goods were stolen, the trial judge felt that the appellant had at the very least wilfully shut his eyes to the theft. The lack of requisite documents, the large volume of goods and the fact that it was after office hours when the goods were loaded should have put the appellant on notice that all was not innocent. The appellant, however, did not make any enquiries at all.
The trial judge also scrutinised all the circumstantial evidence - (a) the fact that the appellant travelled with the transport to the warehouse and then to the place of storage and helped to load and unload the goods; (b) the fact that the appellant did not come forward and remained at large for almost a year, although he knew that the police were looking for him; and (c) the fact that the appellant felt the need to lie that he did not help to load the goods onto the lorry and about having to rush back to his sick son on the evening of 22 January 1998 - and came to the inevitable and inexorable conclusion that the appellant was an active participant and abetted in the offence he was charged with.
The trial judge noted that the sentence generally passed on a first offender who has stolen items worth about $10,000 is 12 months` imprisonment. The goods that were stolen in the present case were worth $29,100. The trial judge also took into account that the offence was committed deliberately and involved an element of abuse of trust. She was also informed that the accomplice, Kanan, had been sentenced to 24 months` imprisonment. As such, the trial judge felt that a sentence of 15 months` imprisonment would be appropriate in this present case to reflect the gravity of the offence and to serve as a deterrent both for the appellant and the public.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. As against his conviction, the main grounds stated by the appellant in his petition of appeal were that, firstly, the trial judge erred by choosing to accept Kanan`s version of the facts as stated in his two statements to the police as opposed to his testimony in court; secondly, that the trial judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the fact that Kanan had pleaded guilty to the charge against him under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the fact that he admitted to the statement of facts with respect to that charge without any qualification; and finally, that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence before her. As against his sentence, the appellant argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the mitigating factors and imposed an excessive sentence.
 The motion to adduce additional evidence 
 
 
 
In the course of preparing for the appeal, the appellant discovered that Kanan had in fact made a total of three statements to the police. Only the two statements marked `P9` and `P10` were adduced during the trial in the lower court and the appellant was not aware of the existence of a third statement (the `third statement`) during the trial. This third statement was apparently exculpatory in nature. The appellant therefore applied by way of criminal motion for the court to order that the prosecution be directed to produce the third statement and for leave to adduce the third statement as fresh evidence.
The procedure for criminal discovery in Singapore is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the `CPC`). The CPC does not impose on the prosecution an onerous duty of disclosure. This differs from the requirements in civil cases where extensive rules of discovery are provided for in the Rules of Court. For criminal cases, there is no requirement in the CPC for the prosecution to disclose witnesses` statements to the defence. In this case, the prosecution did not intend to rely on the third statement given by Kanan and was not compelled by law to disclose or produce the statement to the defence.
The present duty of disclosure on the part of the prosecution in criminal cases, as provided for in the CPC, is minimal. This position is not necessarily the most ideal and it has been argued on numerous occasions that more disclosure and early disclosure on the part of the prosecution are desirable to ensure that the accused knows the case that has to be met and as such would get a fairer trial. However, it is not for this court to impose such requirements on the prosecution. It is for Parliament to decide if it wants to enact these revisions when it updates the CPC and, until then, the court cannot direct the prosecution to produce witnesses` statements to the defence.
Even if the prosecution had voluntarily disclosed and produced the third statement to the appellant, the relevant principles had to be applied before the third statement could be adduced as fresh evidence during the appeal. The applicable provision in the CPC is s 257 (1) which reads as follows: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken be a District Court or Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
The three-fold test for when additional evidence is deemed to be `necessary` was set out in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  (and followed recently in the cases of 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
  and 
Lee Yuen Hong v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
 ), which adopted the test in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
: 
 
first it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 
 
 
 
 (1) It must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial
 
Applying the first of the three conditions above to the present case, it was reasonable for the appellant not to have suspected that the third statement had been made because there was no evidence adduced to suggest that such a statement existed. Therefore the first condition was satisfied.
 (2) The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive
However, it was clear that the second condition was not satisfied. Although the trial judge did place some emphasis on Kanan`s two statements which implicated the appellant, she was prepared to convict the applicant on the strong circumstantial evidence alone. Section 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) could be used to argue for the presumption that the third statement contained exculpatory statements that could have an important influence on the result of the case since the appellant contended that the prosecution was aware of the third statement during the trial but chose not to adduce it as evidence. Section 116(g) of the Evidence Act states that the court may presume that `evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it`. However, even if the third statement were adduced as evidence and found to be unfavourable to the prosecution, the strong circumstantial evidence pointing to the applicant`s knowledge that the goods were stolen suggested that the third statement would not have an important influence on the result of the case, and would not have been crucial to the proper determination of the case. Therefore the second condition was not satisfied.
 (3) The evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible
Considering Kanan`s wavering testimony with respect to the applicant`s state of mind, I was of the opinion that, even if the third statement were admitted, minimal weight should be attached to it. After all, Kanan did make two inculpatory statements, one of which was made just the day after the offence. He then reversed his stance during the trial by testifying that the appellant did not know that the goods were stolen and claimed that he had lied in the two previous statements. The reasons he gave during the trial, to substantiate his claim that he lied in those two statements, were unconvincing and dismissed by the trial judge, who found that his previous two statements contained the truth. The third statement, which the appellant claimed to be exculpatory, could not be `such as is presumably to be believed` because Kanan`s credibility with respect to his statements regarding the applicant`s state of mind had been undermined by his wavering testimony. Therefore the third condition was also not satisfied.
For the reasons above, I denied the motion moved by the appellant. The court had no power in law to order the prosecution to produce Kanan`s third statement and, even if the third statement were in the appellant`s possession, the court would not have granted leave for such a statement to be adduced, as fresh evidence for the purposes of the appeal, as it would not have satisfied the test set out in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 (supra).
 Appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Whether the trial judge erred when she chose to place more credibility on Kanan`s two statements made to the police as opposed to his evidence in court
 
Kanan`s two statements were admitted as evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Section 147(6) provides guidance as to the weight to be attached to such statements: 
 
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
In the case of 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd & Anor
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
 , I said that, in addition to the above, other factors that will affect the weight accorded to such previous inconsistent statements are: (1) an explanation of the inconsistency, and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts; (2) the context of the whole statement and the circumstances affecting its accuracy; and (3) the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon.
This issue was further expounded by the Court of Appeal in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
  where I said: 
 
First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time but the recollection of the existence of a relationship is not so malleable. Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, in addition to the above matters, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts. Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.
 
 
 
Applying the above factors to Kanan`s statements P9 and P10, I noted that firstly, the first statement made by Kanan was contemporaneous with the offence, having been made on 23 January 1998, just a day after the offence. Secondly, Kanan`s explanation of the inconsistency and why these statements were an inaccurate representation of the facts was that his statements implicating the appellant were made because he was angry with the appellant for delaying the return of the goods and that, if not for this delay, he would not have to go to jail. I find Kanan`s explanation incredible because the second statement was made when Kanan had already been convicted and knew he had to go to jail. Furthermore, the trial judge noted that, with his previous convictions for property offences, Kanan could not have been so naÃ¯ve as to believe that he would be allowed to go free after stealing $29,100 worth of goods, just because the goods were returned. Both statements were made to police officers and Kanan did not dispute the voluntariness of the two statements, which were consistent with each other. In the first statement P10 recorded on 23 Janaury 1998, Kanan stated that he spoke to the appellant on the telephone and `I told him that I could get some items and asked him if he could clear the items for me. He then said okay and told me to inform of when and where to pick up the items`. Then in the second statement P9, recorded when Kanan had already been convicted and was in prison, Kanan said that the appellant `knew that the items were stolen goods as I told him of the plan. He assured me that he has a buyer`. When I examined these statements, I did not detect any ambivalence on the part of Kanan when he was making these statements. Kanan was stating unequivocally that the appellant was aware that that the goods in question were stolen.
Having considered the above factors, I found that the trial judge was entitled to place more weight on Kanan`s two statements than on his testimony in court. I found that the trial judge scrutinised Kanan`s evidence with great care and tested it against the objective facts and evidence. She was mindful that Kanan was an accomplice but nevertheless found that Kanan`s evidence in his two statements was corroborated by the evidence given by the other prosecution witnesses and the other circumstantial evidence.
 Whether the trial judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the fact that Kanan had pleaded guilty to the charge against him under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the fact that he admitted to the statement of facts with respect to that charge without any qualification
Kanan`s guilty plea and the fact that he had admitted to the statement of facts with respect to the charge against him (marked `P8`) without any qualification were factors that were taken into account by the trial judge in coming to the conclusion that Kanan`s two statements to the police contain the truth. The statement of facts detailed the appellant`s role in the theft and was consistent with the two statements made by Kanan. The statement of facts was not at any time challenged during the trial. These factors were taken into account as part of the totality of evidence against the appellant and I could see nothing to suggest that undue emphasis was placed by the trial judge on these factors. In my opinion, the appeal on this ground contained absolutely no merit.
 Whether the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence before her 
 
 
 
As regards Kanan`s evidence on the appellant`s state of mind, I applied the relevant principles above and concluded that the trial judge was entitled to place more weight on Kanan`s previous statements P9 and P10 than on his testimony in court.
As regards the appellant`s evidence, the trial judge chose to disbelieve the appellant`s contention that he did not know that the goods were stolen. The inference that the appellant had the relevant knowledge was supported by strong circumstantial evidence and inconsistent testimony from the appellant. The appellant claimed that he was not close to Kanan, yet he went to a great extent to help him. The appellant claimed that his role was simply to provide transport for Kanan, yet he travelled with the lorry to THLC and then to the place of storage, and also helped to load and unload the goods, which suggested active participation in the offence. Also, the appellant never made any enquiries about the goods despite circumstances that should have put him on notice that something was amiss, leading the trial judge to conclude that he must have at least shut his eyes to the offence. The appellant claimed that he had spoken to the IO and had made himself contactable by the police, yet he remained at large for almost a year and never came forward despite knowing that the police were looking for him. The appellant found it necessary to lie that he could not return to the THLC on the night of the offence because his son was sick but admitted on cross-examination that he never brought his son to the hospital that night. In fact, the IO testified that the appellant`s wife, who stayed with their son, said that she had not seen the appellant for some time, which led to the inference that the appellant did not see his son that night. The IO`s testimony in this respect was not challenged by the defence.
It was held by the High Court in 
Simon Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 196
  that `an accused should not be convicted merely because his defence is tenuous or because a trial judge disbelieves his defence`. However, I was of the view that, in the present case, the trial judge had good reasons to disbelieve the appellant`s defence that he did not know that the goods were stolen because this conclusion was supported by Kanan`s statements and strong circumstantial evidence. In fact, even without having regard to Kanan`s statements, I was of the opinion that, taking into account the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence, it was not unreasonable for the trial judge to make the `irresistible inference` that the appellant had the requisite guilty knowledge, satisfying the test in 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
 SLR 67 
; [1966[rcub ] 2 MLJ 195.
It is settled law that an appellate court should be slow to disturb a trial judge`s finding of fact when he has had the opportunity to assess the witnesses. Reference can be made to 
PP v Victor Rajoo
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
 , where the Court of Appeal stated that : 
 
The learned trial judge, who had had the benefit of seeing and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the learned trial judge`s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision.
 
 
 
Having examined the evidence, I can see no reason for me to conclude that the trial judge has clearly reached a wrong decision. The trial judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses and after considering the totality of the evidence, she had `no doubt whatsoever` about the appellant`s guilt. I saw nothing to suggest that she failed to consider all the evidence before her. It is very clear to me that the appellant was no mere spectator as far as the theft was concerned and was indeed an active participant in the offence. I find his claim that he had no knowledge that the goods were stolen far-fetched.
For the reasons above, I upheld the trial judge`s decision and dismissed the appeal against the appellant`s conviction.
 Appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The only mitigation factor put forward by the appellant was that the goods were returned and that the appellant did not derive any benefit from them. However, the evidence clearly showed that he only returned the goods on the instructions of Kanan when the police had already arrived at THLC, and not because he suffered from a guilty conscience or was filled with remorse. As such, I was of the view that the fact that the appellant arranged for the goods to be returned should not weigh heavily in his favour.
Taking into account the value of the goods stolen and the fact that Kanan received a sentence of 24 months` imprisonment, I found the sentence of 15 months` imprisonment not to be excessive and I saw no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge.
 Grounds not stated in petition of appeal 
 
 
 
I would like to address a final point. In the written submissions for the purposes of the appeal, the appellant raised new contentions that were not stated in his petition of appeal and were also not raised at the trial below. Also, these submissions containing contentions that had never been brought up before were submitted at a very late hour. The court frowns upon such behaviour exhibited by counsel. Any respondent before the court, be it the accused or the prosecution, deserves a fair chance to know the issues that are to be raised so that there will be ample time for him to prepare his case. Fresh allegations or contentions made at a very late hour are highly discouraged by the court.
In any event, I found that the fresh grounds of appeal stated in the written submissions of the appellant contained no merit whatsoever. Furthermore, counsel for the appellant chose not to argue these points before me in open court during the appeal. These contentions were baseless and did not affect the result of the appeal.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons stated above, I denied the criminal motion and dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence.

: Before district judge Kow Keng Siong on 16 February 2000, the respondent pleaded guilty to four charges, namely, one count of vandalism under s 3 of the Vandalism Act (Cap 341), committed when he cut his Electronic Monitoring Scheme (`EMS`) tag, and three counts of failing to report for urine testing contrary to reg 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations 1976.

Nevertheless, I have set out these grounds to provide some clarification on the issues before the court.
 Background 
 
 
 
The case on revision concerned offences committed while the respondent was undergoing supervision following his release from the reformative training centre (`RTC`). The respondent was first sentenced to reformative training for offences relating to robbery and misuse of drugs on 10 March 1997. He served 31 months and 24 days of this sentence before being released from the reformative training centre into aftercare supervision on 3 November 1999. This supervision was to expire on 9 March 2001. Pursuant to para 13, Sch D of the CPC, two of the conditions of supervision were that the respondent agree to be subject to urine tests as directed by his aftercare officer and that the respondent abide by the EMS agreement.
The respondent failed to present himself for urine testing on 3, 5 and 7 January. On 9 January 2000, he cut off his EMS tag. In addition, he had breached other conditions of his release with regard to his employment, curfew hours at home and reporting to his aftercare officer. On 13 January 2000, the respondent was remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison on the present charges. An Order for Recall to the reformative training centre was subsequently issued on 25 January 2000. The respondent pleaded guilty to the present charges on 16 February 2000.
 The petition for revision 
 
 
 
I allowed a similar petition for revision on 6 April 2000 and this is reported at 
PP v Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 17
 . In that case, I referred to the reformative training regime provided in Sch D of the CPC, and referred specifically to para 4 of that Schedule, which reads: 
 
If any person while under supervision, or after his recall to a reformative training centre, as aforesaid, is sentenced to corrective training or reformative training his original sentence of reformative training shall cease to have effect; and if any such person is so sentenced to imprisonment, any period for which he is imprisoned under that sentence shall count as part of the period for which he is liable to detention in a reformative training centre under his original sentence.
 
 
 
I found that para 4 applied to fact scenarios such as that of the present petition where a respondent was sentenced for offences committed during the supervision period following release from RTC. It was clear that in such circumstances, the existing RTC sentence `ceased to have effect` and the new RTC sentence should commence on the date of his conviction of the fresh offences.
However, some clarification is needed on the authorities discussed. The district judge in 
 PP v Mohamed Noor 
 had relied on 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
  as holding any imposition of consecutive orders of reformative training to be inappropriate. Hence the order that the second sentence of reformative training was to commence on the same date as the first. In distinguishing 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
, greater emphasis should be placed on the practical implications of these different fact patterns. In Ng Kwok Fai, I expressed the view that a sentence of imprisonment immediately consequent to reformative training would run counter to the aim of reformative training as it could undo what the reformative training was meant to do. I also held that consecutive terms of reformative training were not desirable, and hence ordered the second reformative training sentence imposed in 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 to commence on the same date as the first.
This is to be distinguished from the fact sequence in cases such as Mohamed Noor and the present petition, where RTC sentences are ordered for offences committed while the respondent is under supervision post-RTC release. In these cases, the fact that an order for reformative training falls consecutive to a separate term of reformative training does not run counter to the aim of reformative training. This is because it is ordered after the respondent has substantially performed one sentence of reformative training. In other words, it is after the respondent has been given sufficient opportunity to benefit from reformative training. Paragraph 4 of Sch D provides that in such instances the first term of reformative training then ceases to have effect. It then falls to judicial discretion whether or not to order reformative training or imprisonment for the fresh charges. The fact of having committed offences while on supervision may indicate the success or otherwise of reformative training on the particular respondent and perhaps his personal resolve to `turn over a new leaf`. If the conviction so warrants, the court may order imprisonment. In this case, on the respondent`s charge of vandalism, he was liable to a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to three years and caning of not less than three strokes and not more than eight strokes. The court below was of the view that reformative training remained appropriate for the respondent. Furthermore, I noted the respondent`s submissions in mitigation and his father`s involvement in the present application provided encouraging signs not to disturb the order for reformative training.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For these reasons, I allowed the Public Prosecutor`s petition and revised the sentence of reformative training to commence on 16 February 2000.

: The respondent pleaded guilty in the magistrate`s court on 20 March 2000 to two charges of intruding upon the privacy of a woman under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He was sentenced by magistrate Brenda Tan to a fine of $1,000 on each of the two charges. The prosecution appealed against this sentence as being manifestly inadequate. I allowed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to one month`s imprisonment on each charge, to run consecutively, in addition to the fine imposed by the magistrate. I now give my reasons.
 The charges 
 
 
 
The charges against the respondent read as follows: 
 
MAC 921/2000
 
 
 
You, Tay Beng Guan Albert, m/34 years, NRIC: S1732995-B are charged that, you on 3 January 2000 at about 1pm, at the master bedroom bathroom of Blk 27 Hume Ave [num ]07-01 Hume Park 2, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of one Lee Hsu Ching Lynette, to wit, by filming her in an undressed state without her knowledge, with your video camcorder, intending to intrude upon the privacy of the said victim, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
And 
 
MAC 922/2000
 
 
 
You, Tay Beng Guan Albert, m/34 years, NRIC: S1732995-B are charged that, you sometime in November 1998, in the evening, at the master bedroom bathroom of Blk 27 Hume Ave [num ]07-01 Hume Park 2, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of one Koh Lay Tin Sandy, to wit, by filming the whole process of how the said subject eased herself in the toilet, without her knowledge, with your video camcorder, intending to intrude upon the privacy of the said victim, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
At about 1pm on 3 January 2000, the respondent and one Lee Hsu Ching Lynette (`Lee`) went to the respondent`s house after a game of squash. Lee was then a colleague of the respondent.
Lee requested to use the guest bathroom to take a shower. The respondent led her to the bathroom located in the master bedroom, where she proceeded to take a shower. After her shower, Lee noticed a camera lens hidden among a basket of soft toys, with the lens pointing directly at the toilet door which was made of glass.
Lee checked and discovered that it was a Sony video-camcorder which was switched on and in recording mode. She then removed the tape and replaced the video-camcorder back in its original position.
Lee brought the tape home to view its contents. The recording showed Lee undressing and stepping into the bathtub, and thereafter stepping out of the bathtub naked, drying herself and covering herself with a bath towel.
Lee then lodged a police report about the incident.
The tape also contained footage of another woman, one Koh Lay Tin Sandy (`Koh`), who was the respondent`s ex-colleague. Investigations revealed that sometime in November 1998 the respondent and Koh had dinner before proceeding to the respondent`s house to listen to music.
At the respondent`s house, Koh requested to use the bathroom and was led by the respondent to the bathroom in the master bedroom. The respondent switched the video-camcorder, which was similarly hidden in a basket of soft toys, to recording mode before allowing Koh to enter the bathroom.
The recording on the tape showed the entire process of Koh relieving herself in the toilet.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The magistrate was satisfied that the respondent understood the nature and consequences of his pleas of guilt and found him guilty on both charges.
In mitigation, the respondent submitted that he had fallen for both Lee and Koh but saw no future in getting involved with them as he was married. He committed the present offences because he wanted some sort of closeness with them.
Five specific mitigation factors were highlighted. First, the respondent was filled with deep remorse and pleaded guilty. As such, Lee and Koh were spared the trauma of testifying in court. Also, the respondent co-operated with the police and furnished them with the identity and particulars of Koh. Secondly, the respondent had apologised to Lee and Koh and sought their forgiveness. Thirdly, the respondent was a first offender who had worked his way up from a disadvantaged background and he had resolved not to transgress the law again. Fourthly, the respondent was seeking psychological help and undergoing counselling. Finally, the respondent cited his good character and the fact that he was well respected by peers and friends.
The magistrate took into account the facts of the case and the mitigation plea and imposed a $1,000 fine on the respondent on each of the two charges. Her reasons for the sentences were threefold. First, the usual benchmark for a first offender who pleaded guilty to an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code was a fine, and therefore a fine was applicable here, as there were no aggravating factors. Secondly, the respondent was a first offender who was repentant and on his way to being rehabilitated. Thirdly, the magistrate considered the case of 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 . In that case, the accused was, inter alia, charged and convicted under s 509 of the Penal Code for peeping at a lady taking her bath through a hole he made in the bathroom door (the `peeping offence`). The magistrate noted that, in that case, I had reduced the one month jail term imposed by the district court for the peeping offence to a fine of $2,000. She felt that the facts in that case were no less aggravating than the facts in the present case and therefore a fine in the present case would similarly suffice.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The prosecution appealed against the fine imposed by the magistrate as being manifestly inadequate. Some of the prosecution`s main contentions were as follows:
 Undue emphasis on the respondent`s plea of guilt 
 
 
 
The prosecution contended that the magistrate placed undue emphasis on the respondent`s expression of remorse and plea of guilt. The prosecution cited the case of 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
  at p 539 where I commented that `there is no mitigation value in a plea of guilt, if the offender pleads guilty in circumstances in which he knows that the prosecution would have no difficulty proving the charge against him; or if he had been caught red-handed`. In that case, I agreed with Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) who said in 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 1011
 , 1014; 
[1991] 1 MLJ 321
, 323 that `I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up`.
There is no doubt that the respondent in the present case was caught red-handed. The video tape that Lee handed over to the police contained hard evidence of the crimes committed by the respondent. The respondent would have known that the prosecution would have no difficulty proving the charge against him. With respect, given the facts in the present case, I was of the view that the respondent`s plea of guilt should have little or no mitigation value and that the magistrate erred in taking the view that `adequate weight should be attached to his plea of guilt`.
 Pre-meditated and well-planned offence 
 
 
 
The magistrate cited my decision in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case to support her view that a fine would suffice in cases of this nature. However, the prosecution pointed out that the present case should be distinguished because the offences committed by the respondent in the present case were pre-meditated and well-planned. The respondent replied by contending that the peeping offence committed in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case was equally pre-meditated and well-planned, because the accused in that case had made a hole in the bathroom door in order to peep at the victim taking her bath.
It seemed very clear to me that the degree of culpability in the present case was very much greater than that in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case for the peeping offence. In the present case, there must have been a lot of meticulous planning on the respondent`s part in order to commit the offences. The respondent had to hide the video-camcorder in the basket of soft toys in the toilet and then carefully position the lens to point at the toilet door. Furthermore, the respondent had to switch the video-camcorder to recording mode quickly and discreetly before he allowed each of Lee and Koh to use the bathroom. Such a 
 modus operandi 
 surely required more planning and pre-meditation than peeping through a hole in the bathroom door.
I was therefore of the opinion that the magistrate erred by likening the present situation to that in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case. I felt that the high degree of planning needed for the commission of the present offences rendered the situation here more aggravating than that in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case.
 Nature of offence 
 
 
 
Most importantly, I felt that the nature of the present offences merited the utmost consideration. The prosecution rightly contended that the magistrate failed to consider that, if the tape had not been seized, the respondent could have played the tape many times over for his own perverted gratification. With respect, in comparing the present offences to the peeping offence in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case, the magistrate totally failed to consider the unique nature of the present offences.
Unlike other `peeping tom` cases where the offender peeps at the victim in person at one moment in time, the respondent here did not actually observe Lee and Koh in their private moments in person. He chose to record their private moments on tape, so that he could watch them again and again for his own perverted pleasure. The potential for repeated viewings made the nature of the offences in the present case wholly distinguishable from that in 
 Tan Pin Seng 
`s case.
What the respondent essentially did in this case was to convert his bathroom into a `studio` to record the private moments of his women friends without their knowledge. Video-camcorders are available freely in this age of modern technology and policy considerations dictate that a deterrent sentence has to be imposed to indicate that offences of this nature will not be tolerated. I cannot send a message to the public that it is acceptable to make recordings of others without their knowledge as long as one has the financial resources to pay a fine. It was fortunate that the video tape in the present case was discovered by Lee. Should the tape have fallen into the hands of other third parties, the trauma and embarrassment that the victims would have had to endure would have been unimaginable. The fact that a victim`s private moments could be recorded without the victim`s knowledge and replayed over and over again for another`s perverted pleasure coupled with the risk of possible circulation of such tapes to other people compelled me to impose a custodial sentence in this case to make it clear that the court does not condone such behaviour or treat it lightly.
In my opinion, the magistrate was clearly wrong to take the view that a fine was sufficient and that there were no aggravating factors to justify imposing a custodial sentence.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In deciding what the appropriate sentence to be meted out in the present case was, I took note of all the mitigating factors in the respondent`s favour that were raised in the lower court. The respondent appeared to be truly remorseful and was undergoing counselling to rehabilitate himself.
As I said in 
 PP v Tan Fook Sum 
 (supra) at p 540, `policy considerations, the gravity of the offence including the particular facts and circumstances thereof all mandated the imposition of a custodial sentence`.
For the reasons above, I allowed the appeal and sentenced the respondent to one month`s imprisonment on each charge, to run consecutively. The fines were ordered to remain.

 Introduction 
The appellant, a former police officer, was convicted in the district court under s 6 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (`PCA`) on 14 counts of corruption. He was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge, with the first two sentences running consecutively. Being dissatisfied with his conviction and sentences, he appealed to me. I dismissed his appeal, and I now set forth my reasons.
 Background 
 
 
 
The prosecution alleged that on 14 occasions, between August 1995 and March 1997, the appellant had corruptly accepted gratification amounting to some $10,900 from one Roland Tay Hai Choon (`DW2`), in return for supplying the latter with confidential information which he had obtained in the course of his duties as a police hearse driver. At the relevant times, the appellant was a corporal in the Singapore Police Force, and also the designated police hearse driver. When the police hearse was required, the Police Activation Division would radio him with the necessary information relating to the location of the dead bodies. His duties were to transport workers, engaged by the police to remove bodies, to the given location, and then to convey the bodies to the mortuary. The confidential information which he had allegedly released to DW2 were the names and addresses of the deceased persons that he transported in the police hearse, and the contact numbers and names of those deceased persons` next-of-kin (`the relevant information`). The relevant information enabled DW2, who owned an undertaking business, to solicit business from the next-of-kin.
To establish their case, the prosecution relied heavily on two pre-trial statements (`the statements`) which the appellant had made to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). The first statement, made on 17 May 1999, was recorded by a CPIB investigating officer, PW4. In that statement, the appellant gave the following account of his dealings with DW2: sometime in August 1996, he had fallen into dire financial straits, and had asked an acquaintance, PW1, to introduce him to DW2 in order to borrow money from the latter. On their first meeting, DW2 lent him $1,000. DW2 also asked to be supplied with information as to the location, names and addresses of the deceased persons that the appellant transported in the police hearse, as well as the contact numbers and names of the deceased persons` next-of-kin. DW2 wanted to solicit business from the deceased persons` family members. The appellant agreed to this. On an average, he supplied DW2 with about two to three cases a week. He claimed that he had not received any commission for the arrangement. In January or February 1997, he borrowed another $2,000 from DW2, and subsequently a further $2,000 between July to September 1997. In addition, during the 1997 Chinese New Year period, he received a `red packet` of $200 from DW2. He supplied the relevant information to DW2 mainly because DW2 did not press him to repay the loans. As of the date of the statement, the loans remained unpaid.
A few days after making his first statement, the appellant attempted to retract that statement by making a statutory declaration which stated: 
 
On 17 May 1999 I made a statement to SSI Chin at CPIB Office (Rm 208). I was afraid and confused at that time and what I`ve said in that statement is not true. In fact I did not take any loan or other gifts from one Roland Tay. I also did not provide any information that will benefit him in his business.
 
 
 
About a month later, on 22 June 1999, the appellant made a second statement to CPIB. The investigating officer who recorded this second statement was PW5. In that second statement, the appellant gave a more detailed account of his dealings with DW2. He stated that he had first been introduced to DW2 by PW1 as early as August 1995. On that occasion, DW2 gave him $500, but said that he did not want to `discuss the details` with PW1 around. A few days later, DW2 contacted him and they met up. DW2 proposed that he would pay the appellant $600 a month in return for the relevant information. The appellant accepted this proposal and started giving DW2 the relevant information soon after this. Under this arrangement, he received sums of moneys from DW2 on 14 occasions ranging from $200 to $2,000 in the period between September 1995 and March 1997. In early September 1995, he received his first payment of $600. He gave details as to the places he recalled meeting DW2 to collect payments. He also gave details as to several dates which he could recall receiving money from DW2, and the amounts that he had received on each occasion. In addition, he referred to the `loans` which he had mentioned in his first statement, and stated that those sums of money were actually not `loans` at all, but payments from DW2 in February 1996 and September 1996 for the relevant information.
The prosecution called PW1 as a witness. PW1 had become acquainted with the appellant around 1995 in the course of his employment as a mortuary attendant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and as a part-time undertaker in a private undertaking company. He testified that sometime in 1995, the appellant was in financial trouble, and had asked him to approach moneylenders on his behalf. At the appellant`s request, he had pointed DW2 out on one occasion at a coffee shop. At the trial, PW1 denied that he had any knowledge of the dealings or arrangements which took place thereafter between the appellant and DW2. However, the prosecution successfully impeached his credit with a previous inconsistent statement, in which he had stated: 
 
It is true that Yusof had provided Roland Tay with information on location of dead body found or the address of the deceased family. I came to know this when I was working as a part-time undertaker for former boss Mr Ang of Tiong Aik Undertaker. ... When the police hearse was activated, I would follow the police hearse driven by Yusof to the scene. Sometimes I saw him making telephone calls after picking up the dead body. He told me that he was calling Roland Tay to provide him with the information so that his men could approach the decease family for business.
 
 
 
At the trial, the appellant denied all the charges against him. DW2 was called as a defence witness, and he also denied ever having extended monies to the appellant, or having received any of the relevant information from the appellant. The defence challenged the admissibility of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, on the basis that they had had been fabricated and had not been made voluntarily. They maintained that the truth was to be found in the appellant`s statutory declaration.
The district judge conducted a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of the statements. PW4 and PW5, the investigating officers who had recorded the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, gave evidence in the voir dire as to the circumstances in which those statements had been recorded. The district judge found no evidence to indicate that the making of the statements had been caused by a threat, inducement or promise. Consequently, he admitted them as evidence in the trial. At the end of the trial, having considered all the evidence before him, he found the appellant guilty of all 14 charges, and sentenced him accordingly.
 Issues in the appeal 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant raised four issues before me in the appeal. First, it was argued that the district judge should not have admitted into evidence the appellant`s two pre-trial statements, as these statements had not been given voluntarily; secondly, even if the statements were correctly admitted, the district judge had erred in his assessment of the inherent reliability and accuracy of the statements; thirdly, the district judge had erred in his assessment of the veracity and credibility of the witnesses; fourthly, even if the appellant had supplied the relevant information to DW2, that did not constitute `a showing of favour in relation to his principal`s affairs`, as was required under s 6(a) of the PCA.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The law on admissibility of statements made to non-police officers
 
I shall start with the admissibility of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements to the CPIB, since those statements contained evidence that was central to both the prosecution`s case, as well as the decision below. Notably, in this case, the statements had not been made to police officers but to CPIB officers. In addition, the CPIB officers in this case were investigating corruption offences under the PCA, and not Penal Code offences. Therefore, they were not `deemed to be police officers`, as the proviso in s 17 of the PCA was not applicable. Being a case where the statements were made by an accused person to non-police officers, s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CAP 68) (`CPC`) did not apply ( 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 150
 ; 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 ; 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 ). Instead, the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`) governed the admissibility of the statements. As the law stands, the appropriate test for determining admissibility of a statement, made by an accused person to a non-police officer, depends on whether that statement amounts to a confession or not.
If the statement amounts to a confession, that statement must satisfy s 24 of the EA before it is admissible as evidence in the trial. This section sets out what is commonly known as the `voluntariness test`. The same test is set out in s 122(5) of the CPC, in relation to statements made by an accused person to police officers.
Neither s 122(5) of the CPC, nor s 24 of the EA, apply to a statement not amounting to a confession, made by an accused to a non-police officer. There is, in fact, no statutory provision subjecting the admissibility of such a statement to the requirement of voluntariness: see 
Choo Pit Hong Peter v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 255
 . Thus, if such a statement is relevant, it would prima facie be admissible (see ss 5-16 of the EA). In general, the question of whether that statement was made voluntarily goes towards the weight to be attributed to it, rather than its admissibility. However, the court retains a residual discretion to exclude an illegally obtained statement if it is of the view that the prejudicial effect of that statement outweighs its probative value: 
 Choo Pit Hong Peter v PP 
. Strictly speaking, where a court is faced with a statement made by an accused person to a non-police officer, which is relevant and admissible, and the court is certain that the statement does not amount to a confession, a voir dire need not be conducted. In principle, the question of voluntariness of such a statement, going to its weight, can be determined in the course of the trial through examination-in-chief and cross-examination. However, as a matter of prudence and good practice, a court should still conduct voir dires to determine the voluntariness of such statements. The voir dire would assist the court in deciding whether or not to exercise its residual discretion to exclude the statement.
It is pertinent, at this point, to repeat the observations which I made in the recent case of 
PP v Heah Lian Khin
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 609
 . In that case, I was concerned with a similar situation, of statements made by a witness (as opposed to an accused person) to a CPIB officer investigating a non-Penal Code offence. The prosecution in that case sought to adduce previous inconsistent statements of a witness for the purpose of impeachment and cross-examination. The witness in question was not a mere witness but an accomplice who was not an accused person in those proceedings. Those statements, being statements made by a witness to a non-police officer, also fell outside the ambit of s 122 of the CPC and s 24 of the EA. I noted, per incuriam, that there were no statutory provisions which subjected the admissibility of a witness`s statement to the requirement of voluntariness. However, as was recognised in 
Cheng Swee Tiang v PP
 
 
[1964] MLJ 291
 , although a statement which has been unlawfully obtained from a witness is admissible if relevant, there is still a judicial discretion to disallow such evidence, if its reception would operate unfairly against an accused. Thus, I observed in 
 PP v Heah Lian Kin 
: 
 
 
84 ... To be consistent with [the] policy consideration [in Cheng Swee Tiang v PP], and as a prudent measure, the court will generally have to be satisfied as to its voluntary nature before it allows the admission of previous inconsistent statements of such witnesses. 
 
85 The practice of the courts in several previous cases has been to conduct voir dires to ascertain the voluntariness and admissibility of the witness`s statement: see 
Rajendran s/o Kurusamy & Ors v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 225
  at [para ] 103-110 and 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
  at [para ] 12-14. In the latter case, I described the voir dire as being a `preliminary examination by the judge to seek to discover if the witness is telling the truth`. The voluntariness of the witness statements was also a consideration in 
Tang Keng Boon v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 535
  and 
Tan Khee Koon v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
  at p 740. 
 
86 I fully recognise that there was no specific discussion in those cases, of the legal basis for the requirement of voluntariness, no apparent objection having been raised to the decision to convene a voir dire. In the ultimate analysis, however, I was not prepared, at this stage, to disturb what appeared to me to be an accepted practice in the absence of full arguments by parties.
  
 
 
These observations apply equally when the court is faced with a statement, made by an accused to a non-police officer, which does not amount to a confession.
 Whether the appellant`s pre-trial statements to CPIB officers amounted to `confessions` 
 
 
 
During the trial, neither the prosecution nor the defence counsel raised the issue of whether the pre-trial statements made by the appellant to CPIB officers, PW4 and PW5, amounted to confessions. They assumed that the voluntariness test applied in determining the admissibility of those statements. The district judge also proceeded on that assumption, and convened a voir dire. Whether the two statements amounted to confessions was an important question in their admissibility, and I will consider this issue first.
Section 17(1) of the EA states: 
 
An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned.
 
 
 
Section 17(2) of the EA states: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of any offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
The meaning to be attributed to the word `confession` was considered in the locus classicus case of 
Anandagoda v R
 
 [1962] MLJ 289 
[1962] 1 WLR 817
 where Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, stated: 
 
The term `admission` is the genus of which `confession` is the species. It is not every statement which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact which is a confession, but only a statement made by a person accused of an offence whereby he states that he committed that offence or which suggests not any inference but the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts ... It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession although the accused at the same time protests his innocence ... The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
 
 
 
The above dicta has been consistently applied in Singapore (see 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 ; 
 Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP 
, supra). In the case of 
PP v Abdul Rashid
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 794
  (cited with approval in 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 ), the court applied the 
 Anandagoda 
 test, and went further to observe as follows: 
 
... what s 17(2) [of the Evidence Act] purports to import, and what 
 Anandagoda
 purports to signify, is that a confession need not be an unqualified expression of guilt. Under our law, it is no more than a person`s statement admitting to his involvement in the offence charged in any manner or form. Be it minor or major, direct or indirect, explicit or inferential and whether in exculpation or in earnest, irrespective of its object, so long as the statement connects the accused in some way with the offence charged, it would be deemed a confession under s 17(2).
 
 
 
In the present case, the appellant faced charges under s 6(a) of the PCA, which states: 
 
If -
 
 
 
any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business;
 
 
 
he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
Applying the objective test enunciated in 
 Anandagon v R 
, each of the appellant`s two pre-trial statements would amount to a `confession` of the allegations against him only if it stated or suggested an inference that he had corruptly accepted gratification, as an inducement or reward for releasing the relevant information to DW2.
I found that the appellant`s first statement fell within the meaning of the word `confession`, for it contained an admission suggesting the inference that he had committed the offence for which he was charged. In that statement, he admitted that he had released the relevant information to DW2. He claimed that he had not received any commission for doing so, but admitted that he had taken several loans from DW2, and also that he had received a `red packet` of $200 from DW2 in February 1997. Moreover, he said that he had released the relevant information to DW2 mainly because DW2 had not chased him to repay the loans, and that those loans remained unpaid even at the date of the statement. The term `gratification`, as defined under s 2 of the PCA, includes the following: 
 
 
(a) money or any gift, loan, fee, reward, commission, valuable security or other property or interest in property of any description, whether movable or immovable; 
 
... 
 
(c) any payment, release, discharge or liquidation of any loan, obligation or other liability whatsoever, whether in whole or in part; 
 
...
  
 
 
Clearly, the benefits which the appellant admitted to having received from DW2 fell within the definition of `gratification` under the PCA. Notably, a reasonable man reading the statement on its own, without regard to extrinsic facts, would not say that the statement stated that the appellant was guilty, for that statement did not contain an admission of the requisite mens rea for an offence under s 6(a) of the PCA, which was corrupt intent. Nonetheless, the statement, taken as a whole without reference to extrinsic facts, still suggested the inference that he had corruptly received gratification from DW2 in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. In 
 Anandagoda 
`s case itself, where the appellant was charged with murder by running over the deceased with a motor car, his statements, considered by themselves, contained no admission that he was driving the car in question or that if he was driving it he ran over the deceased deliberately. Nonetheless, they were held to amount to a `confession` as they suggested the inference that he was guilty of the allegations against him.
I also had no doubt that the appellant`s second statement amounted to a `confession`. In that second statement, he admitted that he had released the relevant information to DW2 in return for money. He gave details as to some dates when he met DW2, and the sums of money which he had received from DW2, as well as some of the secret locations at which he had met DW2 to collect the money. From an objective point of view, the statement contained an inference that he had corruptly accepted gratification from DW2 in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. Clearly, it amounted to a confession.
Given my finding that both of the appellant`s statements amounted to `confessions`, it followed that s 24 of the EA applied to both statements. Under that section, the court must determine, first, whether the confession was made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise, and second, whether in making that confession, the accused did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself.
 Voluntariness of the appellant`s first pre-trial statement 
 
 
 
In relation to the first statement, the evidence led by the prosecution was as follows: the appellant had made the statement in the course of an interview with PW4 on 17 May 1999. PW4 commenced the interview with the appellant at 11.50am. At 12.50pm, they stopped for a 20 minute break. They resumed at 1.10pm and stopped again at 1.25pm. At 1.44pm, they started recording the statement and ended at 4.45pm. The appellant was served with lunch of Briyani rice and Coke at 2pm in the course of his statement being recorded.
According to the appellant, he was subjected to persistent questioning by PW4, and he had made the statement when he was `stressed and down`, just to please PW4. Based on this, the appellant`s counsel submitted before me that the appellant had been threatened and oppressed into making the first statement, and that the district judge should not have admitted it. I did not accept this submission. In my judgment, the interview conducted by PW4 was clearly not oppressive, either in its duration or its intensity. In coming to my conclusion, I was mindful of the principle that the test for voluntariness must be applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. A statement is considered to have been made involuntarily if there is objectively a threat, inducement or promise, and, if the threat, inducement or promise operates subjectively on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: 
Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
 ; 
Md Desa bin Hashim v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 MLJ 350
 ; 
 Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP 
, supra. In the present case, I found that the first statement was `voluntary` under the objective limb of the voluntariness test. There was no evidence that oppressive cross-examination techniques had been employed during the interview which took place on 17 May 1999. The only allegation was that the appellant had been subjected to PW4`s `persistent questioning in a rough voice`. However, the courts have consistently held that persistent questioning, or even robust interrogation, is necessary for the police process and does not, without more, amount to oppression ( 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 150
 ; 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 ; 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 ). The same can be said for investigations by CPIB. The first statement was also `voluntary` under the subjective limb of the voluntariness test. The appellant himself had served as a police officer for some 16 years. I agreed with the district judge that it was hardly probable that the appellant, being well-acquainted with the police process and police investigations, would have been oppressed or threatened by PW4`s persistent questioning into making an involuntary statement. The burden was on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily: 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
 . To do so, it was only necessary for the prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise. It was not necessary for the prosecution to remove every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 .
Counsel for the appellant also made much of the fact that the appellant had been given lunch one hour after the normal lunch hour, at 2pm, and `only after he had given favourable answers`. The suggestion made before me was that lunch had been withheld from the appellant for an hour, and then only given as a sort of `reward` for the favourable answers given by the appellant. I saw no merit in this submission. There was no evidence to suggest that lunch had been deliberately withheld until the appellant had given favourable answers. Whenever an allegation of this nature arises, the issue is whether a defendant was under such degree of discomfort as to have caused him to make an involuntary and unreliable statement (
 Panya Martmontree v PP 
, supra). In the present case, I had no doubt that the appellant was not under that extent of discomfort. The interview commenced at 11.55pm. Shortly after, at around 1.44pm, the appellant decided to provide information as to his activities and dealings with DW2. Between 11.55am and 1.44pm, the appellant had no less than two breaks from the questioning, one lasting 20 minutes and the other 15 minutes. Clearly, it had not taken much effort on the part of PW4 to get the appellant to co-operate. PW4 started recording the appellant`s statement at 1.44pm. At 2pm, the appellant was given lunch. This was clearly not a case where the accused was subjected to prolonged and intense interrogation, and was deliberately deprived of food and drink until he broke down and gave favourable answers to the investigating officers. Counsel for the appellant failed to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant`s first statement had been made voluntarily. I agreed with the district judge that, in relation to the first statement, the voluntariness test had been satisfied and that the statement was admissible as evidence in the trial.
 Voluntariness of the appellant`s second pre-trial statement 
 
 
 
As for the second statement, counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant had made it whilst labouring under an inducement or promise held out by the investigating officer, PW5, that he would not be prosecuted if he gave evidence against DW2. This allegation had already been denied by PW5 at the trial. PW5 maintained throughout his testimony and cross-examination that he had never given such an impression to the appellant, whether expressly or by implication. Instead, he had told the appellant several times that he was likely to be charged for corruption by CPIB.
Notably, the district judge found PW5 to be a truthful and reliable witness. Nonetheless, the appellant`s counsel argued before me that the appellant was induced to believe he would benefit when he saw PW5 in the period between making his first statement and his second statement. Apparently, the appellant had sought PW5 and repeatedly asked for some `assurance` from CPIB. In particular, he had gone to PW5`s office on 27 May 1999 and had asked PW5 for an assurance that he would not be charged for corruption if he were to stand as witness against DW2. PW5 testified that he had told the appellant that he would be charged, and it was not CPIB`s practice to give a written assurance to anyone. PW5 also told the appellant to get his counsel to write formally to PW5`s superiors in CPIB to make any representations. The following day, PW5 received a letter from the appellant (D2), which stated: 
 
 
1 With reference to my statement dated 17 May 1999 and my discussion with you on 26 May 1999 and 27 May 1999, I am willing to assist you further in your investigation into the affairs of one Roland Tay. 
 
2 As discuss with you, if you can assist me, from being prosecuted. If you can given me a letter saying that I will not be prosecuted for any offence in connection with this investigation, I am prepared to assist you as a witness.
  
 
 
The appellant`s counsel argues that the above exchange and letter indicated clearly that the appellant had been induced by PW5 to believe that he would benefit from making a statement, and therefore that the second statement had been made involuntarily. I did not accept this argument. First, considering the exchange that had taken place between the appellant and PW5 from an objective point of view, I found that PW5 had not held out any inducement or promise to the appellant. All that he did, was to tell the appellant to get his legal counsel to write formally to PW5`s superiors in CIPB. That was, at best, a neutral reply, and was too vague to amount to an inducement rendering the subsequent statement involuntary and unreliable. Notably, in 
Sim Cheng Yong v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 722
 , it was alleged that the police officer had told the accused that if the accused co-operated he would assist the accused. Even that was held to be too vague to amount objectively to `inducement`, because it was not specified in what way the police would assist the accused.
Secondly, the evidence indicated that at the time he made the second statement to CPIB, the appellant could not have held the subjective belief that he would benefit from making the statement. He had persistently sought some written assurance from CPIB that he would not be prosecuted if he gave evidence against DW2. He never received such written assurance. All he had been told, was to make formal written representations to PW5`s superiors in CPIB. Other than that, he had been told nothing else that could have amounted to an oral assurance. He wrote to PW5 on 28 May 1999, but received no reply. One month later, he gave his second statement. Even if he had previously held the subjective belief that he would benefit from making that statement, that belief was clearly non-existent at the time he made statement, for he stated in the statement itself that: 
 
I am now giving the following detailed statement concerning my involvement of corrupt practices with Roland Tay. It is also understood that I may be prosecuted for the offences committed by me.
 
 
 
The appellant did not dispute that he had read over the statement after it was recorded. He had signed and verified the truth of its contents. As such, I did not believe that he was labouring under any subjective belief, that he would benefit from making the statement.
Thus, having applied the objective and subjective limbs of the voluntariness test, I agreed with the district judge that the second statement was voluntarily made. In my judgment, the second statement was properly admitted as evidence in the trial.
 The weight accorded by the district judge to the pre-trial statements 
 
 
 
The next question was the weight which the district judge had accorded to the appellant`s pre-trial statements, and in particular, the second statement. Counsel for the appellant contended that even if the statements had been rightly admitted, the district judge was wrong to have based his findings of fact on the second statement. He pointed out to me that the appellant`s two pre-trial statements were inconsistent in material aspects, and that the appellant had also retracted his statements at the trial. In the light of this, he submitted that the district judge had erred in his assessment of the inherent reliability and accuracy of the second statement.
As a starting point, it is important to bear in mind that there are many reasons other than unreliability that makes an accused person retract his confession. Under the law, so long as the court is satisfied of its truth, a retracted confession can be relied upon for the truth of the facts stated therein. In fact, it is not necessary for a retracted confession to be corroborated before it can be relied upon: 
Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 SLR 232 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 180
 ; 
Mohamed Bachu Miah & Anor v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 249
 . Therefore, although the appellant had attempted to retract his statements at the trial, the district judge was entitled to rely upon the statements.
After assessing all the evidence before him, the district judge decided that the appellant`s second statement contained the true version of events, and should be accorded more weight than his other evidence. I fully agreed with him on this. In the first place, I did not see the two statements as being totally irreconcilable. In his first statement, the appellant said that he had only taken out loans from DW2, and that he had not received any commission in return for supplying DW2 with the relevant information. In his second statement, the appellant admitted that he did receive payment in return for releasing the relevant information to DW2. In that respect, the second statement could be said to be contradictory to the first statement. Other than that, however, the second statement merely clarified some inaccuracies in the first statement, and contained a more detailed account of the appellant`s dealings with DW2, which he had already admitted to in his first statement. In particular, the second statement contained details as to the amounts of money that he had received from DW2, as well as the dates and the locations of his meetings with DW2. Like the district judge, I was of the opinion that the second statement contained the true version of evidence. The appellant had neither reason nor motive to fabricate such an elaborate and meticulous story incriminating himself. Moreover, he had never repaid the so-called `loans` that he had mentioned in his first statement, and DW2 never pressed him for repayment of the same. These factors indicated strongly that he had not borrowed the moneys at all, but had in fact received those sums as payment for supplying the relevant information to DW2. Counsel for the appellant provided no explanation as to these issues. Thus, I saw no merit in their submission that the district judge was wrong when he ruled that the second statement contained the true version of evidence, and there was no reason for me to disturb the findings of fact that he made, based on the second statement.
 The district judge`s assessment of the veracity of the witnesses 
 
 
 
The third issue raised before me was that the district judge had erred in his assessment of the veracity of the witnesses. Counsel for the appellant argued that the district judge had wrongly impeached the credit of PW1. He also said that the district judge had no cogent reason to disbelieve the evidence given by appellant and DW2 during the trial. Furthermore, he submitted that the district judge had not given due regard to the evidence of a prosecution witness, PW3, which counsel for the appellant felt was favourable to the appellant. I will consider each complaint in turn.
 PW1`s veracity 
 
 
 
In relation to PW1, the district judge had ample grounds on which to impeach his credit. In PW1`s pre-trial statement to CPIB, he had stated that the appellant had told him personally that he was supplying DW2 with information on the location and address of dead bodies. Yet, in court, PW1 changed his testimony and disclaimed any knowledge of the dealings between the appellant and DW2. The learned judge referred to this material inconsistency in his written grounds, and he was entitled to impeach PW1`s credit.
 The appellant`s veracity 
 
 
 
Upon his two pre-trial statements being admitted, the appellant came face to face with the glaring inconsistencies and discrepancies in his own evidence. Initially, in his first statement to CPIB, he admitted that he had supplied DW2 with the relevant information, but denied having received any commission for the arrangement. He claimed that he had taken loans from DW2. A few days after making that statement, he made a statutory declaration retracting all that he had said previously in the first statement. Following this, he gave a second statement to CPIB, giving a detailed account of the occasions when he had received payment from DW2 in return for the information, as well as some of their meeting places and the amounts that he had received. He also admitted that the two so-called `loans` of $2,000 each ($4,000 in total) were in fact payments which he received in February 1996 and September 1996 for information that he had supplied to DW2. Finally, at the trial itself, he reverted to the stance in the statutory declaration, and denied everything. He had fluctuated between confessions and complete denials of the allegations against him - his credit was clearly called into question. Thus, the district judge had ample grounds to conclude that the appellant was an unreliable witness, and he was entitled to reject the appellant`s evidence in court.
 DW2`s veracity 
 
 
 
At the trial, DW2 stated that the appellant had never given him any specific addresses or names of the deceased persons, but had merely confirmed the locations of some of the dead bodies. He said that he had discovered the locations of those bodies from other sources, and after confirming the same with the appellant, he would go to the location and track down the next-of-kin through his own efforts. He also denied ever having extended monies to the appellant, whether by way of a loan or in payment for any information.
At the appeal, counsel for the appellant raised a procedural objection that the district judge had failed to make a clear ruling as to DW2`s credit at the trial. The prosecution had made an application under s 147 of the EA to impeach DW2`s credit. Following 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
  at p 604, the district judge should have made a ruling on the impeachment, if not at the end of the impeachment exercise, then at the close of the case together with the rest of the evidence tendered. Thus, the procedural objection raised by the appellant`s counsel was well-founded. Nevertheless, this procedural irregularity was a minor one, and it did not cause any prejudice to the appellant. Section 396 of the CPC states: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code; 
 
...
  
 
 
In addressing the question whether there was any failure or miscarriage of justice or whether a conviction was unsafe, the court will ask itself the subjective question of whether it was content to allow the verdict to stand, or whether there was some lurking doubt that an injustice had been done to the appellant: 
Tan Choon Huat v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 805
 . I had no doubt whatsoever that the procedural irregularity had not occasioned a failure of justice in the present case. As such, it was appropriate for me to overlook it.
 Evidence of PW3 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted before me that the district judge had erred, in that he had not given any consideration to the evidence of PW3. At the trial, PW3 testified as follows: her father had died at home on 21 March 1997 and that she had called the police. Two police officers came to her place, followed by two medical officers, then an inspector and a photographer. Shortly thereafter, two undertakers arrived, and then two more. She was unable to identify any of these persons at the trial, as they were all strangers to her and the incident had taken place so long ago. She had not been told how the undertakers had learnt of her father`s death so quickly. All she could establish, was that she had met her friend, one Sally Ho, at the mortuary the following day, and had learnt from Sally that two of the undertakers who had sought her out actually worked for Sally`s company. The link which the prosecution was trying to establish via PW3`s evidence was simply that at the relevant time, Sally Ho was helping DW2 in his undertaking business, and that they had received the requisite information pertaining to PW3`s father`s death and were able to quickly solicit PW3`s business. The allegation was that the appellant had been the police hearse driver in charge of transporting PW3`s father`s body, and that he had released the information pertaining to that police case to DW2. Beyond that, PW3`s evidence added nothing more to the case at hand. The fact that she could not identify the appellant was, in my judgment, neither favourable nor unfavourable to him. Consequently, the district judge had not erred in not alluding to PW3`s evidence in his written grounds. Her evidence was largely superfluous anyway.
 Whether the supply of the relevant information constituted a `showing of favour in relation to the principal`s affairs` 
 
 
 
The last issue raised in the appeal was that the prosecution had not shown an essential element of the charges against the appellant, namely that he had `shown favour in relation to his principal`s affairs`. To establish the charges against the appellant under s 6(a) of the PCA, the prosecution had to show (i) that there was an acceptance of gratification by the appellant, (ii) as an inducement or reward, (iii) that there was an objective corrupt element in the transaction, and (iv) that there was a subjective corrupt intent in the transaction in that the appellant had accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge ( 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 ; 
Tan Tze Chye v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 134
 ; 
PP v Har Su Meng
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 332
 ). Based on the findings of fact made by the district judge, the prosecution had clearly established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had accepted gratification from DW2 as a reward in return for releasing the relevant information to the latter. Counsel for the appellant argued before me that, even if the appellant had supplied the relevant information to DW2 for a monetary reward, this act did not constitute the `showing of favour` in relation to the Police Force`s affairs. He argued that this act had nothing to do with the appellant`s job as a police hearse driver, and that the appellant had not thereby compromised his official duties.
In effect, the point being canvassed by the appellant`s counsel, was that there had been no objectively corrupt element in the transaction. Whether a transaction is tainted with an objectively corrupt element is an inquiry based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man, keeping in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `corrupt` ( 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 [1997] 2 SLR 427 
). Each case turns on its own particular facts. Counsel for the appellant drew my attention to the case of 
PP v Low Tiong Choon
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 878
 . In that case, the accused, who was a police officer on duty at the Subordinate Courts, had introduced a client to a lawyer (who happened to be an ex-district judge), and had received $500 in return. The client he introduced was a person charged with drunk driving and whom he had met in the course of his duties. The district judge found that the accused`s conduct was clearly improper and in breach of the Police Code, and probably the subject of internal disciplinary action by the police. However she held that the conduct in question, although improper, did not constitute corruption. Her decision was upheld on appeal.
The case of 
 Low Tiong Choon 
 was clearly distinguishable from the present case on its facts. In the first place, that case involved a one-off incident. Secondly, it was the client who had approached the accused and asked the accused to help him by recommending a lawyer to him. There was no evidence to indicate that the accused had actively solicited clients for the lawyer. Moreover, it was found that the accused had not actually compromised the performance of his official police duties, for he had not shown either favour or disfavour to the client despite having introduced him to a lawyer. Thus, there was no objective corrupt element in the accused`s actions, although his conduct involved the potential for abuse of his position. In contrast, the facts of the present case were very different. This was not a case where a police officer committed a one-off incident of `harmless moonlighting`, by merely seizing an opportunity to make money that had come his way. Based on the findings of fact made by the district judge, the appellant had approached DW2 on his own accord, and specifically because he was in need of financial aid. He had released the relevant information to DW2 on no less than 14 occasions, over a period of about one and a half years. By accepting money from DW2, he had placed himself in a position beholden to DW2. The information was confidential, and the appellant knew this - he stated in the course of his cross-examination that he knew such information to be confidential. He had clearly abused his position and he knew it. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the prosecution had failed to adduce any documentary evidence, in the form of internal rules or Police Standing Orders, to support their allegation that the relevant information was confidential. Notably, the district judge had believed the evidence of PW2, who was the officer-in- charge of the Patrol Unit attached to Tanglin Police Division. PW2 testified that the information received by hearse drivers in the course of their duty, such as the names and addresses and locations of the deceased persons and the contact numbers and names of the next-of-kin, was all confidential information, and was not to be disclosed unless clearance from superiors had been obtained. He had no reason to lie on oath and his evidence was not challenged by the defence counsel at the trial. In any event, the appellant had himself admitted in the course of his cross-examination that he knew such information to be confidential. In the light of this, it was not open for the appellant`s counsel to say at the appeal that the relevant information was not confidential, or indeed, that the appellant had not been aware that he was releasing confidential information.
In the case of 
Mohamed Ali bin Mohamed Iqbal v PP
 
 SLR 447 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 58
 , the appellant, who was an Immigration Officer attached to the Singapore Airport, was charged and convicted for offences under s 6(a) of the PCA. As an Immigration Officer, his duties included the checking of incoming passengers` passports and their Disembarkation Forms. In return for a fee, he supplied two lists containing confidential information about the name, place of stay and duration of stay of incoming passengers to a sales promotion officer employed by a shopping centre. At the appeal, the argument was that the appellant`s acts, namely, copying the information contained in the Disembarkation Forms and passing the information to a third party who had no dealings with the appellant`s principal, the Government, could not amount to acts done by the appellant in relation to his principal`s affairs. It was argued that what the appellant did was something wholly outside the affairs or business of his principal, and that accordingly he had been wrongly convicted under s 6(a) of the PCA. This argument was rejected as being unsound, and his appeal dismissed. The former Chief Justice, Wee Chong Jin, pointed out in his written judgment that the words `in relation to his principal`s affairs` fell to be widely construed, and for a conviction under s 6(a) of the PCA, it need not be proved that the acts done by a person were done by him as an agent on behalf of his principal. He stated that the conditions precedent to an offence under that section was proof, inter alia, that the person charged was an agent as defined and what he did was in relation to his principal`s affairs or business. Reverting to the case before me, I found that the appellant fell squarely within the meaning of the word `agent`, which is defined in s 2 of the PCA to mean any person employed by or acting for another, including, inter alia, a person serving the Government or under any public body. The appellant`s act of releasing confidential information obtained in the course of his official duties were clearly acts which were in relation to the Police Force`s affairs. I also found that the appellant had clearly shown favour to DW2 - by releasing the relevant information in police cases to DW2, he was in effect supplying DW2 with a constant flow of clients (ie the family members of deceased persons in police cases) in return for a fee.
As a police officer, the appellant`s duties were part of the whole police process. The nature of police work, especially cases involving deceased persons, is extremely sensitive, and there is great public interest in ensuring that the information pertaining to the deceased persons should remain confidential until such time as the police deems fit to release the information into the public domain. I had no doubt that the appellant had compromised his duties as a police officer. By his conduct of trading confidential information for a fee, he enabled the undertakers to rapidly descend on the scene of the police case, and this was surely detrimental to the police`s efforts to carry out their tasks. For example, in the case of PW3`s father`s death, it had apparently taken only an hour for the undertakers to arrive at PW3`s home, and according to PW3, the undertakers had arrived at the scene when the police were still around. The appellant`s conduct undermined the investigative system of the Police Force. Without question, this was a case that went beyond mere internal police disciplinary action for improper conduct. Criminal sanction was warranted. Thus, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
Under s 6(a) of the PCA, the appellant could have been imprisoned for a term of up to five years, or fined up to $100,000, or both. The district judge sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment on each of the 14 charges, with only the first two sentences running consecutively.
I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against sentence, as the sentence passed by the district judge was not manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Indeed, there were aggravating factors in this case, which justified the term of 18 months` imprisonment that he had received. First, his culpability was exacerbated by the fact that he was a law enforcement officer. Secondly, he had released information which he himself knew to be confidential, and which he had obtained in the course of public duty, and which related directly to his official duties as a police hearse driver. Thirdly, he had committed the offences over a lengthy period of time, spanning some one and a half years. He had ceased to continue committing the offence, not out of a realisation of guilt, but because he had been promoted to the rank of Police Sergeant and was no longer the designated police hearse driver privy to the relevant information. Fourthly, the amount of gratification involved was alleged to be in the range of about $10,900. This was a substantial amount. This sum was not actually proved concretely by the prosecution, but it was based on the appellant`s own admissions in his second pre-trial statement to CPIB. In view of these factors, an adequate term of imprisonment must be passed in order to deter other police officers from acts of the same nature.

Whether first or second vessel more responsible for damage caused
 
(delivering the grounds of decision of the court): The respondents, as owners of the cables, claimed damages from the owners of the Teng He which was at the relevant time in the same ownership as the Tai He, arising out of and in connection with the damage done by the Tai He when she severed submerged cables towed by the respondents` vessel Nordic Explorer in the Bo Hai Gulf, on 18 September 1998 at approximately 1605 hours.
In a judgment delivered on 31 March 2000, GP Selvam J held that the appellants were liable for 60% of the damage claimed, while the respondents were liable for the remaining 40%. [See 
[2000] 3 SLR 114
.] The appellants appealed. Before us, they argued that their liability should be nil, or, at the very least, reduced to account for the respondents` negligence in failing to keep proper watch or give due warning of the submerged seismic cables. It was their case that the respondents` conduct or failure to act constituted the greater cause for the damage.
 Background to the case 
 
 
 
The undisputed facts are that at the material time, the respondents were carrying out seismic survey activities in the Bo Hai Gulf. Their survey vessel, the Nordic Explorer measured 81.8 metres. It proceeded at a speed of 4 to 4.5 knots and towed seven underwater seismic cables of up to 4,235 metres in length each. Numerous sensors, referred to as `birds`, were positioned at intervals along the cables to pick up seismic responses to an energy source emitted by the Nordic Explorer. Attached to the end of each cable was an orange coloured tail buoy floating 1.6 metres above water. Each tail buoy was fitted with a radar reflector and a Global Positioning System beacon. The undisputed evidence was that the Nordic Explorer could dive its seismic cables to a depth of nine metres in 30 seconds, and about 17 metres in three minutes. It was also equipped with six chase boats to protect and chase away any on-coming vessel in the vicinity of the Nordic Explorer and its seismic cables.
At the material time, however, its main chase boat and the only one with ARPA (an automatic route-plotting radar facility) was re-fuelling and not in the immediate area. The Nordic Explorer made its way on the course of 132 degrees at latitude 38 degrees 34.15 minutes North and longitude 120 degrees 21.61 minutes East.
Meanwhile, the appellants` vessel Tai He proceeded along a course of about 100 degrees from Xingang to Dalian at about 14 to 15 knots. Although the crew of the Tai He varied from this route to steer clear of the tail buoys and their positions on radar, such a variation placed her on a collision course with the seismic cables towed by the Nordic Explorer. At 1538, the Nordic Explorer dived their cables to avoid collision with another vessel in the vicinity (referred to in the proceedings as `the Korean vessel`). It had sent chase boats, fired flares and sent securite messages to warn the Korean vessel of its underwater towage, but without success. Hence the decision to dive the cables at 1538. They resumed operating depth at 1556. Minutes later, at 1606 hours, the Tai He steamed across and severed all seven seismic cables towed by the Nordic Explorer.
Those on board the Tai He were unaware of this damaging contact. It was seven days later, while the Tai He was docked in Kobe, Japan, that the respondents` representative went on board the Tai He to conduct their investigations. Consequently, the respondents brought this action against the appellants for the damage caused to the seismic cables. They alleged that those on board the Tai He had failed to respond to the many warning signals sent out by the Nordic Explorer. These included the firing of flares, securite messages and the chase boats deployed to ward off vessels in the area. The respondents asserted that those on board the Nordic Explorer were preoccupied with a `ghost vessel`. Their case was also that the damage would not have occurred had the Tai He kept to its original course of 94 degrees. They had observed that the Tai He had kept a course of 94 degrees between 1553 and 1602 hours and therefore did not consider the Tai He a threat. However, at 1602 hours, the Tai He abruptly turned some ten degrees to port, putting it on a collision course with the submerged cables.
Indeed, the Tai He had altered her course to avoid the tail buoys that appeared on the radar as a cluster of targets. It was the appellants` case that at around 1554 hours, the Chief Officer ordered the helm put 15 degrees to starboard. At about 1602 hours, the Chief Officer observed on the ARPA that the Tai He had passed a small target on her port side at a distance of about one to 1.5 miles, such distance narrowing at 1605 hours to less than one mile from the cluster of targets. Shortly after passing these targets, the Chief Officer reverted the course of the Tai He to the original 94 degrees.
 Decision below 
 
 
 
The learned judge made the following findings of fact. Firstly, despite the repeated firing of green flares to warn the Tai He and the pursuit of chase boat No 201 using red flares and a loudspeaker to warn the Tai He of the seismic cables ahead, the crew on board the Tai He neglected and/or failed to respond. By ignoring these repeated warnings, the crew was negligent in their navigation and/or management of the Tai He.
Next, the learned judge dealt at length with the inconsistencies between the appellants` pleaded defence and the evidence adduced at trial. He viewed this as discrediting the Chief Officer of the Tai He. He took this witness to task for failing to accurately chart the positions of the tail buoys in relation to the Tai He when made to do so in exh P4. The learned judge relied on exh P3, a chart drawn up by experts at his direction, to demonstrate the witness`s unreliability. The learned judge found that the Chief Officer was not aware of the presence of any tail buoys or fishing vessels in the vicinity.
The learned judge affirmed the respondents` evidence that there was a Korean vessel which approached the Nordic Explorer`s community of vessels from her port side. That vessel first altered course to starboard and then to port and passed astern of the seven tail buoys. In this instance, he found that the respondents had dived their seismic cables to a depth of 17 metres as a precautionary measure.
After restating several fundamental rules of safe navigation, the learned judge found that the appellants` servants were `incompetent and indiligent`. They had proceeded at a reckless speed, blind to the presence of the cables, buoys and chase boats. He found no basis for the appellants to assume that the moving buoys were not under tow. In such circumstances, they should not have cut across in front of the moving buoys. They were indifferent to the respondents` securite broadcasts by VHF on Channel 16. They were blind to the flares fired by the respondents` vessel. They would have no such difficulty if they had maintained an efficient radar and visual outlook. On a balance of probabilities, he found the only rational explanation for the Chief Officer`s navigation was not to avoid the `clustered fishing vessels` but to respond to the Korean vessel`s movements. Reading all these findings together, he found that if the Tai He had reduced its speed and maintained a better radar, visual and auditory watch, the fact that the buoys were being towed would have been appreciated and the collision would have been averted.
As for the respondents, the learned judge found that they had made the requisite broadcasts and fired warning flares. At the crucial moment, they had just managed to divert the Korean vessel. The earliest time they could have realised that the Tai He was a threat was shortly after 1555 when the Tai He altered course to starboard. He accepted that at that point in time, those on board the Nordic Explorer were distracted by a `ghost` on the starboard bow on their radar. It was in this `moment of agony` that the Tai He approached them at a breakneck speed of 17.5 knots in restricted visibility. In this state of confusion, the Tai He escaped from the scene without the knowledge of the Nordic Explorer crew. In these circumstances, the learned judge accepted that those on board the Nordic Explorer should have developed a knee jerk reaction of diving the cables. They had done so moments earlier to avoid the Korean vessel. The learned judge ruled that their failure to do so contributed to 40% of the damage with the appellants liable for the remaining 60%.
 Case on appeal 
 
 
 
The appellants premised their case on causation. They contended that the acts or omissions of the respondents had a direct causative effect on the Tai He`s contact with the cables and that, but for these acts and omissions, the contact would not have occurred. The main issue was one of knowledge as this was key to determining how the damage could have been avoided. On the present facts, there was nothing to indicate to the Tai He that there were submerged seismic cables in the vicinity. Those on board the Tai He had fulfilled their duty of care to navigate in relation to apparent objects.
Instead, given the respondents` own knowledge of their activities and capabilities, it was reasonable to expect the respondents to discharge a duty of care of alerting other vessels to the presence of their submerged cables. They argued that the respondents should bear the greater liability for the damage because of their critical failure to safeguard the unusual nature of their vessel`s activity.
Firstly, the respondents neglected to send out adequate navigational warnings, whether by Navtext or by publication in the Notices to Mariners for seismic survey activities in China. Such measures had been taken with regard to the exploration activities of another survey vessel, the `Jinxing No. 2`, on 15 September 2000. They gave evidence that the respondents themselves had provided detailed notices with a previous survey operation involving another vessel, the Master Odin. Their failure to do so in the case of the Nordic Explorer was highly negligent given the lengthy three month survey period carried out over a large heavily trafficked zone with highly sensitive submerged equipment.
The Tai He was not equipped to receive the Morse Code warnings sent out by the Nordic Explorer. Although the latter party had later relied on manual distribution of notices to the fishing community, this was only after the Tai He had left port. Such failure placed a heavier duty on the respondents to take extra careful measures while carrying out their operations. Therefore they could not avail themselves of the excuse that those on board the Tai He should have been aware of seismic activities in the Bo Hai Gulf at the material time since they were not given any notice. The appellants also brought the court`s attention to the respondents` admission that they had intended to publish these warnings but that their agents had failed to do so. Furthermore, the respondents had failed to rectify this throughout the period the Nordic Explorer was at sea.
The respondents` other means of issuing navigational warnings was via VHF. Appellants` counsel argued that clarity of transmission was like that between walkie-talkies, with Channel 16 being the sole channel used by all ships in the vicinity. It was submitted that, according to the respondents` Incident Report, one of their own chase boats had encountered difficulty using VHF in communicating with the Nordic Explorer. In the circumstances, the respondents could not reasonably expect their warnings via VHF to suffice. Whereas the Tai He was travelling in accordance with the Chinese Ministry of Transport`s Traffic Separation Scheme, by contrast the Nordic Explorer had not taken sufficient preventive measures to make their four-kilometre presence publicly known. It was contended that the learned judge had failed to consider the lack of public notification even though it was reasonably foreseeable that, along with the Tai He, other vessels were entitled to be in the area.
Next, the appellants argued that the Nordic Explorer crew failed to keep an adequate lookout. At the material time, the lead chase boat was absent. The three lead co-ordinators were transferred to other chase boats and not to the main vessel. This led to poor co-ordination of chase activities and culminated in the resulting failure to warn the Tai He. In fact, the six chase boats had been directed to divert the Korean and `ghost` vessels since they were in front. Counsel for the appellants attributed this failure to keep a proper lookout to at least one other handicap experienced by the Nordic Explorer. Its helipad created a `dead zone` 20 degrees to starboard and 20 degrees to port. The Tai He`s approach fell completely within this dead zone. Hence those on board the Nordic Explorer were unaware of the oncoming Tai He until after cables were severed. The respondents` own Incident Report had addressed this problem and recommended that the dead zone be rectified. The learned judge did not address this `dead zone` problem and the consequent failure of the Nordic Explorer crew to spot the 236 metre long Tai He. The Nordic Explorer chase boats may have been active in the area but they were never specifically deployed to counter the Tai He. This much was admitted by the respondents in their submissions on appeal. Their attention was on the `ghost vessel`. The appellants submitted that the respondents` ghost vessel could now properly be identified as the indirect radar echo of the Tai He.
The appellants argued that, in any case, the simplest and most effective response, whether to a real or surreal vessel, would have been to dive the cables. It was undisputed that the cables could be dived to a depth of nine metres in 30 seconds, and a further eight metres in three minutes. Counsel for the appellants submitted that this would have been far more effective than the respondents` postulation that the Tai He could have prevented the damage by turning hard to starboard at 1604 hours. It was submitted that such response could not have been taken in time. The cables were severed 400 metres from the stem and coupled with the fact that the Tai He had a stopping distance of 2.4 nautical miles this showed that, apart from diving the cables, it was a matter of time that the Tai He would cut across the path of the submerged cables.
The respondents` case centred on the unreasonable speed of the Tai He in conditions of such poor visibility. The Tai He was proceeding at top speed of 17.5 knots where visibility was one nautical mile. Given that its stopping distance was 2.4 nautical miles, this speed was reckless. It affected the crew`s judgment and hampered its ability to react in time. The respondents contended that, in their haste, the Tai He crew failed to observe the tow lights on the Nordic Explorer and to accurately assess the powerful cyclops radar reflectors as belonging to tail buoys with underwater towage. The respondents dismissed their failure to give reasonable notice of their seismic exploration activities as `not reasonably practicable` in all the circumstances.
 Decision on appeal 
 
 
 
This was an appeal against findings of fact that carried much weight in the apportionment of liability. It is a settled principle of law that the appellate court is entitled to reverse decisions where, upon a careful study of all the evidence, a different conclusion is arrived at, on the facts. We were of the view that the present case merited a reversal on the apportionment of liability for the following reasons.
A preliminary observation may be made with regard to the need for official notification of a vessel`s seismic activities. We accept that a party has a duty of giving notice by whatever relevant form reasonable and practicable as is the common trade or practice of the area. In the present case, our view was that the failure to do so, although contributory, was not directly causative of the damage.
It was undisputed in the court below that not only were frequencies erratically jammed, but its use was ineffective in countering the approach of other vessels. Just moments before the incident, the Nordic Explorer had dived its cables to at least 15 metres to avoid the oncoming Korean vessel. As noted by the learned judge himself, this should have taught those on board the Nordic Explorer to develop a knee jerk reaction to dive the cables. We found that this was a critical failure on the part of those on board the Nordic Explorer. This failure was the result of several negligent acts or omissions which we now turn to discuss.
We accepted the appellants` case that the contact would have been prevented, had the chase boats been deployed in time and adequately equipped to warn the Tai He of the submerged cables. Although the learned judge criticised the Tai He for not visually sighting the 3 metre-long tail buoys, he did not adequately address the failure of the Nordic Explorer to deal with the approaching Tai He. Instead, he took those on board the Tai He to task for failing to notice the chase boats, flares and warning messages. We found this to be unduly harsh since the respondents had admitted that no flares or chase boats were specifically deployed to warn the Tai He of the submerged cables in the immediate vicinity. There was never any evidence that the Nordic Explorer crew were themselves alert to the presence of the Tai He. The testimony of the translator on board the Nordic Explorer testified that those on board the Nordic Explorer were unaware of the Tai He until after the contact had occurred. We were not impressed with the respondents` initial allegations that the Tai He had ignored warnings sent out by the Nordic Explorer to them. The respondents` excuse was that the master of one of their chase boats involved in chasing the Tai He was `mysteriously taken ill` at the time of the trial and they were consequently unable to adduce his evidence in court. They maintained that their final case was complementary to these initial allegations. This was a weak argument. In fact, at paragraph 129 of their case, the respondents asserted that `while the flares were fired without knowledge of the Tai He`s presence per se, the continual firing of flares ought to have put the Tai He on notice that there was an immediate danger ahead.` They also admitted that the sound signal was not specifically directed at the Tai He. This removed much of the basis for the learned judge`s finding that the Tai He crew was negligent, since his grounds extensively discussed their failure to respond to the VHF warnings addressed to them and the green flares fired at the Tai He by the Nordic Explorer.
None of the warnings were specifically addressed to the Tai He. Instead, as the respondents alleged, the appellants were negligent purely on the basis of failing to keep proper watch and due speed in conditions of poor visibility. Such an allegation was not sufficient to warrant a 60% blame in the circumstances of this case. The court below accepted the visibility conditions to be poor at the material time. It cannot then be reasonable to expect the Tai He to sight flares that burn for approximately 40 seconds in such poor visibility. There was also no evidence to suggest that these flares were fired after the Korean vessel had safely navigated past the seismic vessel and its cables. Instead the overwhelming evidence was that these flares were fired in that heightened state of avoidance activity between 1539 until the cables were raised again at 1555.
Not only did the learned judge fail to address the inadequate lookout of the Nordic Explorer, he accepted that a `ghost` vessel distracted those navigating the Nordic Explorer at 1602 hours. The respondents built much of their case on the `consternation on the bridge of the Nordic Explorer at this moment`, claiming that those on board were restricted in their ability to manoeuvre and take avoidance action. With respect, we were unable to agree with the learned judge`s generous acceptance of evidence of this nature. Instead, we found greater weight should have been placed on other findings of negligence. For example, the respondents` First Officer admitted that he had spotted a radar target at 1549. This radar target proved to be the Tai He. Clearly, but for his failure to respond promptly (in this case, to dive the cables), the crossing of the Tai He would have been without incident.
In our view, all these inadequacies amplified the glaring failure of those on board the Nordic Explorer to dive the cables as they had done so just nine minutes prior to the incident. The respondents` failure to save the situation despite their instant ability to do so was critical. We were referred to the Nordic Explorer log that recorded the diving of seismic cables between 8 September 2000 until 27 September 2000 (the Nordic Explorer installed replacements on 27 September 2000). This log demonstrated no hesitation on the part of the respondents to employ their diving capabilities to avoid vessels crossing over the seismic cables. It was not difficult to find that their failure to do so was a direct cause for the damage. Taking this argument one step further, if the Nordic Explorer had dived its cables in time, only then would it be easier to conclude that they should not shoulder greater liability for the resulting damage.
Having dealt at length with the negligence of those on board the Nordic Explorer, we also found the appellants contributorily negligent. Much of this was sufficiently dealt with in the decision below. The appellants` negligence largely centred on their speed, inadequate lookout and poor management of equipment. As was the evidence before the court, it would not have made much difference had the Tai He been proceeding more slowly. The Tai He had navigated to avoid all navigational hazards that were apparent. These may have included the Korean vessel and the tail buoys, but it could not reasonably be expected to avoid hazards that were not brought to its attention such as the submerged seismic cables.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
We found that the respondents` negligence, in particular, the failure to dive the cables even 30 seconds before the incident and hence, the ineffective responses that preceded it, carried a greater causative weight on the damage suffered. The appeal was allowed. The respondents were liable for 60% of the damage and the appellants for 40% of the damage.

: The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to a total of seven offences, which comprised one count of robbery with hurt pursuant to s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), one count of possession of an offensive weapon pursuant to s 6 of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65), four counts connected with the sale of uncensored and obscene video compact discs (`VCDs`), which were brought variously under the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Ed), and one count of publicly exhibiting obscene VCD covers pursuant to s 292(a) of the Penal Code. The district judge sentenced the appellant to a total of seven years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. Subsequent to his conviction and sentencing, the Public Prosecutor brought an application for criminal revision pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), seeking the substitution of amended charges for two of the Films Act offences. At the same time, the appellant appealed against his sentence, contending that it was excessive and pleading for leniency. I granted the application for criminal revision and dismissed the appeal against sentence, and now give my reasons.
 The application to amend the charges 
 
 
 
The first charge, for which the Public Prosecutor sought amendment, concerned s 29(3) of the Films Act, and charged that the appellant: 
 
... did have in [his] possession for the purposes of attempting to distribute 35 (thirty-five) video compact discs containing 35 (thirty-five) films, knowingly or having reasonable cause to believe that the film [sic] to be obscene ...
 
 
 
This charge was erroneously worded, as the offence of possessing obscene films for the purposes of attempting to distribute them does not exist. As such, the Public Prosecutor applied for criminal revision pursuant to s 268 of the CPC, and requested that I exercise my powers under s 256 of the CPC to amend the relevant portion of the charge to read: 
 
... did have in your possession for the purpose of distribution 35 (thirty-five) video compact discs containing 35 obscene films, having reasonable cause to believe the films to be obscene ...
 
 
 
and to convict the appellant on the amended charge.
The second charge had been brought under s 6(1)(a) of the Films Act, and charged that the appellant: 
 
... did carry on a business of attempting to distribute 113 video compact discs containing 74 films, without a valid licence ...
 
 
 
Again, the charge was flawed in that the offence in question was non-existent. The Public Prosecutor sought to replace the relevant portion with the following: 
 
... did carry on the business of distributing video CDs containing films, without a valid licence ...
 
 
 
Before me, the appellant raised no objection to the proposed amendments.
 The law on amendment of charges 
 
 
 
Section 268 of the CPC provides that the High Court may, in an application for criminal revision, exercise, inter alia, its powers under s 256 of the CPC. Section 256 in turn grants to the High Court wide powers in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. That such powers include the power to amend a charge and consequently convict an accused person on the amended charge was conclusively established by the Court of Appeal in 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
 . This power has since been exercised on several occasions, most recently in cases such as

[2001] 3 SLR 313
  and 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
 .
The exercise of the power to amend is, however, subject to certain restrictions. In 
 Garmaz s/o Pakhar 
 (supra at p 410), the Court of Appeal noted with approval the following passage from the Malaysian case of 
Sivalingam v PP
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
  at 174 per Abdul Hamid FJ: 
 
The requirement of ss 166 and 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code must be satisfied before a High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction alters or substitutes a conviction for a different offence. Although therefore an appellate court is possessed of the power which it can lawfully exercise, it is equally essential that such power be exercised within the confines of the law. The question is to what extent and under what circumstances such power can be invoked. What is clear in our minds is, and we emphasise, that such power must be exercised under limited circumstances and with great caution subject to the restriction imposed by s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and it must be done so as not to prejudice the case of an accused.
 
 
 
In 
PP v Koon Seng Construction
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 , I stated, in the context of an amendment to a charge on which the accused had pleaded guilty (at p 579): 
 
The power of amendment is clearly not unfettered. It should be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against prejudice to the defence ... The court must be satisfied that the proceedings below would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded would have been the same. The primary consideration is that the amendment will not cause any injustice, or affect the presentation of the evidence, in particular, the accused`s defence. These safeguards must be rigorously observed.
 
 
 
 
 
 Application to the present case 
 
 
 
 
 
In 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 , I laid out certain guidelines relating to the exercise of the High Court`s revisionary jurisdiction, viz (at p 330): 
 
... various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 
 
 
The present situation was clearly a proper case for the exercise of the revisionary power, in that the appellant had been convicted and sentenced for non-existent offences. However, I also had to consider whether the proper course for me to take was to amend the charges as requested by the Public Prosecutor, and thereafter convict the appellant on them. I was mindful that the cases in which the High Court exercised its power to amend charges largely related to situations where the charge was defective in that it did not disclose the commission of an offence, eg in 
Ong Tiong Poh v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 853
 , or where a new offence, made out on the facts, was substituted for an offence which was not made out on the facts, as in 
 Loo Weng Fatt 
 (supra). The situation before me, on the other hand, concerned the appellant pleading guilty to non-existent offences, and it was necessary to determine whether the High Court`s powers of amendment extended to such situations.
In 
 Koon Seng Construction 
 (supra), I approved the exercise of the power of amendment in a situation where the accused person, due to a clerical error, pleaded guilty to an offence different from that which both prosecution and defence had intended to proceed under. In making my decision, I took the view that such situations were analogous to those where the High Court substitutes the charge and convicts the accused on the substituted charge. As I noted then (at p 579): 
 
Substituting a charge necessarily involves amending the charge to introduce different terms. Whether the amendment introduces an entirely different offence section or not, a new and different charge is in place. The necessity to observe the safeguards against prejudice operates to ensure that the substituted charge does not stray beyond the limits imposed by ss 173 to 175 CPC. In other words, an amendment to introduce a substituted charge should be no different in effect from a substituted conviction.
 
 
 
Following from the above, I had no hesitation in deciding that the power of amendment extended to the present situation. In any event, it was patently clear to me that the defects in the charges in question arose from a failure to conform the wording in the charges to the wording of the statute. As such, apart from viewing this particular application to amend the charge as analogous to a substituted conviction, I was also of the view that it was analogous to those situations where the charge failed to disclose the necessary elements of the offence. Finally, I took note of the decision in the Malaysian case of 
Siah Ik Kow v PP
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 217
 , in which the court amended the original charge, which referred to a non-existent offence, and substituted the correct offence.
Having decided that the present case was a proper one for the exercise of the power of amendment, I considered whether the exercise would cause the appellant any injustice. I concluded that it would not. Apart from the fact that the appellant, when given the opportunity to object to the proposed amendments, stated that he had no such objections, I was also satisfied that the course of the proceedings in the court below would not have taken a different turn had the charges been correctly drawn up in the first place. The two offences to which the charges related were clearly made out on the facts, the appellant having been caught red-handed. They were also complete offences, such that there had been no need to charge the appellant with attempt in the first place. Furthermore, I was mindful that the appellant had also pleaded guilty to a second, correctly worded charge, relating to a separate incident, which had also been brought under s 29(3) of the Films Act.
Finally, I was satisfied that the appellant would not be prejudiced in terms of his sentence if I granted the application. The appellant had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from one month`s to six months` imprisonment for the four Films Act offences and the one related charge brought under the Penal Code of exhibiting obscene VCD covers. These sentences were ordered to run concurrently, such that the appellant only faced six months` imprisonment for all five offences. Of the two defective charges, the appellant was sentenced on the one brought under s 6(1)(a) of the Films Act to three months` imprisonment, such that the punishment for that offence would have been subsumed under the term of six months` imprisonment. As to the charge brought under s 29(3) of the Films Act, although the appellant was sentenced on it to six months` imprisonment, the appellant had also been sentenced to six months` imprisonment on the second, correctly worded charge under s 29(3). As such, the cumulative term of six months` imprisonment which the appellant received for the five VCD-related offences was not attributable solely to the defective charge brought under s 29(3).
In light of the foregoing, I granted the application for criminal revision, amended the two defective charges, and duly convicted the appellant on them.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The only grounds cited by the appellant for his appeal against sentence were a plea for leniency and the contention that the sentence was too heavy. In respect of the plea for leniency, I had little hesitation in dismissing it. Taking into account the appellant`s numerous criminal antecedents and the serious nature of the charges he was sentenced for in the court below, I concluded that it was not appropriate for me to exercise leniency in the present case.
As for the contention that the sentence was too heavy, I noted that the sentence of seven years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane had been imposed in respect of seven offences. The bulk of the sentences was accounted for by the conviction for robbery with hurt, for which the appellant was sentenced to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The conviction for possession of an offensive weapon accounted for the remaining six strokes of the cane, and six months` imprisonment. The remaining six months` imprisonment related to four Films Act offences and the conviction for exhibiting obscene VCD covers, for which, as noted above, the appellant had been given varying sentences of one month`s to six months` imprisonment.
I found no cause for complaint in the individual sentences imposed. The minimum mandatory sentence for robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code is five years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. As for possession of an offensive weapon, the sentence of six months` imprisonment was well below the maximum sentence of three years` imprisonment, and the six strokes of the cane were mandatory. Finally, as to the five offences relating to the VCDs, the sentence was clearly not manifestly excessive as, individually, they fell far short of the maximum term for these offences 
 and 
 the district judge allowed them to all run concurrently.
Neither did I find that the total sentence of seven years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane to be manifestly excessive. As I had already noted, the bulk of the sentences was taken up by the sentence for robbery with hurt. I found that the additional one year`s imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was reasonable considering that it was meant to account for the remaining six offences, and was not in any way manifestly excessive.
As such, I dismissed the appeal against sentence.

: This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against sentence passed by District Judge Khoo Oon Soo.
The respondent pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon under s 326 Penal Code (Cap 224) and of drug consumption under s 8(b)(i) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) with the enhanced punishment prescribed in s 33(3) of the same Act. He was sentenced to three years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on the s 326 Penal Code charge and four years` imprisonment on the drug consumption charge. Both sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making a total of seven years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
At the close of the appeal, I set aside the sentences of imprisonment and sentenced the respondent to preventive detention for a period of ten years. I did not vary the district judge`s orders in relation to the six strokes of the cane on the charge under s 326 of the Penal Code. I now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Charge under s 326 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
According to the statement of facts which was admitted without qualification, the respondent was drinking with the victim and two other friends at a coffeeshop at the material time. When the victim stood up to leave, the respondent suddenly slashed his face, using a paper cutter with a blade measuring about 10 cm in length. He continued slashing the victim on the face until the latter dropped to the ground. The respondent then walked away from the scene. The police later conducted a search and detained the respondent in the vicinity of the attack. A paper cutter was also recovered from him.
The victim suffered the following injuries as a result: 
 
 
a incised wound extending from upper part of forehead between nose and eye on the left side extending below along nasio-labial fold up to the chin on left side measuring about 20 cm; 
 
b incised wound extending from left side of cheek to left ala of nose measuring about 4 cm; 
 
c incised wound over outer end of left upper eyelid measuring about 2 cm; 
 
d incised wound over upper end of columella of nose measuring 1 cm; 
 
e incised wound in front of right ear extending downward and forward direction towards body of mandible and then extending to middle of upper part of neck measuring about 16 cm; 
 
f incised wound extending from middle of right side neck to the inner end of left clavicle; 
 
g incised wound over anterior chest, near clavicle on right side measuring 5 cm; 
 
h fractures of 5th metacarpal and proximal phalanx of little finger of right hand.
  
 
 
The victim was warded for two nights at the hospital. The incised wounds were sutured while the fractures were conservatively treated. According to the medical report, the multiple slash wounds over the face will result in scarring and permanent disfigurement.
 Charge under s 8(b)(i) read with s 33(3) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)
The respondent was arrested on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug. A urine specimen was taken from him and forwarded to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. It was subsequently confirmed that the urine specimen contained 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, which is a cannabinol derivative (cannabis). Prior to this, the respondent had been previously convicted on 15 May 1987 for an offence of consumption of a controlled drug for which he was fined a sum of $500.
 Mitigation in the court below 
 
 
 
The prosecution did not address the court on sentence in the court below. It was however revealed that the respondent had a lengthy history of previous convictions spanning from 1979 to date. These consisted of various offences involving the use of force, including a conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, affray, voluntarily causing hurt as well as theft and drug related offences for which he was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment ranging from one day to six years and fines. He was also sentenced to six strokes of the cane for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. In addition, the respondent had other drug related antecedents. He was admitted to drug rehabilitation centres on three occasions (in 1987, 1988 and 1990) and had also been placed under drug supervision on four previous occasions.
In mitigation, counsel for the respondent in the court below relied on the fact that he was married with two young children aged six and ten. The respondent claimed that he was waylaid and assaulted by the victim and his friends some five weeks prior to the incident during which he sustained a 13 cm laceration. In essence, the respondent claimed that the attack was precipitated by the victim who had made fun of a scar on the respondent`s right check. It was also submitted that the previous consumption offence was committed a long time ago and that the current offence was committed because of the stress arising from investigation into the assault incident. Finally, his counsel submitted that preventive detention would be too harsh a punishment as it offered no prospect of remission.
 The sentence imposed by the district judge 
 
 
 
The respondent was aged 43 at the time of the offences. The district judge noted that the previous convictions showed the respondent to be a man of violence and a menace to society. Accordingly he called for a preventive detention report which confirmed that the respondent was suitable for preventive detention. The district judge noted that it was clear that the respondent faced the prospect of a substantial period of imprisonment.
After counsel`s renewed mitigation, the district judge reconsidered the previous convictions. He noted that the respondent`s most serious offence was committed in 1979 and that the longest prison term which he received in the 1990s was for a period of eight months for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant. He also noted that no weapons or dangerous means were used in his past offences. The district judge held that he retained the discretion not to impose preventive detention, especially if the court was satisfied that its protective purpose could also be achieved by a substantial term of imprisonment. He thus declined to impose preventive detention and sentenced the respondent to a total of seven years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The prosecution contended that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and urged me to impose a sentence of preventive detention with caning. In its written grounds of appeal, the prosecution contended that the district judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the respondent`s previous convictions which demonstrated him to be a menace to society. It was also submitted that the district judge had failed to appreciate the gravity of the respondent`s offence and had given undue consideration to his renewed mitigation. Finally the prosecution submitted that the district judge had failed to give adequate consideration to the need to protect the public and had wrongly exercised his discretion in declining to sentence the respondent to preventive detention.
 Whether a substantial period of custody is expedient for the protection of the public 
 
 
 
In view of the respondent`s age and previous convictions, this was potentially a case which called for preventive detention The regime of preventive detention is prescribed by s 12(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC): 
 
Where a person who is not less than 30 years of age -
 
 
 
 
(a) is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards, and has been convicted on at least 3 previous occasions since he attained the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; or 
 
(b) ...
  
 
 
then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of the sentence, the Court, unless it has special reasons for not so doing, shall pass, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of preventive detention of such term of not less than 7 nor more than 20 years as the Court may determine.
 
 
 
As I have previously stated in 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
  at 389F, preventive detention is a fitting punishment when an offender poses a `menace to society`. I have recently affirmed and reiterated this position in 
PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
  at [para ] 9 and 10 where I stated: 
 
... the purpose of imposing preventive detention is in order to protect the public. If the offender in question proved by his history of criminal behaviour to be a menace to society, he should be and must be put away for the protection and safety of the community at large.
 
 
 
Bearing in mind the objective and rationale behind the imposition of preventive detention, it should be clear that this sentence is meant essentially for habitual offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation.
 
 
 
Thus, the first question which arose in this appeal was whether the respondent had proved by his history of criminal behaviour to be a menace to society which necessitated his incarceration for a substantial period of time for the protection and safety of the community at large. In calling for the preventive detention report, the district judge had himself noted that the previous convictions showed the respondent to be a man of violence and a menace to society.
The respondent was now 43 years of age. His criminal career began in 1979 and he had since garnered a total of 17 convictions in the space of some 20 years, including the present two offences. These consisted of a variety of assault offences, including an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, theft offences and drug related offences. It was evident that the respondent had been drifting in and out of prison with alarming regularity and frequency, combined with several stints in drug rehabilitation centres and periods of drug supervision.
As for the drug consumption offence, the respondent had proved to be unrepentant despite the various opportunities to reform. In this regard, the district judge, in my view, erred in not according sufficient weight to his previous drug convictions and antecedents. Whilst it was true that his last consumption offence was committed in 1987 for which he was fined $500, he was however recently convicted of similar drug-related offences of failing to report for urine tests in 1995 and possession of a controlled drug in 1996.
A review of the previous convictions and the circumstances of the instant offence revealed the respondent`s propensity for violence. His first conviction in 1979 was for an extremely grave offence of manslaughter for which he was sentenced to six years` imprisonment with six strokes of the cane. Evidently, this lengthy period of incarceration left a minimal impression on him as he proceeded to re-offend almost immediately upon his release. His tendency to resort to violence and use of force was confirmed by the subsequent convictions for affray and voluntarily causing hurt. The respondent also demonstrated a blatant disregard for authority as evidenced by his previous convictions for causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duties and for obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public functions.
More importantly, the instant offence revealed a disconcerting escalation in the degree of danger which he posed to the public. The severity of the injuries inflicted had graduated from simple hurt to grievous hurt. In addition, the respondent had now resorted to the use of a dangerous weapon. Contrary to the district judge`s view, the fact that this was the first time that the respondent had used a weapon was completely devoid of any mitigating value. Instead it merely attested to the respondent`s increasingly violent streak.
The circumstances of the present offence were particularly pertinent. By the respondent`s own account, the attack was triggered by a mere comment about the respondent`s facial feature. This precipitated a totally unwarranted and vicious attack on the defenceless victim which persisted until the latter collapsed. The respondent thereupon coolly walked away from the scene. As a result of the attack, the victim suffered two fractures on his finger and multiple slash wounds, ranging from 1 cm to 20 cm in length. Notably, the slash wounds were concentrated on a vulnerable part of the victim`s body, namely, his face and neck and had resulted in permanent scarring and disfigurement. It was fortunate that the assault did not occasion more serious injuries.
Far from showing any contrition or remorse for his actions, the respondent sought to shift the blame, attempting to excuse his conduct by insinuating that the victim had provoked it with his comment about the respondent`s facial scar and by reference to an earlier incident in which the respondent was allegedly attacked by one of the victim`s friends. Even if true, this could hardly justify the brutality and viciousness of the attack.
Taking all the circumstances into account, I had no doubt in my mind that the respondent had shown himself to be a habitual offender and too recalcitrant for reformation. As reflected in his criminal history and obvious lack of remorse, he was patently a man of violence and was a menace to society as well as posing a high risk of re-offending. I was therefore of the view that the respondent ought to be incarcerated for a substantial period of time for the protection of the public.
 Factors taken into account by the court below 
 
 
 
In my view, little weight should have been placed on counsel`s renewed mitigation that the respondent had two young children. This plea had induced the district judge to reconsider the respondent`s previous convictions. I have previously stated that it is settled law that hardship caused to the offender`s family as a result of the imprisonment of the offender has little mitigating value save in very exceptional or extreme circumstances: 
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
  at [para ] 43. This is an unavoidable consequence occasioned by the offender`s own criminal conduct and could not affect what would otherwise be the right sentence: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  at p 308, 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
  at [para ] 31. The same view was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Yap Koon Mong
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 257
  at [para ] 34-36. It was evident that the present circumstances were not so exceptional as to warrant a reduction in the appropriate sentence.
In declining to impose preventive detention, the district judge also took into account the fact that the longest sentence imposed on the respondent in the 1990s was a term of eight months. I agreed with the prosecution`s written submission that this was an erroneous approach. The criteria for the imposition of preventive detention is that set out in s 12(2)(a) or s 12(2)(b) CPC. The provision does not stipulate a minimum term for an offender`s previous sentences and does not require the previous sentences to correspond to the minimum period of preventive detention. Indeed an offender who has committed a perpetual string of offences for which he was sentenced to varying imprisonment terms of under one year is precisely the type of offender targeted by the provision.
In 
 PP v Wong Wing Hung 
 at [para ] 8, I had pointed out that the district judge had erred in law and in principle by drawing a comparison between the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence in question and the minimum term of preventive detention. As I stated in that case (at [para ] 10): 
 
... The minimum term stipulated in s 12(2) of `not less than 7 years` indicates that the normal limitations on sentencing do not apply when the court is considering a sentence of preventive detention. 
 It would be a mistake to confuse a sentence of preventive detention with a term of imprisonment as the two are obviously distinct sentences
. The wording of s 12(2) cannot be more unambiguous when it states that preventive detention is to be imposed `in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
A different sentencing framework has been provided for imprisonment and preventive detention. A district court may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years on a single charge - s 11(3)(a) CPC. Where justified by the offender`s previous convictions and antecedents a sentence of up to ten years can be imposed pursuant to the proviso to s 11(3). The term of imprisonment is of course subject to the statutory limits prescribed by the offence creating statute. The period of preventive detention on the other hand, ranges from a minimum of seven years up to a maximum of 20 years - s 12(2) CPC.
In other words, in a normal situation an offender can only be sentenced by a district judge up to a maximum of seven years on a single charge. This would either correspond to or be less than the minimum period of preventive detention. If the offence in question is punishable with imprisonment for up to two years, the offender would only have been sentenced to no more than two years imprisonment in any case. Thus, in the same vein, any comparison between the sentences previously imposed on the offender and the minimum period of preventive detention is misconceived and constitutes a misreading of the law and objective of preventive detention.
 Manner in which discretion is to be exercised 
 
 
 
Having met the threshold that `it is expedient for the protection of the public` that the offender `be detained in custody for a substantial period of time`, how should the court then proceed in deciding whether to sentence the offender to preventive detention or to imprisonment?
I need look no further than the plain and unequivocal language of s 12(2) CPC: 
 
 
 ... if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time
, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of the sentence, 
 the Court, unless it has special reasons for not so doing, shall pass
, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of preventive detention. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Although the district judge found the respondent to be a recalcitrant offender and a menace to society, he declined to impose preventive detention. He relied on the New Zealand decision of 
R v Leitch
 
[1998] 1 NZLR 420
 and held that he retained the discretion not to impose preventive detention, particularly when the protective purpose of preventive detention could be met by a substantial term of imprisonment. In that case, the New Zealand Court of Appeal was considering s 75(2) of the New Zealand Criminal Justice Act 1985 which provided for the sentence of preventive detention for certain specified offences, including sexual offences: 
 
Subject to the provisions of this section, the High Court, if it is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that an offender to whom this section applies should be detained in custody for a substantial period, 
 may pass a sentence of preventive detention
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It was in the context of this provision that Richardson P, delivering the judgment of the court at p 429 stated that: 
 
... s 75(2) does not require the court to impose preventive detention whenever it is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public to detain the offender in custody for a substantial period. The court `may` pass a sentence of preventive detention. At that point, when weighing the exercise of the discretion, the court will ordinarily consider whether the protective purpose of preventive detention could reasonably be met by an available finite sentence of imprisonment. And there may perhaps be other considerations which in particular circumstances may justify the court in the proper exercise of discretion not to impose preventive detention. Nevertheless, what is clear on this analysis is that, as the court put it in 
 R v Rameka
 (Court of Appeal, Wellington, CA 178/97, 18 June 1997), `the statutory test is not to be burdened by the notion that preventive detention is a sentence of last resort`.
 
 
 
Where the `expedient` standard is met it is of course appropriate in the exercise of the residual discretion to compare the statutory incidents and effects of preventive detention and an available finite sentence. A comparison of that kind may assist the sentencing court in deciding whether, following its assessment of the risk of reoffending at an appreciably distant future time, the necessarily substantial period of detention should be by way of an indefinite or an available finite term. If, compared with an available finite sentence, preventive detention would be longer than necessary to meet the objectives, the indeterminate sentence would be manifestly excessive. ...
 
 
 
A review of the New Zealand provision immediately reveals two critical differences as compared to s 12(2) CPC. First, as opposed to the imperative language of s 12(2) CPC, the New Zealand provision specifies that the court `may` pass a sentence of preventive detention. While the New Zealand courts possess an unfettered residual discretion to impose either imprisonment or preventive detention, s 12(2) CPC specifically prescribes that the court shall impose preventive detention in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment unless there are special reasons for not doing so. Logically speaking, this also means that the New Zealand courts are entitled to take into account a much broader range of considerations in deciding whether to impose a sentence of preventive detention.
Secondly, unlike s 12(2) which provides for a finite term of preventive detention of between seven to twenty years, s 77 of the New Zealand Criminal Justice Act provides for an indefinite period of preventive detention. Under the New Zealand system, an offender sentenced to preventive detention `shall be detained until released on the direction of the Parole Board`. Following release, as explained by Richardson P at p 430, detainees remain subject to recall to continue serving the sentence, unlike an offender who has completed a finite term of imprisonment. I was thus unable to share the district judge`s view that the difference was not material. It was patent from the above extract that the exposure to an indefinite sentence was a significant factor in the decision. Such a sentence might be manifestly excessive under certain circumstances, thus necessitating the need to explore other available finite sentences. This concern however, does not arise in the Singapore context as the court pronounces a finite term of preventive detention commensurate with the circumstances of the case. The offender is also not subject to recall once he completes the specified period of preventive detention.
It is also pertinent to note that the prosecution in that case conceded on appeal that a term of preventive detention was excessive and should be replaced by a finite term. There was also expert evidence on appeal that the risk of re-offending would be diminished if the offender engaged in and completed a rehabilitative programme (at p 421). The facts were thus clearly distinguishable from the present case.
I therefore declined to follow the approach advocated in 
 R v Leitch 
. In view of the significant differences in the legislative provisions, it would be inappropriate to simply adopt the New Zealand decision without a proper understanding of its underlying reasoning and rationale. While reliance on foreign case law can provide a useful source of jurisprudence, one needs always to be cautious in citing decisions which hinge on the interpretation of a distinctly different statutory framework and policy.
With that in mind, I now take this opportunity to clarify the application of s 12(2) CPC as follows. When the criteria set out in s 12(2)(a) or s 12(2)(b) are met and if the court is satisfied that the offender poses such a danger to the public that it is expedient to detain him in custody for a substantial period of time, the court must sentence him to preventive detention unless there are special reasons rendering the offender unsuitable for preventive detention.
Applying the above principle, the district judge erred in holding that he retained the discretion not to impose preventive detention and that the protective purpose of preventive detention could be met by a substantial term of imprisonment once the threshold was met. This approach misconstrued the effect of s 12(2) CPC. Unlike the New Zealand courts, it was not open to the court below, in the absence of special reasons, to explore the alternative sentences.
In this regard, I must reiterate my earlier exhortation in 
 PP v Wong Wing Hung 
 at [para ] 10 not to confuse the concept of preventive detention and imprisonment, which are distinct sentences and are underpinned by different objectives and rationales. The former is essentially aimed at the protection of the public while the latter reflects the traditional policies of prevention, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. They are different in duration, character and implementation. As such, it would be a mistake to view them as fungible sentences.
This is also an appropriate juncture to address the prosecution`s contention that the district judge erred in according weight to the mitigation that preventive detention would be too harsh as it offered no prospect of remission. This was one of the reasons cited by the district judge for reconsidering the respondent`s previous convictions.
The threshold test is whether the offender poses such a menace to society that it would be expedient for the protection of the public to subject him to a substantial period of incarceration. This stage of the enquiry should simply focus on the danger which the offender poses to the community at large. Whether he should be incarcerated under the regime of imprisonment or preventive detention is not the subject of the enquiry at this stage. Correspondingly, it therefore follows that the prospect of remission is also not a relevant consideration.
Once that threshold is met, s 12(2) CPC stipulates that the offender shall be sentenced to preventive detention unless there are special reasons for not doing so. The provision does not go on to explain what constitutes `special reasons`. I am however inclined to agree with the prosecution`s submission that these would generally refer to the offender`s physical and mental suitability for preventive detention. This view is supported by reference to s 12(3) CPC which specifically requires the court to `consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability for such a sentence`. No other matters are specifically mentioned in s 12. It is not possible for me to elucidate in vacuo the circumstances which can amount to special reasons. Suffice to say, the reasons must be exceptional and each case would depend on its own facts.
As far as the present respondent was concerned, the lack of remission could hardly constitute a `special reason`. As I have previously commented in 
Yusoff bin Hassan & Ors v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1032
  at pp 1034I-1035A, `corrective training and preventive detention are meant to supplant a sentence of imprisonment which would otherwise be ordered` and should be passed `in lieu of the aggregate sentence of imprisonment which the court would otherwise have been minded to impose`. It is thus quite inappropriate and irregular for the court to take into account the possibility of remission or the lack thereof. The sentencing court should simply address its mind to the appropriate period of custody merited by the offences for which the offender has been convicted before it and his criminal record, without delving into the issue of remission. In my view, the district judge had clearly misdirected himself by taking this factor into consideration.
Finally, I would only add that the district judge`s observation that preventive detention is served fully with no prospect of remission needs to be clarified. The Criminal Procedure (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Rules provides for the release of prisoners sentenced to preventive detention on license, under certain conditions, when he has served five-sixths or two-thirds of his sentence - r 18. However, a prisoner who has been released on license can be recalled in which case he shall be detained in prison until the expiration of his sentence.
In conclusion, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case and the respondent`s criminal history, I was satisfied that preventive detention for a period of ten years would be an appropriate period of custody.
 Other considerations 
 
 
 
I should add that if, for any reason, preventive detention was not suitable for the respondent, I would have been minded to increase the sentences of imprisonment imposed by the district judge as the aggregate sentence of seven years was manifestly inadequate.
Section 326 Penal Code provides for imprisonment for life, or for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to a fine or caning. Section 8(b)(i) read with s 33(3) Misuse of Drugs Act provides for a minimum term of three years` imprisonment, up to a maximum of ten years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine of up to $20,000.
In view of the respondent`s atrocious criminal history, I would have been minded to apply the proviso to s 11(3) CPC which would have permitted me to sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a term longer than the normal district court jurisdictional limit of seven years, at least insofar as it relates to the offence under s 326 Penal Code. The proviso states: 
 
Provided that where a District Court has convicted any person and it appears that by reason of any previous conviction or his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded, then the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and shall record its reason for so doing.
 
 
 
Furthermore, since the respondent was convicted of two distinct charges, I would have jurisdiction in any case, to award an aggregate punishment of imprisonment of up to twice the ordinary jurisdictional competence of the court, ie 14 years - see proviso to s 17 CPC which states: 
 
When a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences the court may sentence him for such offences to the several punishments prescribed therefor which such court is competent to inflict; such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration of the other in such order as the court directs or to run concurrently if the court so direct, ...
 
 
 
Provided that if the case is tried by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court the aggregate punishment of imprisonment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which such Court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is competent to inflict.
 
 
 
I was of course mindful of the fact that s 11(3)(a) CPC states that the district court is competent to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years as well as the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 885
 . The accused in that case, was convicted in the district court of three counts of criminal breach of trust. The offences were punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code with imprisonment which may extend to seven years and the offender was also liable to a fine. The accused was sentenced to two years` imprisonment on the first two charges and 18 months on the remaining charge. No fine was imposed. The first two charges were ordered to run consecutively, amounting to an aggregate sentence of four years.
On appeal to the High Court, I did not disturb the custodial sentences but enhanced the totality of the sentence by imposing a fine of $200,000, in default two years` imprisonment on each of the first two charges. The consequence of this was that, if the accused did not pay or was unable to pay the fines, she would receive a total of eight years` imprisonment.
The following question was then reserved for the Court of Appeal: 
 
Whether the High Court, in exercising its jurisdiction in an appeal as to sentence, has the power to enhance the sentence beyond the limit of the power of the subordinate court which imposed the sentence.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal answered the question in the negative. Applying the principle to the facts, Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the enhanced sentence which I had imposed on appeal exceeded the sentencing powers of the district court. As a result, the Court of Appeal set aside the fines and enhanced the terms of imprisonment on each of the first two charges to three years, resulting in an aggregate sentence of six years` imprisonment.
This court is of course bound by the principle of law enunciated by the Court of Appeal. However, I was of the view that the actual result reached in that decision was distinguishable from the present case and did not prohibit me from enhancing the sentence by imposing an aggregate term of imprisonment which was longer than seven years.
First, the proviso to s 11(3) CPC was not applicable in that case. There, the maximum period of imprisonment was limited by s 408 Penal Code to a term of seven years. Furthermore, unlike the accused in that case, the respondent in the present appeal had an atrocious history of previous conviction or antecedents which, in my opinion, was capable of triggering the proviso to s 11(3). This would have entitled the district court to award a sentence in excess of seven years for the offences in question.
Secondly, I noted that the proviso to s 17 CPC which would have enabled the sentencing court to impose an aggregate sentence of up to 14 years did not appear to have been cited to the Court of Appeal. In my respectful view, if this highly relevant provision had been highlighted, the Court of Appeal might not have found the fines and the enhanced sentences to have exceeded the jurisdictional competence of the sentencing court.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In conclusion, I agreed with the prosecution that the total sentence of seven years` imprisonment meted out by the district judge was manifestly inadequate. Accordingly, I set aside the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the district judge in the court below and sentenced the respondent to preventive detention for a period of ten years. I did not disturb the sentence in relation to the six strokes of the cane ordered against the respondent.

Tay Yong Kwang J:
The charges
1
         
 Tan Ping Koon (“the first accused”) claimed trial to the following charge:
You, Tan Ping Koon, on the 25
th
 of December 2003, at about 4.30 pm at No XX YY Avenue, Singapore, together with one Chua Ser Lien, and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, abducted one S (Date of Birth: 28.06.1996), with intent to hold the said S for ransom, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3 of the Kidnapping Act, Chapter 151, read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
I have omitted the house number and street name, and used a pseudonym “S” as the name of the victim as she is only eight years old now and still resides in that house which I shall refer to as “the house in question”.
2
         
 Chua Ser Lien (“the second accused”) claimed trial to a similar charge except that in his charge, the name of the first accused in the charge above has been substituted with that of the second accused and 
vice versa
.
The Statement of Agreed Facts
3
         
 The Prosecution and the two teams of defence counsel for the accused persons managed to draw up a Statement of Agreed Facts, thereby obviating the calling of dozens of witnesses to testify in court, including the victim and two of her young siblings. By this very pragmatic and focused approach to fulfilling their duties to the court and to their respective clients, they have saved a lot of time for the witnesses, the investigators and the court and probably spared the young witnesses some anxiety as well. I am therefore deeply appreciative of the pre-trial work done by Deputy Public Prosecutor David Khoo, Mr Subhas Anandan and Mr Lee Teck Leng, the respective lead counsel for the Defence, and their assistants. I am pleased to note that such a commendable attitude has always been characteristic of Mr Subhas Anandan and Mr Lee Teck Leng whenever they appear in my court.
4
         
 I now highlight the salient points in the Statement of Agreed Facts, which incorporated, by reference, the statements made by both accused persons to the police during the investigations.
5
         
 The first accused is now 35 years old while the second accused is now 42 years old. They both resided in the Tampines public housing estate and have known each other for about seven years. Both were self-employed. In late 2003, both of them were heavily in debt, each owing his creditors about half a million dollars or more.
6
         
 In early December 2003, they met to discuss ways of settling their huge debts. At first, they toyed with the idea of trafficking in drugs but decided that was too risky and would not give them the returns they needed to solve their financial woes. The second accused then suggested kidnap as an alternative and the first accused agreed to join him.
7
         
 About a week before Christmas 2003, with the pressure from creditors and from business expenses building up, the two friends “decided to go for it”. They reckoned they required about $2m to settle their problems and therefore begun to discuss the possible targets who could afford to pay this amount. They eventually narrowed the possibilities to two companies.
8
         
 Later, they went to the then Registry of Companies and Businesses in International Plaza and, with the assistance of the staff there, obtained the print-outs on the particulars of the two companies, which included the residential addresses of their directors. The first accused noted that one of the companies, a public one, had an impressive paid-up capital.
9
         
 The next day, they drove to the residential addresses of the respective managing directors of the said companies to do a survey. After some time, they decided to zero in on the managing director of the public listed company. Through a childhood friend, the second accused had heard about that managing director and was confident he could afford to pay a ransom of $2m. The childhood friend used to be a business partner of the said managing director. They then did a stake-out on the business premises of that company and the home of that managing director to confirm that he was living at that residential address by noting the presence of the same chauffeur-driven luxury car in both locations. The said managing director, whom I shall refer to as D, is the father of S and the residential address is the one stated in the kidnapping charges.
10
       
 The accused persons decided to kidnap one of D’s children. They would keep the kidnapped child in the first accused’s flat and then ask D for a ransom of $2m. They planned to use the second accused’s car, a silver-coloured Toyota RAV-4 with the registration number SDS 6603Z. To prepare for the kidnap, they went to several shops in the Ubi industrial estate and purchased wrapping papers and sunshades to try to disguise the RAV-4, masking tape, a screwdriver, two black caps and nylon string. They also went to make false number plates for the RAV-4, coming up with the fictitious registration number SDM 4569 (according to the second accused) or SBM 4569Z (according to the first accused). All these items were kept in the RAV-4.
11
       
 On 23 December 2003, the second accused spent $400 buying 4D lottery tickets on the real and the fictitious registration numbers (6603 and 4569). He informed the first accused that if any of the numbers should strike on Christmas eve, they would have a windfall of almost $200,000 and would then call off the kidnap. However, luck eluded them.
12
       
 On Christmas day, the second accused contacted the first accused around noon and they decided to drive to the house in question to have a look. They noticed the family’s multi-purpose vehicle (“MPV”) parked along the road outside the house. D’s luxury car was not around. The gates were opened and there were three or four female adults talking in the garden. There were also two or three children in the compound of the house. They decided it was a good time to kidnap any of the children. They then drove to a small lane not too far away to change the number plates of the RAV-4 and to “decorate” or disguise it by pasting wrapping paper on the doors and the spare tyre cover. They also placed the sunshades on the windows and the rear windscreen. From there, the first accused took over as the driver as he was “too fat for fast movement”.
13
       
 They returned to the house in question but the children could no longer be seen. They parked the RAV-4 behind the MPV. The second accused used the screwdriver to release the air from the MPV’s left front and rear tyres and then returned to his car to have a cigarette. He told the first accused to be ready by putting on his black cap and having the car in “drive” gear. At about 4.30pm, he walked to the house in question.
14
       
 D’s family was preparing for a Christmas party to be held in the house later that evening. The gates were left ajar as the catering assistants and the event co-ordinator were setting up the buffet tables and the decorations. D was not home at that time. His wife was on the second level of the three-storey house. Three of their children were in the living room. Two of them were seated on the floor playing electronic games on the television set while S was seated on the sofa behind them.
15
       
 As the second accused walked into the compound of the house, he used a handkerchief to mask the lower half of his face. He opened the main door leading to the living room and saw the three children. He decided to grab hold of S because she was nearest to him. He then carried S and dashed out of the house with her. When S started screaming, he used his left hand to cover her mouth. The first accused heard the screaming and quickly pulled the RAV-4 to the front entrance of the house. The second accused opened the rear door and jumped into the back seat with S. The car then sped away towards Yio Chu Kang Road.
16
       
 Coincidentally, as the second accused was making his way into the house earlier, Ang Teck Ann arrived at the house in his van with his wife, Chua Siew Eng and her colleague, Ho Yen Yen. Both ladies worked as catering assistants and were there to help set up the buffet. Ang Teck Ann was giving them a lift there. After letting the two ladies alight, Ang Teck Ann drove off. As they walked into the compound of the house, the second accused dashed out carrying S.
17
       
 Ho Yen Yen and one of S’s siblings noticed that the getaway car was white in colour. In addition, Ho Yen Yen managed to catch a glimpse of its registration number plate which, she believed, was SDN 4569. In the meantime, S’s mother, who had heard the commotion, went down to the ground floor and was informed by her two children and the catering assistants about what had happened. She immediately called the police who received the following message:
My daughter was kidnapped. We were in the middle of a party when a man came in a white Mercedes and took her away in the vehicle. The vehicle is SDN 4569. It is going towards Punggol direction.
It was unclear who told her the getaway car was a Mercedes.
18
       
 Ho Yen Yen told Chua Siew Eng to alert her husband about the getaway car. Chua Siew Eng then called her husband on his mobile phone, told him about the incident and asked him to look out for a car bearing the number 4569. He was then in the vicinity of Yio Chu Kang Road. About that time, the speeding RAV-4 overtook his van, made a U-turn and headed for Pasir Ris. Ang Teck Ann followed the RAV-4 in his van.
19
       
 Inside the RAV-4, the second accused wanted to use a T-shirt to cover S’s face but she told him not to do so, promising him she would not tell her mother. He also wanted to use masking tape on her mouth but did not do so as she said she was afraid. They spoke to each other casually. She told him she did not know her father’s name when he asked her about it.
20
       
 The first accused then informed the second accused that there was a white vehicle tailing them and that that vehicle had earlier dropped off two passengers outside the house in question. After noticing that the white vehicle was following their every move, they decided to abandon S. Along Pasir Ris Street 72, they stopped the RAV-4 and the second accused opened its left rear door and told S to alight. The RAV-4 then sped off leaving the barefooted S standing by the roadside, scared and crying.
21
       
 Ang Teck Ann pulled up in his van and told S to get on board. After she did so, he tried to chase the RAV-4 but lost sight of it. He then returned to the house in question with S. By that time, the police and S’s father were at the house.
22
       
 In the meantime, the two accused persons brought the RAV-4 to a multi-storey carpark where they removed all the “decorations” and replaced the false registration number plates with the genuine ones. They were a bit disappointed that the said white vehicle had foiled their plans. After that, they went to the first accused’s office in the cargo complex of Changi International Airport where they burnt the false number plates and some of their kidnapping paraphernalia in an incense bin. They then returned to their respective homes.
23
       
 That night, they met again to discuss the incident. They wondered whether S’s family had reported the incident to the police. They decided to call D the next day to ask him for money in return for the safety of his family.
24
       
 On 26 December 2003, the second accused went to purchase two phone cards. He then went to have lunch with the first accused. After lunch, the first accused called D’s company and managed to obtain D’s handphone number from one of the staff. The first accused then called D and told him he was the one who kidnapped his daughter the day before. He claimed that his boss had instructed him to kill D’s children in return for a reward of $5m but he could not bear to do so as S was a lovely child. He said he could have pushed S out of the car the previous day if he had wanted to kill her. He claimed that his gang wanted to escape and he asked D to give him $1m. D replied that $1m was not a small amount and asked him to call again at night. D then reported the matter to the police.
25
       
 When the first accused called D again that night, D told him he needed time to raise the $1m from his friends. When D asked him who the mastermind of the kidnap was, he was told that the boss was from a foreign land. D then asked him to call again in about an hour.
26
       
 At about 9.43pm, the first accused called D to ask how much money he had managed to raise. When D said he needed more time, the first accused told him he was in urgent need of funds as he intended to return to his homeland as soon as possible. He reminded D he could have finished off his daughter with a knife but did not do so. This time, D was told that the boss behind all this was a local. D promised to do his best to raise as much money as possible. He asked the caller to call again between 10.30pm and 11.00pm that night.
27
       
 At about 11.40pm, the first accused called D to ask how much money he had mustered, D told him he could raise $30,000 to $40,000 only. The first accused sounded annoyed and told D he would receive $5m for kidnapping his children and $2m for killing one of them. He said the sum raised was not enough for him and his gang to share and added that D’s life should be worth more than his. D tried to calm him down by promising to do his very best to raise more money, adding that he was grateful his daughter was not harmed and he would be told who the mastermind was after paying the money. He asked the caller to call him again after noon the next day.
28
       
 On 27 December 2003, around noon, D got another call. He managed to persuade the caller to accept $70,000. The caller then told D he would call again to give further instructions. With the assistance of police officers, D prepared and packed $70,000 into a black briefcase. The serial numbers of the notes had been recorded on five pieces of paper.
29
       
 At about 2.00pm, D was told by the caller to leave his house alone immediately. D did so and while he was driving along the Pan Island Expressway, the caller called to instruct him to make a U-turn towards the city. He was then directed to stop at lamppost 295 and to proceed to the nearby emergency telephone booth number 707 and to leave the briefcase containing the money there. He was then told to return home.
 
 30
      
 The first accused, who had positioned himself on an overhead bridge overseeing the said telephone booth, signalled to the second accused, who was hiding in some bushes in the vicinity, to retrieve the briefcase from the telephone booth. The second accused did so and then walked back to the public carpark at Block 528 Bedok North Street 3 where they had parked the RAV-4. He took out the money and discarded the briefcase at a rubbish collection centre nearby. He then drove the car to pick up the first accused at their designated meeting point at Block 722 Bedok Reservoir Road. They left together for lunch at a coffee shop at Block 164 Tampines Street 12.
 
31
       
 After lunch, the pair walked back to the car where they were pounced on by police officers and arrested. The police officers recovered a bundle of $1,000 and $50 notes amounting to $10,000 near the front seats of the car and six pieces of $10,000 notes from a bag in its boot. The serial numbers of these notes matched those written down by the police earlier.
32
       
 Upon this Statement of Agreed Facts, the Prosecution closed its case.
No case to answer
33
       
 Both counsel for the accused persons then requested a day’s break in the proceedings to prepare their submissions of no case to answer on the kidnapping charges. They were of the view that the facts contained in the Statement of Agreed Facts did not disclose an offence under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 151, 1999 Rev Ed) as no demand for ransom had been made before S was released. I granted the request and adjourned the trial to Wednesday, 8 September 2004.
34
       
 However, in the afternoon of Tuesday, 7 September 2004, I was informed that both defence counsel had called to say that their clients would plead guilty to the respective kidnapping charges.
Plea of guilt
35
       
 On Wednesday, 8 September 2004, both defence counsel informed the court that they had looked further into the law relating to the kidnapping charges and were now satisfied that an offence under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act had been made out on the agreed facts. They said their clients would plead guilty as charged and would accept the Statement of Agreed Facts as it stood. Both accused persons confirmed that they were changing their pleas. They pleaded guilty to the respective kidnapping charge and were convicted accordingly.
36
       
 Each of the two accused persons also faced one charge under s 384 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) of having extorted $70,000 from D between 26 and 27 December 2003 by threatening to cause harm to his family members. These extortion charges were admitted and taken into consideration for sentencing after the two accused persons were convicted on the kidnapping charges.
Antecedents
37
       
 Both accused persons had no previous convictions on record.
Mitigation for the first accused
38
       
 Mr Subhas Anandan submitted that both accused persons should be regarded as having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity as they did not do so on the first day of trial only because of the then unresolved legal issue. The first accused agreed to have a Statement of Agreed Facts thereby sparing the witnesses, especially the eight-year-old S, from having to testify in court. That was a clear demonstration of his remorse.
39
       
 The first accused lived with his nine-year-old daughter in a flat. His wife left him in July 2003 due to some matrimonial problems. That was why the plan was to hold S in his flat after the abduction.
40
       
 He had debts amounting to some $500,000 and was on the run from loan sharks. He had sought refuge in Malaysia but decided to return home because of his daughter. The kidnapping was a very desperate act as he felt there was no other way of solving his financial difficulties.
41
       
 Quoting a medical report dated 3 March 2004 from the Institute of Mental Health in respect of the first accused, Mr Subhas Anandan submitted that if the charge had been one of murder, it would, in all likelihood, have been reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder because of the diminished responsibility of the first accused. The medical report by Dr Gwee Kok Peng concluded:
In my opinion, the accused was suffering from the following at the time of the alleged offence:
1.
        
 Depression with Anxiety
2.
        
 Temporal Lobe Epilepsy
3.
        
 Low intelligence with poor verbal reasoning skills, planning difficulties and concrete thinking. These may be related to his temporal lobe epilepsy.
His depression was manifest as low mood, energy and self-esteem, poor sleep, social withdrawal, suicidal thinking and hopelessness. The contributing stressors were his marital problems, wife’s miscarriage and unemployment, his mother’s stroke, his business failure and financial difficulties.
Given his low intelligence, poor verbal reasoning, planning difficulties and concrete thinking, he had difficulty coping with the multiple stressors at the time. Adding that to the hopelessness aggravated by his depression, he tended to resort to desperate, short-sighted measures.
He was not of unsound mind at the material time. However, his psychiatric problems did impair his judgment.
He is likely to benefit from treatment, which should include problem solving counselling and medication.
He is fit to plead currently.
It was stressed that reliance on the medical report was not to evade responsibility for his acts but merely to plead for the court’s compassion in view of his problems.
42
       
 The abduction lasted less than half an hour and S was not harmed physically although the first accused accepted that there could be some mental trauma. The death penalty was clearly inappropriate here. I was also urged not to order caning in addition to imprisonment for life.
Mitigation for the second accused
43
       
 Mr Lee Teck Leng submitted that imprisonment for life was sufficient punishment in this case “on account of their stupidity in actually asking the victim’s family for money when the victim was no longer in their hands and their stupidity in believing the assurance of the victim’s father that he did not report the matter to the police, and the [second] accused’s psychiatric history which had a direct bearing on the commission of the offence”.
44
       
 The second accused is married with two children aged five and six respectively. He was the sole breadwinner of the family. The younger child is autistic. The second accused was a first offender and was driven by the financial difficulties of his cleaning firm to commit the offence.
45
       
 The victim was released before any ransom was demanded by the accused persons. That meant S’s family did not have to undergo the trauma of negotiating for her release and of scrambling for money to pay the ransom. S was not assaulted nor threatened as there was never any intention to hurt her. She was not tied up or blindfolded. Upon her request, the second accused did not gag her in the car. She was reassured during the ride that they had no intention of harming her. No weapon was used throughout the episode which lasted for less than half an hour only. The second accused was remorseful. He had co-operated fully with the investigators.
46
       
 Like the first accused, the second accused also had psychiatric problems. Dr Lee Cheng of the Institute of Mental Health in a medical report dated 4 February 2004 reported that the second accused “suffers from a Bipolar Disorder” and “has recurrent depressive episodes and a manic episode in May 2001”. The second accused was also found to be fit to plead and to stand trial and not of unsound mind at the material time despite being depressed.
47
       
 Dr Francis Ngui, Consultant Psychiatrist and Medical Director of the Adam Road Hospital, prepared a medical report dated 12 April 2004 on the second accused after examining him on 17 and 22 March 2004. He noted that the second accused had been diagnosed in May 2001 to have Schizoaffective Disorder, a severe form of mental illness. During that time, he was talkative and irrelevant in his speech, had delusions of grandeur and paranoia and heard hallucinatory voices. “He was illogical, his judgment was severely impaired and he was out of touch with reality.” He was hospitalised in Adam Road Hospital between 27 May and 16 June 2001 for treatment.
48
       
 From June 2001 to May 2002, his mental state was stable. From July 2002 onwards, he started complaining about feeling stressed. From October 2002, there was a recurrence of sleeplessness and mood swings. In January 2003, he was noted to be depressed at a clinic review and was started on anti-psychotic medication. He defaulted on his outpatient treatments between March and August 2003. When assessed in August 2003, his mood was significantly depressed and agitated. He was last reviewed on 12 November 2003.
49
       
 Dr Francis Ngui concluded that the second accused had Bipolar Disorder, a major form of mental illness characterised by episodes of severe mood swings. “During such episodes, the person becomes psychotic, losing touch with reality due to impaired judgment and logic.” He was of the opinion that the second accused’s history indicated that:
[H]e was still having a Depressive Episode during December 2003, right up to the time of his offence on Christmas Day. He was demoralised, depressed and kept lamenting about being a failure as a father and husband. He had also stopped his medication for several weeks before the offence.
In my opinion, Mr Chua was suffering from an abnormality of mind caused by his Depressive Episode of his Bipolar Disorder, and this abnormality was severe enough to significantly affect his mental state and substantially impair his mental responsibility for his act of kidnapping. The severity of his Depressive Episode from his Bipolar Disorder caused him to view his financial situation as bleaker than what it really was. As a result, his problem solving capabilities were impaired significantly, restricting his discernment and judgment in finding more appropriate choices to settling his debts.
50
       
 Based on the above medical reports, it was submitted that:
If the [second] accused did not suffer from his mental illness, he would probably not have committed the offence. In light of this diminished responsibility on the part of the [second] accused, we urge the Court to temper justice with mercy.”
51
       
 Finally, two related cases involving sentencing under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act were highlighted to me for guidance. I shall deal with these later.
Prosecution’s submissions on sentence
52
       
 The Prosecution did not wish to make any submissions on sentence.
The decision of the court
53
       
 Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act provides:
Whoever, with intent to hold any person for ransom, abducts or wrongfully restrains or wrongfully confines that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be punished on conviction with death or imprisonment for life and shall, if he is not sentenced to death, also be liable to caning.
Section 2 of the same Act states that “abduction” shall have the meaning assigned to it in s 362 of the Penal Code, which reads:
Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.
Where the charges taken into consideration were concerned, s 384 of the Penal Code provides:
Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 7 years and with caning.
54
       
 The second accused compelled S to go out of her home by forcibly carrying her to the RAV-4 and causing her to be driven away in it. The act of abduction was complete the moment the second accused carried her out of the compound of the house in question onto the road. The words “any place” in s 362 of the Penal Code have to be construed in a commonsensical way according to the particular factual situation. Here, the words would mean the house in question and that would of course include the compound of the house. Abduction is complete even though the intended destination has not been reached or, as in this case, the person abducted was abandoned along the way for whatever reason.
55
       
 However, in order to sustain a conviction under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act, the Prosecution must prove that the abduction was with the intention of holding that person for ransom. I have already attempted to explain what “ransom” means in 
PP v Selvaraju s/o Satippan
 
[2004] SGHC 154
, a decision which is going before the Court of Appeal soon. A demand for ransom made after abduction would offer the best proof of the purpose of the abduction but no demand made does not mean no intention to make a demand. What has to be proved is the intent, not the demand nor the payment of ransom. In the present case, the voluntary statements of both accused persons put the matter beyond any dispute. The only purpose of abducting S was to force her father to pay their price for her release. The offence is complete even if the perpetrators did not succeed in their purpose.
56
       
 The then Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Sia Ah Kew v PP
 
[1972–1974] SLR 208
 noted that the sentencing options in s 3 of the Kidnapping Act were very limited and gave the following guideline (at 210, [5]):
In our opinion the maximum sentence prescribed by the legislature would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or conduct of the kidnappers are such as to outrage the feelings of the community.
On the facts of that case, after noting that kidnapping for ransom was neither rampant nor on the increase in Singapore between 1970 and 1973 and having regard to the fact that two of the five appellants there were armed with pistols and one had a dagger, the court substituted the death sentences with imprisonment for life and ordered caning of between six to twelve strokes to be imposed.
57
       
 In 
PP v Lee Chuan Leong Vincent
 
[2000] SGHC 78
, a 14-year-old female student was kidnapped exactly five years ago by three men in a van while she was walking alone to her home. She was tied up with adhesive tapes and blindfolded. She was then brought to a house and was held there guarded by two of the men for the next 60 hours. She remained blindfolded throughout. A ransom was demanded with threats to kill the victim if the demand was not met. As soon as a ransom was paid by her father, she was released by the kidnappers. The mastermind pleaded guilty to a charge of kidnapping for ransom. The court in that case did not think the death penalty was the appropriate sentence in the light of the guilty plea and since the kidnappers were not armed and had not ill-treated or hurt the victim. Having decided on the sentence of life imprisonment, the court was at first minded to impose six strokes of the cane. However, after hearing the “persuasive mitigation” and considering the absence of a criminal record, the full co-operation rendered to the police, the mastermind’s willingness to testify against his accomplices, the character references and the other factors mentioned earlier, the court decided not to impose caning.
58 
      
 Two days later, the two accomplices pleaded guilty before me on similar charges (see 
PP v Zhou Jian Guang
 
[2000] SGHC 68
). Like the court in the earlier case, I was minded to impose caning in addition to the sentence of life imprisonment but was constrained by the fact that no caning was imposed on the mastermind. Abiding by the principle of parity of sentences and finding no grounds to justify a harsher punishment for the underlings, I could not and did not impose caning on the two accomplices in that case.
59
       
 In 
PP v Selvaraju s/o Satippan
 ([55] 
supra
), I sentenced the kidnapper to imprisonment for life and to receive 24 strokes of the cane. Injury was caused to the 22-year-old victim there. In addition, the kidnapper set fire to the bedroom where he had confined the victim. There were also three other charges involving mischief by fire, voluntarily causing hurt and attempted murder.
60
       
 I turn now to the facts in the present case. I note the medical reports on both the accused persons and sympathise with their problems. Together with the pleas of guilt and the absence of physical harm and of weapons, the appropriate sentence has to be imprisonment for life rather than the death penalty. The only matter that I have to consider now is whether to impose caning as well on one or both of the accused persons.
61
       
 I have studied the statements given by them to the police during the investigations. Those statements show that the discussions and planning for the kidnap took place over at least one week. There was clearly meticulous planning with the second accused appearing to be the more brainy one.
62
       
 Their moves were opportunistic, targeting easy victims like children and intruding into a home at a time when preparations for a party were underway and when strangers would not be immediately noticed. Being parents of young children themselves, the accused persons ought to know the anguish of any parent whose child has gone missing even for a few minutes and, here, the parents of the victim knew that their female seven-year-old child was snatched away by two unknown men.
63
       
 The abandonment of the victim and of their kidnapping plans was not caused by a change of heart but by their sheer hard luck. There was every likelihood they would have held her captive in the first accused’s flat if they had got away without being spotted and followed.
64
       
 Their brazenness was further demonstrated by the extortion bid after the unsuccessful kidnap. The decision that very same evening to demand money in return for the safety of D’s family, the purchase of phone cards the next day, the concocted story told to D, the scouting around for a safe drop-off point for the money, the identification of a vantage point to observe the drop-off and the route they planned for D to take showed clear-thinking, cool and rational minds. After picking up the money, the second accused was able to tell the first accused that it would be “quite troublesome with the S$10,000 notes and we have to think of a way to get rid of the notes”. They even had the presence of mind to discuss this problem while they were having lunch at the coffee shop although they could not arrive at a good solution.
65
       
 Bearing all these matters in mind, I am of the view that caning should be imposed on both the accused persons. In the light of the mitigating factors mentioned earlier, I think three strokes of the cane for each of the accused persons will be enough punishment and will convey the message that kidnapping, especially of vulnerable victims, is likely to be visited with painful consequences. I therefore sentence both accused persons to imprisonment for life with effect from 27 December 2003 (the date of their arrest) and to receive three strokes of the cane each.
66
       
 It is quite obvious that this kidnap would not have lasted only some 30 minutes if Ho Yen Yen, Chua Siew Eng and her husband, Ang Teck Ann, were not fortuitously at the house in question and in its vicinity that Christmas afternoon. Ho Yen Yen was very quick-witted and observant to have noted the registration number of the RAV-4 in those fleeting seconds and amidst the commotion. She also had great presence of mind when she immediately told Chua Siew Eng to call her husband. Chua Siew Eng was helpful and acted quickly in relaying the information to her husband by mobile phone. Ang Teck Ann displayed courage and selflessness in pursuing the RAV-4 assiduously as he could not know whether the kidnappers were dangerous men. His kind actions must have ameliorated to a great extent the horrific experience suffered by the then seven-year-old victim, barefooted and abandoned by the roadside in unfamiliar surroundings. He will be gratified to know that the little girl, in her statement made at the preliminary inquiry, referred to him as the “good man” who “asked me to go inside his car” and “lent me his handphone to talk to my mother and also my brother” and who then “sent me home”. Through this heart-warming public-spiritedness of these three people, a much more heart-rending incident was averted.
67
       
 Finally, this episode exemplifies the superb work done by our police force, whose quiet efficiency and trademark professionalism are essential for the proper administration of the criminal justice system. The swiftness with which the officers identified and arrested the kidnappers is inspiring indeed. There is also little doubt that the very thorough investigations have contributed significantly to the speedy conclusion of this matter.
Both accused persons convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life and to three strokes of the cane each.",2004-09-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellants, Md Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed (“the first appellant”), Rupesh Kumar (“the second appellant”), Rajendran s/o Rajagopal (“the third appellant”), Sambalingam T (“the fourth appellant”), Natarajan s/o Chinnaiah (“the fifth appellant”) and Retnam Mohandas (“the sixth appellant”), were convicted by District Judge Roy Grenville Neighbour of rioting whilst armed with deadly weapons under s 148 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the PC”). In addition, the first and third appellants were convicted for behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1987 Rev Ed), and the sixth appellant was convicted of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the PC: see 
PP v Perumal Naidu Surendra Sean Clinton
 
[2004] SGDC 129
. The appellants appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed all the appeals, and now give my reasons.
The facts
2          This case revolved around the events that occurred on the morning of 20 October 2001 along Prinsep Street. The six appellants, together with two other accused persons, Perumal Naidu Surendra Sean Clinton (“Sean Clinton”) and Manogaran s/o Amirpan Ramaiah (“Manogaran”), were alleged to have rioted whilst armed with deadly weapons that morning. The six appellants, Sean Clinton and Manogaran (“the eight accused persons”) all knew each other prior to the incident that occurred on 20 October 2001. The fourth appellant was the father of the second appellant and Sean Clinton was the second appellant’s uncle. The first appellant was Sean Clinton’s friend. The fifth appellant was a close friend of the fourth appellant. The sixth appellant and Manogaran worked in the fourth appellant’s company, and the third appellant was a friend of the fourth appellant. The eight accused persons were all patrons of Mohican’s Pub, a pub along Prinsep Street which the second appellant was a partner of.
The Prosecution’s case
3          The Prosecution’s case was that on the night of 19 October 2001, Sean Clinton, Manogaran and the appellants, with the exception of the second appellant, were having a drinking session together at Jalan Berseh Food Centre (“JBFC”). Subsequently, at about 3.00am on 20 October 2001, the first appellant, third appellant and Sean Clinton went to Mohican’s Pub for drinks. However, they were not served drinks at the pub, and they left, looking disappointed and unhappy.
4          A while later, the second appellant, one of the owners of the pub, arrived at Prinsep Street. He met up with Mohan s/o Ranjangam (“Mohan”),
[1]
 
Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam (“Rajendran”)
[2]
 
and Selvarajoo s/o Gopal Sellamuthoo (“Appu Rajah”)
[3]
 
outside the gate of the pub. An argument ensued between the second appellant and Mohan. The third appellant was present during this argument, and came in between. Thereafter, the second appellant made a telephone call to his father, the fourth appellant.
5          Around this time, the sixth appellant arrived at Prinsep Street in a taxi, and walked towards the second appellant. The fourth appellant also turned up at Prinsep Street around this time. A few minutes later, four vehicles turned in from Middle Road on to Prinsep Street. Sean Clinton, the owner of the first vehicle, alighted and proceeded to talk to the second appellant. He was seen shouting aggressively at a group of male Indians standing outside Mohican’s Pub. Two to three other persons alighted from each of the four vehicles, the fourth appellant being one of them. A knife was also taken out from the boot of Sean Clinton’s car. Thereafter, these persons walked towards Mohican’s Pub. An argument and subsequently a full-blown fight ensued between this group and the staff of Mohican’s Pub. During this fight, wooden poles, knives and an ice pick were used.
6          In addition, Sean Clinton, the third appellant, the sixth appellant and Manogaran were seen climbing over the wall of Mohican’s Pub. They threw beer barrels and metal chairs at the glass panel of the pub, causing it to shatter. The first appellant was seen armed with a dagger and telling the patrons of Mr Bean’s Café, a café oppose Mohican’s Pub, not to interfere. The second appellant was also seen pacing up and down outside Mr Bean’s Café, telling the patrons not to interfere.
7          The sixth appellant, who was armed with a chopper, then approached one Marc Christopher Oliveiro (“Marc”)
[4]
 
while he was sitting in his vehicle. The sixth appellant grabbed Marc by the shirt and raised the chopper at him. Marc opened the door of his car and managed to escape. For this act, the sixth appellant was charged with criminal intimidation.
8          After the events, the appellants, together with Sean Clinton and Manogaran, left the scene in three vehicles. The police intercepted the vehicles at the junction of Prinsep Street and Middle Road. The first appellant was arrested for disorderly behaviour, and the other appellants, Sean Clinton and Manogaran were subsequently placed under arrest.
The Defence
9          All the appellants denied the charges made against them. The first appellant said that he was with Sean Clinton at the Indian Association on the night of 19 October 2001. They left after midnight for JBFC. At JBFC, they did not see any of the other accused persons. After staying at JBFC for more than an hour, they went to Mohican’s Pub. The first appellant drove Sean Clinton’s car, as Sean Clinton was tired. As the car entered Prinsep Street, there was some human movement along the road, such that the car had to travel at a very slow pace. The car was then stopped by police officers, who asked the first appellant and Sean Clinton for their identification and particulars. The first appellant subsequently heard a police officer calling out to the sixth appellant, who was walking by, in a rude manner. The first appellant thought that this was improper, and identified himself as a customs officer, telling the police officer that he should address members of the public in a more polite manner. Thereafter, the first appellant was placed under arrest for disorderly behaviour.
10        The second appellant said that he was attending the opening ceremony of a pub on the night of 19 October 2001, and at the opening ceremony, he received several prank calls stating that there was trouble at the pub. He then informed the fourth appellant of the calls so that the fourth appellant could check on the pub. Subsequently, when the second appellant arrived at Prinsep Street, he saw Inspector Sajjad Hussein Shah
[5]
 
advising Appu Rajah to lock up the pub, as there were complaints of a commotion at the pub. Appu Rajah did so. As the second appellant was returning to his car, Mohan came towards him and hurled vulgarities at him. He dismissed these rantings and got back into the car. He then saw a scuffle amongst ten to 15 people outside a pub at 72 Prinsep Street. He parked his car directly opposite Prinsep Link. He noticed the fourth appellant’s vehicle coming towards him at that point. The fourth appellant told the second appellant to go home. The fourth appellant then drove off in his car. Subsequently, the second appellant saw the fourth appellant’s and Sean Clinton’s vehicles being stopped at the traffic light. The fourth appellant was subsequently arrested. The second appellant drove the fourth appellant’s car to the police station and the second appellant was arrested after that.
11        The third, fourth and fifth appellants said that they were having drinks at JBFC on the evening of 19 October 2001, together with Manogaran. At JBFC, the fourth appellant received a call from the second appellant, informing him of the prank calls that the second appellant had received. At about 3.30am the next morning, they left JBFC, with the fourth appellant driving the rest home. The third appellant and Manogaran both fell asleep at the back of the vehicle as they were drunk.
12        The fourth appellant then turned into Prinsep Link to check on the pub. He saw the second appellant standing by his car ahead of him, and alighted to speak to him. The fifth appellant also alighted to have a smoke, while the third appellant and Manogaran remained in the car. The fourth appellant told the second appellant to go home. Upon reaching the junction, the fourth appellant’s vehicle was stopped by the police who wanted to check their particulars. They subsequently moved on, but were stopped again by a police patrol car sounding its horn continuously behind them. The fourth appellant’s car was searched and an ice pick was recovered. The third, fourth and fifth appellants and Manogaran were later arrested.
13        The sixth appellant said that he met up with the fourth appellant on the evening of 19 October 2001 for a drinking session. He then became drunk, and could not remember anything else of that evening. The next thing he remembered was being told to go home by a male Indian voice, and subsequently he was arrested at Prinsep Street.
The decision below
14        The trial judge believed the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses who saw the eight accused persons at the scene before and at the time the armed fight broke out. He was satisfied that the witnesses’ identification of all the accused persons was good. He held that the accused persons had taken the law into their own hands by damaging Mohican’s Pub and attacking Mohan. He further held that there was a common object to cause hurt, as some of the accused persons were armed and seen fighting at the scene. The eight accused persons were therefore convicted of rioting with deadly weapons. The sixth appellant was further convicted of criminal intimidation, and the first and third appellants were convicted of disorderly behaviour, the third appellant’s offence being committed at a separate time and place. As the fourth and fifth appellants were above the age of 50 years, they were not liable for caning. The sentence imposed on each of the appellants is summarised in the table below:

The appeal
15        The appeal was brought against both conviction and sentence. The appeal against conviction will be dealt with first, followed by the appeal against sentence.
Appeal against conviction
16        As all the appellants have appealed against their convictions for rioting whilst armed with deadly weapons under s 148 of the PC, I found it appropriate to set out the elements of the offence. The following elements had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in order to establish the charge of rioting whilst armed with deadly weapons against the appellants:
(a)        That there was an assembly of five or more persons.
(b)        That each appellant was a member of that assembly.
(c)        That the common object of that assembly was one of those enumerated in s 141 of the PC.
(d)        That the unlawful assembly used force or violence in prosecution of the common object.
(e)        That each appellant was armed with a deadly weapon.
By virtue of s 149 of the PC, an appellant would be liable under s 148 of the PC if it could be shown that one or more members of the unlawful assembly was armed with a deadly weapon: 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 789
. As s 149 of the PC was listed in the charge against the appellants, it was only necessary to show that one or more members of the unlawful assembly was armed with a deadly weapon for the charges against the appellants to be made out.  In this appeal, the appellants had essentially disputed elements (a), (b), (c) and (e) of the offence of rioting whilst armed with deadly weapons.
17        I also found it appropriate to revisit the well-established principles of law relating to the approach of an appellate court in dealing with an appeal against findings of fact, as the appellants were dissatisfied mainly with the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The general principle is that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or clearly reached against the weight of evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings and his reasons. This principle was laid down in the seminal case of 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
, and I have endorsed the principle in various cases since then: 
Teo Kian Leong v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 147
 and 
PP v Tan Lian Tiong
 
[2002] 3 SLR 461
. In particular, where findings of fact hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, an appellate court should be slow to overturn these findings of fact: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
18        With these principles in mind, I turned to examine each appellant’s grounds of appeal.
The first appellant
19        The first appellant’s main contention was that there were serious doubts as to the evidence of the two main witnesses which was relied on by the trial judge in convicting the first appellant. The two witnesses were Sergeant Yeo Kiat Leng (“Sgt Yeo”)
[6]
 
and Goh Joo Kuan (“Goh”).
[7]
20        With regard to Sgt Yeo’s evidence, the first appellant argued that Sgt Yeo’s identification of the first appellant at the scene must be wrong, as his evidence was inconsistent with Goh’s evidence as to the sequence of events. Also, according to Sgt Yeo, the first appellant arrived at the scene before Sean Clinton, whereas the Prosecution and the trial judge both accepted that the first appellant and Sean Clinton had arrived at the scene together. Further, Sgt Yeo did not identify the first appellant at the scene or at the police station, but identified him only during the hearing which was held more than two years after the incident. I did not accept this submission. Considering the lapse of time between the incident and the hearing, some minor inconsistencies in the evidence of two witnesses were likely. As I have held in 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
 at [17], following the decision of 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
:
Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court.
21        The crucial question here was whether the identification evidence given by Sgt Yeo and Goh was good. To this end, the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 as to the factors that the court should consider in determining the reliability of identification evidence are instructive. These guidelines were reworked in the Court of Appeal case of 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
 at [33]–[35] into the following three-step test:
[(a)]     The first question which a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case where there is identification evidence, is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the defence to be mistaken.
[(b)]     If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made? A non-exhaustive list of factors which could be considered include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness had seen the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. …
[(c)]     Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should go on to ask the third question. Is there any other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification.
22        In the present case, the case against the first appellant depended substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence given by Sgt Yeo and Goh. Sgt Yeo said that he was at Mr Bean’s Café, and he observed the commotion that the first appellant was involved in for about five minutes. His view of the commotion was not obstructed. Further, he was seated facing Prinsep Street, where the commotion occurred. Goh was also at Mr Bean’s Café, sitting at a table that was situated on the pavement facing Mohican’s Pub. He was sitting facing the road. There was evidence from other witnesses that the road was illuminated by streetlights and light from the surrounding pubs. I was therefore convinced that the identification evidence of Sgt Yeo and Goh could be relied upon.
23        The first appellant brought up several points in his contention that Goh’s evidence was unreliable. The first appellant argued that no one else but Goh had given evidence that the first appellant had told the patrons of Mr Bean’s Café not to interfere in the fight; that Goh did not identify the first appellant who was armed with the knife that morning at the scene; that if Goh’s version of events were true, the police would have arrived by 2.30am instead of at 4.00am when they actually arrived; and that there were discrepancies between Goh’s evidence and the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses.
24        In my opinion, the points brought up by the first appellant did not show that the trial judge was plainly wrong in believing Goh’s evidence. It must be borne in mind that the whole incident happened in the early hours of the morning. There was a large crowd of people at the scene, the situation was chaotic, and it would have been difficult to distinguish one person from another. Given this state of affairs, one had to look at the whole picture in deciding whether a particular person’s testimony was credible. I had no doubt that this was what the trial judge did. The trial judge held in his grounds of decision ([1] 
supra
, at [148]) that: “On the totality of the evidence, I found that Goh Joo Kuan was a honest witness who had nothing to gain by falsely testifying against the [first appellant] and the others.” As the trial judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of Goh and was therefore in a better position to determine the credibility of Goh’s testimony, I was unable to hold that the trial judge was plainly wrong in believing Goh’s evidence. In any case, the discrepancies raised by the first appellant in relation to time and the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses were immaterial discrepancies which had no direct bearing on whether the first appellant had committed the offence. As I noted in 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 ([20] 
supra
), trial judges in such cases are perfectly entitled to find that discrepancies of this nature do not detract from the general veracity of prosecution witnesses on the material issues.
25        Another point raised by the first appellant was that the trial judge should not have relied on the statements of the fifth and sixth appellants in rejecting the first appellant’s defence that he was not at the scene during the fight, as the statements made by the fifth and sixth appellants were exculpatory statements. I agreed that the trial judge should not have relied on these statements, as s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) only allows confessions to be taken into consideration against co-accused persons. However, even without relying on these statements, the trial judge would still have been able to find that the first appellant was at the scene. Sgt Yeo and Goh both gave evidence that they saw the first appellant that night. Further, Sean Clinton was spotted at the scene by Sgt Yeo, Sergeant Peh Soon Wah (“Sgt Peh”)
[8]
 
and Daniel Vijay.
[9]
 
If the first appellant had really been with Sean Clinton at that time, as the first appellant had claimed, then the logical conclusion would be that the first appellant was also at the scene during the fight.
26        In addition, the first appellant’s arguments that the judge had erred in holding that the boot of Sean Clinton’s car was opened and some things were taken out, and in disbelieving that the first appellant had driven Sean Clinton’s car, were without merit. The points raised by the first appellant were not sufficient to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. In any case, these were not arguments that went towards the crux of the issue as to whether the first appellant had committed the offence.
27        The first appellant also appealed against his conviction on the charge of disorderly behaviour. He said that the court should not have relied on the evidence of Sergeant Mohd Ameer (“Sgt Ameer”)
[10]
 
and Sergeant Mohd Sarwani (“Sgt Sarwani”),
[11]
 
and that the evidence of Sergeant Quah Boon Keat (“Sgt Quah”)
[12]
 
that the first appellant was shouting loudly was questionable because none of the other officers had heard or noticed the first appellant’s behaviour. 
28        My response to this was that although Sgt Ameer’s evidence, that those present were rowdy and were shouting at the top of their voices, had indeed related to a period of time before the disorderly behaviour was alleged to have happened, this formed part of the background evidence that could be taken into account when deciding if the first appellant had committed the act in question. As for Sgt Sarwani’s evidence, although he was not able to identify the first appellant, he gave evidence that a male Indian person had shouted at Sgt Quah querying why he had to produce his personal particulars. He also gave evidence that this male Indian person was unco-operative and had ignored the police officers’ warnings to lower his voice. Sgt Sarwani’s evidence was substantially similar to that given by Sgt Quah. Therefore, the trial judge was not wrong to rely on Sgt Sarwani’s evidence to establish the fact that someone had indeed shouted at Sgt Quah, was unco-operative and did not heed the police officers’ warnings to lower his voice. With regard to Sgt Quah’s evidence, the fact that other officers did not notice the behaviour of the first appellant did not make Sgt Quah’s evidence any less reliable. Sgt Sarwani had testified in court that he could not hear what other suspects were saying to other officers, as everyone was shouting at the top of their voices. This was a good explanation as to why no one else had noticed the first appellant’s behaviour. Accordingly, I dismissed the first appellant’s appeal against his conviction for disorderly behaviour.
The second and fourth appellants
29        I dealt with the appeals of the second and fourth appellants together, as there were joint submissions for these two appellants. A number of grounds of appeal were raised, which could be divided into the following five broad categories.
30        The first argument put forth by these two appellants pertained to the charge. It was argued that the charge was amended to state that the appellants shared a common object to commit affray, and affray, by its very nature, was spontaneous. It did not require the formation of intent to cause hurt or damage. I found that this was a philosophical argument which did not make a real difference to the case and had no practical effect on the charge. It was also argued that the charge did not mention who the appellants had fought with, and as such, the charge was too vague and caused prejudice to the appellants. In my opinion, there was no prejudice, because the charge that the appellants had to meet was very clear. In order to escape conviction, it was clear that they had to show that there was no common object to commit affray. Even though the charge did not state the parties with whom they were alleged to have fought, the appellants would have known the charge they had to meet.
31        The second and fourth appellants also argued that the charge was flawed because it did not provide details about the alleged violence caused by the members of the illegal assembly. It was argued that as violence or harm is an important ingredient of the offence of rioting, the failure to state this in the charge threw the Prosecution’s contention that the accused persons had committed rioting into doubt, and this was prejudicial to the accused. At best, the ingredients of the charge only supported a charge under s 144 of the PC, which is the offence of joining an unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon.
32        It is not in dispute that a charge should state all the essential ingredients of an offence: 
Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 744
.  However, in my opinion, the argument raised by the second and fourth appellants was unmeritorious. The charge had stated that the appellants’ “common object was to commit affray, and in prosecution of the said common object, [they] were armed with deadly weapons…” Section 159 of the PC states that to commit affray is to fight in a public place and disturb the public peace. Violence is the essence of a breach of peace: 
Goh Ang Huat v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 570
. If so, the violence alleged was listed in the charge because violence is inherent in the very concept of committing an affray. Therefore, although a fight 
per se
 would not constitute the offence of rioting, an unlawful assembly which had a common object to commit affray and which used deadly weapons to achieve this object would have naturally used violence, and this would constitute the offence of rioting. This was reflected in the charge. Further, no prejudice was caused to the second and fourth appellants. Although specific details of the alleged violence were not stated in the charge, the charge that the appellants had to meet, which was that they had no common object to commit affray, was very clear.
33        The second argument brought up by the second and fourth appellants was that the evidence did not show that the accused persons shared a common object to attack Mohan and the staff of Mohican’s Pub. I did not accept this submission, because the appellants were charged with having a common object to commit affray. As such, the prosecution merely had to establish that the common object was to commit affray.
34        The third broad argument raised by the second and fourth appellants concerned evidence that was adduced from Mohan, Goh, Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh. In relation to evidence from Mohan, the trial judge had impeached Mohan’s testimony and substituted his oral evidence with his police statements pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. The second and fourth appellants contended that the Prosecution failed to establish why Mohan’s out of court statements should be preferred to his evidence in court. It was argued by the appellants that the Prosecution did not adduce evidence from Appu Rajah and Rajendran to contradict Mohan’s testimony that he had made his police statements based on their narrations of the events to him, and it was also argued that Mohan could very well have been briefed by Appu Rajah and Rajendran since the police statements were taken eight months after the event. In addition, it was argued that there were inconsistencies in Mohan’s statement because no one else but Mohan had testified that an axe was used. It was also argued that the Prosecution did not adduce any evidence from Vengadeswaran Gobi (“Gobi”)
[13]
 
to corroborate Mohan’s evidence that Gobi’s desire to resolve the dispute between the second appellant and himself was misinterpreted by the second appellant who called for backup.
35        In my opinion, the impeachment of Mohan’s testimony and the substitution of his oral evidence with his police statements was justified, as the trial judge had found that there were material discrepancies between Mohan’s oral evidence and his police statements, and had found that Mohan’s testimony was unreliable and his police statements were closer to the truth. The trial judge was not plainly wrong in preferring Mohan’s out of court statements to his oral testimony. Sergeant Vikneshwaran
[14]
 
had testified that he told Mohan to relate only what he saw, and Mohan had agreed. Taking this into account, it could not be said that it was plainly wrong for the trial judge to disbelieve Mohan’s testimony that his recollection of events was based on a narration by Appu Rajah and Rajendran. In relation to the point that no one else mentioned the axe, I noted that in the case of 
Osman bin Ramli v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 1
, I had observed that it would not be unusual for witnesses to come up with different accounts of the same event, particularly where the situation was chaotic and the time interval short. These were the circumstances in the present case. Hence, it was not unusual that different witnesses saw the appellants holding different weapons.
36        In relation to evidence from Gobi, I was of the opinion that Gobi’s evidence was similar to Mohan’s, although it was not identical. Gobi had stated that after the second appellant had argued with Mohan, he saw the second appellant making a telephone call to his father, and the second appellant was not happy when he spoke to his father. As such, I was of the view that the submission by the second and fourth appellants that Mohan’s police statements should not be used to substitute his oral testimony in court was unmeritorious.
37        The second and fourth appellants also objected to the trial judge’s reliance on the evidence of Goh, because there were major inconsistencies in Goh’s evidence. I had already addressed the issue of whether the trial judge had erred in relying on the evidence of Goh, and I was of the opinion that he had not. It could not be said that the trial judge’s evaluation of Goh’s evidence was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. In particular, the second and fourth appellants raised a point that was not dealt with earlier: that Goh had lied about his previous conviction and was not to be believed.
38        I was of the view that the fact that Goh had lied did not mean that his entire testimony was to be disbelieved. In 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
, [20] 
supra
, at [15], I had approved of the principle in 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
 that:
[t]here is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other.
Therefore, as the trial judge had the benefit of observing the demeanour of Goh on the witness stand and had concluded that, in totality, Goh’s evidence was credible, this finding of fact should not be disturbed.
39        Another objection raised by the second and fourth appellants was that the evidence of Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh showed that the appellants did not attack Mohan and the staff of Mohican’s Pub. The second and fourth appellants submitted that the evidence of Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh showed that the appellants were attacked by a group of ten men, and this group of aggressors was not in court. They argued that Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh were clearly unbiased witnesses, yet this important aspect of their evidence was ignored by the trial judge. I did not accept this submission, as the charge against the second and fourth appellants did not centre on an attack on Mohan and the staff of Mohican’s Pub, but that the appellants had a common object to commit affray. Therefore, even if they were attacked, the second and fourth appellants could still be convicted if they had the common object to commit affray. The point remained that the second appellant had indeed called the fourth appellant, and subsequently all the other appellants arrived at the scene. An inference could be made that they had the common object to commit affray. Further, it was not necessary to prove who the ten armed men were. What had to be proven was that there was a fight, and the appellants had participated in this fight. There was also nothing wrong with the trial judge picking parts of a witness’s testimony which he believed were closer to the truth. As such, the trial judge was not plainly wrong when he believed Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh’s evidence that the appellants had fought with a group of ten male Indians, while at the same time believing other witnesses’ evidence that weapons were used and that a large group of people arrived after the second appellant had called the fourth appellant.
40        The fourth submission brought up by the second and fourth appellants was that the lack of weapons seized and the lack of injuries showed that the appellants were not engaged in the fight. In my opinion, too much weight should not be placed on these factors. Various people had given evidence of weapons being used: Goh, Marc, and Daniel Vijay. Further, in Mohan’s police statement, Mohan had said that the second appellant told him that the weapons used in the fight were concealed in his car and his brother had driven the car away. This could be the explanation for the missing weapons. As for the lack of injuries, Mohan had testified in his police statement that he had been injured by a sharp object, which left a scar on his arm. Moreover, if indeed as the two appellants alleged, there were so many other people involved in the fight, these people could have been the ones who suffered injuries. In any case, for the charge under s 148 of the PC to be made out against the appellants, it was not necessary that the weapons were actually used to inflict injury. The fact that the appellants were armed with deadly weapons was sufficient to make out the charge: 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
 ([16] 
supra
).
41        The two appellants have also argued that the chopper was allegedly held by the sixth appellant, and the trial judge should not have taken this into account when deciding if the charge of rioting with deadly weapons was made out against them, especially since they were not armed with deadly weapons. I found this argument unmeritorious, because as I have mentioned earlier, by virtue of s 149 of the PC, so long as one member of an unlawful assembly was armed with a deadly weapon, the other members of the unlawful assembly could be liable for rioting under s 148 of the PC. I had stated this clearly in the case of 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
.
42        The fifth argument brought up by the second and fourth appellants was that the trial judge had failed to consider their evidence. A perusal of the trial judge’s grounds of decision shows that this was patently untrue. The trial judge had considered their evidence, but had come to the conclusion that they were untruthful in their account of the events. Accordingly, I dismissed the second and fourth appellants’ appeal against conviction.
The third appellant
43        The third appellant raised several grounds of appeal that I will deal with in turn. First, the third appellant argued that the trial judge’s finding, that he was not truthful when he said that the sixth appellant had left the food centre when the fifth appellant had arrived, was only a minor discrepancy that did not go towards the crux of the issue. My response to this was that while this was a minor issue, the trial judge could certainly take this factor into account in deciding if the third appellant’s version of events was true.
44        Second, the third appellant argued that the trial judge had erred in holding that he had gone with the first appellant and Sean Clinton to Mohican’s Pub earlier that night asking for a drink. In this respect, the third appellant questioned the reliability of Mohan’s statements. In my opinion, as Mohan’s testimony in court was impeached, weight should not be placed on what he said in court but on his police statements. In Mohan’s police statement, he had said that the third appellant was at the pub earlier that night. Rajendran had also given evidence to this effect.
 
45        The third and fourth submissions raised by the third appellant were that Goh’s evidence that the third appellant had chased someone with a knife, and his evidence that the third appellant had climbed over the front wall into the pub, should not be believed, as Goh’s evidence was contradictory. I have dealt with these points above and have found that these submissions were unmeritorious. In particular, I would reiterate that this incident happened in the early hours of the morning, there was a large group of people at the scene, and many of them would have been drinking before the incident took place. The situation was chaotic and confusing. In circumstances such as these, it would be expected that the evidence given by the witnesses was unclear. As such, it would not be right to nit-pick the evidence given by each witness. Instead, the whole picture had to be looked at in its entirety in deciding whom to believe. Even if inconsistencies in Goh’s testimony were observed when he was cross-examined, the trial judge had the advantage of observing Goh’s body language and demeanour in court, and he had come to the finding of fact that Goh was a credible witness. In these circumstances, I found that the trial judge’s finding of fact should not be overturned.
46        The fifth submission raised by the third appellant was that the trial judge had erred in holding that Sgt Peh had seen the third appellant together with Manogaran and the second, fourth and sixth appellants. In my opinion, the trial judge had indeed erred in making this finding of fact. Sgt Peh had not mentioned seeing the third appellant at all. This argument was related to the sixth submission that was raised, which was that the trial judge was wrong in holding that three persons had seen the third appellant actively participating in the riot. In my view, this finding of fact could not stand, in light of the fact that Sgt Peh had never said that he saw the third appellant at the scene. However, the trial judge was entitled to rely on Sgt Yeo and Goh’s evidence in holding that the third appellant had participated in the riot. The third appellant sought to throw doubt on Sgt Yeo’s evidence by pointing out the fact that Sgt Yeo had said that he could not recall when he saw the third appellant, but only recalled having seen him somewhere along Prinsep Street. However, in Sgt Yeo’s evidence-in-chief, he had said that the third appellant was part of a group of people creating a commotion along Prinsep Street. The trial judge was thus not plainly wrong in relying on Sgt Yeo’s evidence to convict the accused, as it was fully open to him to accept one part of Sgt Yeo’s testimony over another.
47        I found the next three submissions to be completely unmeritorious, and I disposed of them summarily. The seventh submission raised by the third appellant was that the trial judge had erred in holding that the third appellant had lied to Sgt Ameer that he was preparing for a fire-walking ceremony. I found that this was not a crucial point to the case of whether the third appellant had indeed committed the offence of rioting. The eighth submission was that the trial judge had erred in holding that the third appellant had lied in saying that he was drunk and had slept in the fourth appellant’s car. I found that this finding of fact was not plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence, as evidence was adduced from Mohan and Rajendran to show that the third appellant had gone to the pub earlier that night, and Goh and Sgt Yeo had seen the third appellant at the scene. The ninth submission, that the trial judge had failed to address the issue as to between whom the affray had been committed, was addressed above in [30]; the crucial factor was whether there was a common object to commit affray, and the trial judge had found that there was.
48        The tenth submission brought up by the third appellant was that the trial judge had erred in placing great weight on Mohan’s statement. It was argued that the contemporaneity of Mohan’s police statements was in issue, as the first police statement was made by Mohan only about ten months after the incident. However, my opinion was that a statement made ten months after the event was not necessarily unreliable. Cases frequently take such a length of time before they are heard in court, but weight can still be placed on the evidence given by witnesses. 
49        The last submission brought up by the third appellant was that the prosecution had not established that the third appellant formed part of an unlawful assembly, and that there was reasonable doubt that the third appellant was aware of or concurred in the common object. I found this submission to be without merit. The trial judge had accepted the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence that the third appellant was at the scene and had climbed over the front wall into Mohican’s Pub. The large group of people there that night, of which the third appellant was a member, would go towards proving that the third appellant was part of an assembly of five or more people. Further, the fact that the eight accused persons had ended up in Prinsep Street after their night out at JBFC, the fact that they were seen to be involved in various acts of fighting, as well as the fact that all the eight accused persons had later left the scene together, were facts from which an inference could be drawn that there was a common object to commit affray and the third appellant was aware of and concurred in this common object.
The fifth appellant
50        The fifth appellant raised four main points in his appeal against his conviction. The first argument raised was that the Prosecution had not established a 
prima facie
 case against him. This was because Mohan’s evidence did not in any way implicate him; Goh was a confused witness and his evidence was unreliable; the fifth appellant’s alleged “orchestration” of the fight was questioned; and the Prosecution had assessed the evidence on a set of primary facts but had called for the defence on an amended charge.
51        I did not accept these arguments. While Mohan’s evidence indeed did not implicate the fifth appellant, the trial judge had chosen to believe Goh’s evidence, and I did not think that I should overturn this finding of fact, as I had pointed out above. Goh’s identification of the fifth appellant was therefore good. Furthermore, it could not be said that the fifth appellant’s orchestration of the fight lacked the particulars which imputed his culpability in the fight. If there had been a fight going on, and a person had been seen “pointing here and there”, as Goh had testified, the reasonable inference would be that he had been telling the others what to do and that he had been orchestrating the fight. This would mean that the fifth appellant was involved in the commission of the affray. In addition, the fact that the word “orchestrate” was inserted by the police officer recording the statement, and was not the word that Goh had used, was not a relevant consideration. Goh had testified that the investigating officer had read the statement over to him before he agreed to it, and he had also testified that he understood everything in the statement when he signed it. As such, there was no objection to the fact that the word “orchestrate” did not originate from him.
52        In relation to the charge, there was nothing wrong with amending the charge at the close of the Prosecution’s case. In fact, it was said in 
Chin Siong Kian v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 72
 that it was at the close of the Prosecution’s case that the court was in the best position to decide exactly what was the case that the accused was required to meet. It was not the case, as the fifth appellant alleged, that the evidence was adduced by the Prosecution on a set of distinct primary facts while the defence was called on an amended charge with a distinctively different set of primary facts. A careful examination of the amended charge reveals that it was not substantially different from the original charge. As such, I did not accept the fifth appellant’s argument that the Prosecution had not established a 
prima facie
 case against him.
53        The second objection raised by the fifth appellant was that the trial judge had erred in placing too much reliance on the facts of his association with the other accused persons at JBFC, and that the gathering at JBFC was not an unlawful assembly. My view was that the trial judge had not erred in this respect. I had held in 
Lim Thian Hor v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
 at [19] that mere presence in an assembly of persons does not make an accused a member of an unlawful assembly unless there is direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared the common object of the assembly. From the fact that the fifth appellant was with the other accused persons at JBFC, the trial judge could have inferred that the fifth appellant had associated himself with the offending members, and the trial judge could have then inferred that the fifth appellant had shared the common object of the assembly and was thus a member of an unlawful assembly.
54        The third objection raised by the fifth appellant was that there was no evidence to show that he was at the vicinity of the pub where the fight had taken place. The fifth appellant admitted that he had been at the scene, but he said that he had merely been standing by the fourth appellant’s car and having a smoke as he waited to take a ride from the fourth appellant, and he had not been at the pub itself. In my view, the trial judge was entitled to believe Goh’s evidence that he saw the fifth appellant orchestrating the fight. Moreover, the trial judge was not wrong to make an inference that the fifth appellant was involved in the fight near the pub, based on the fact that the fifth appellant was present at the scene, as it was very unlikely that the fifth appellant was simply standing by one side surveying the scene when there were so many people fighting with weapons near him and he was running the risk of being injured by them.   
55        The fourth argument raised by the fifth appellant was that the trial judge had erred in drawing certain inferences on primary facts which were not adduced by the Prosecution. In my opinion, these objections were without merit. Although the trial judge had no direct evidence on these points, he was entitled to come to the conclusions that he did from the mass of evidence that was before him. In particular, I would highlight the fifth appellant’s objection to the trial judge’s holding that if there had been a fight, the fifth appellant must have shared the common object to commit affray. In my view, this was a reasonable inference of fact. As I have mentioned above, a person is a member of an unlawful assembly if he is aware of the common object and concurred in it. In the present instance, the facts were such that the group of accused persons was at JBFC drinking. After the call from the second appellant came, the appellants all went down to Prinsep Street. The appellants were spotted by various witnesses doing different things, and in particular, the fifth appellant was seen orchestrating the fight. In these circumstances, the inference that the fifth appellant had shared the common object to commit affray was sound.
The sixth appellant
56        The sixth appellant made many submissions which dealt mainly with findings of fact. I found all of these arguments to be unmeritorious. The sixth appellant’s first argument was that the trial judge had erred in accepting Mohan’s evidence when it was not contemporaneous in nature and was not conclusively substantiated. My short answer to this was that in convicting the sixth appellant, the trial judge had placed reliance on the evidence of other witnesses like Rajendran, Appu Rajah, Sgt Peh and Sgt Yeo. The trial judge had only used Mohan’s evidence to substantiate the other witnesses’ evidence that the sixth appellant was seen at the scene.
57        The sixth appellant’s second argument was that the trial judge had erred in finding that he had lied in his statement. His argument was that he was drunk at the time he made the statement, and he was oblivious to what had actually happened. In my view, the sixth appellant, by this argument, was admitting that his statement was unreliable. As such, there was no dispute here as the trial judge had similarly felt that his statement was unreliable.
58        The third argument raised by the sixth appellant, that he did not deny the fact that he was at JBFC and later at Prinsep Street, was similarly without merit. The trial judge had not held that the sixth appellant denied this fact. The trial judge had merely said that he did not believe that the sixth appellant was with Manogaran and the third, fourth and fifth appellants the whole evening, and had gone to Prinsep Street in the fourth appellant’s car. The reason for the rejection of this defence was that the sixth appellant was seen by witnesses arriving in a taxi on his own.
59        The fourth argument raised by the sixth appellant was that the trial judge did not consider that the sixth appellant had arrived in a taxi after the fight. In my view, this argument was unmeritorious. Rajendran and Appu Rajah had both testified that the sixth appellant had arrived after the police came for the second time. This was before the fight took place.
60        The fifth argument that was raised was that the trial judge had erred in concluding that Sgt Yeo’s evidence indicated that the sixth appellant had participated in the fight. I was unable to agree with this submission. Having gone through Sgt Yeo’s evidence, I found that the conclusion that the sixth appellant had participated in the fight was a reasonable one to draw, as Sgt Yeo had testified that he saw a commotion in which people in a group were talking in a hostile manner and gesturing, and that the sixth appellant was part of this group of people. As I have mentioned earlier, even though mere presence in a group does not make an accused a member of an unlawful assembly, there could be direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared the common object of the assembly: 
Lim Thian Hor v PP
 ([53] 
supra
). Therefore, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that the sixth appellant had associated himself with the group of people who were talking in a hostile manner and gesturing, and from there infer that he was a member of the unlawful assembly and had participated in the fight. 
61        The sixth submission of the sixth appellant was that the trial judge had erred in relying on Sgt Yeo’s and Sgt Peh’s evidence to conclude that the sixth appellant had climbed into Mohican’s Pub and smashed the glass panel with a beer barrel, as he did not take into account the inconsistencies between their statements and Goh’s statement. In my opinion, this finding by the trial judge was not against the weight of evidence. The weight of evidence actually supported the trial judge’s finding, because both Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh had testified that they saw the sixth appellant committing the act. Further, I did not accept the argument that Sgt Yeo and Sgt Peh were not credible witnesses, as the trial judge had the benefit of observing the demeanour of these witnesses and had come to the conclusion that they could be believed.
62        The next submission of the sixth appellant related to his conviction for criminal intimidation. It was argued that the trial judge had erred in accepting Goh’s and Marc’s evidence that they had identified the sixth appellant at the scene of the crime as the chopper-wielding assailant. In this regard, several inconsistencies were brought up. First, it was said that Marc’s evidence and Goh’s evidence were inconsistent, as Goh had testified that Marc was attacked whilst he was outside the car, whereas Marc had said that he was attacked when he was in the car. Second, the sixth appellant brought up the fact that both Marc and Goh could not recall the colour of the assailant’s shirt. In my opinion, the court should not place too much weight on this inconsistency in detail and the inability to furnish details about the colour of the assailant’s shirt. The incident had happened very quickly, and as held in 
Chean Siong Guat
 ([20] 
supra
), allowance must be given for human fallibility in observation and recollection of events.
63        Third, the sixth appellant argued that Marc had given inconsistent answers when asked if the car door had hit the assailant. My response to this was that this was an immaterial detail which had no direct bearing on the facts in issue, and little weight should be placed on this inconsistency.
64        In addition, the sixth appellant argued that Marc had told the policemen at the scene that he was attacked with a parang and not a chopper; that he had said that he was assaulted in front of Mr Bean’s Café; and that the policemen at the scene did not record any information about the identity of the assailant. While these consistencies might lead one to question whether Marc’s testimony could be believed, my view was that it was not possible to say that the trial judge was plainly wrong in believing Marc’s testimony. This was especially since Goh had given evidence to substantially the same effect. Given that the trial judge had the additional advantage of observing Marc’s and Goh’s demeanour, the trial judge’s finding of fact that the sixth appellant had attacked Marc should not be overturned. Accordingly, I found that there was sufficient evidence to convict the sixth appellant of criminal intimidation.
Appeal against sentence
65        The appellants have all appealed against the sentence that was imposed on them for the offence of rioting. In my opinion, the sentence of 36 months and six strokes of the cane imposed by the trial judge was not manifestly excessive, as there were various factors to indicate that this was a serious offence: violence was involved, deadly weapons were used, there was a certain amount of premeditation to commit affray, there was a large group of people, and the offence was committed in a public place that was relatively busy due to the large number of pubs and restaurants lining Prinsep Street which operate at night.
66        A comparison of this case with sentencing precedents would also reveal that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. An examination of the cases involving convictions under s 148 of the PC reveals that the courts have imposed heavier sentences on offenders than in the present case: see 
Toh Ah Chong v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 208 of 1994; 
Raj Kumar s/o Sivalingam v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 322 of 2000; and 
Mohamed Amirruddin v PP
 
[2002] SGDC 66
. In 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP
 ([16] 
supra
), I sentenced the offender to the relatively lighter punishment of two years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The facts in that case were that the assailants were armed with broken bottles and a parang, and they had attacked the victims because they were told to leave the back alley of the victims’ father’s shop. The victims suffered lacerations and a twisted ankle. In my opinion, the present case was more serious as the offence was committed at a public place with a greater number of people. Even though few injuries were reported in the present case, the damage done to the pub was comparable to the relatively minor injuries suffered by the victims in 
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak
. Hence, it was appropriate that a heavier sentence be imposed on the appellants in the present case. The sentence of 36 months and six strokes was thus not manifestly excessive.
67        I found that the mitigating factor brought up by the first appellant against the charge of rioting, which was that he was the sole breadwinner and financial hardship would be caused to his family, was not relevant. This was because financial hardship is only a mitigating factor in the most extreme of circumstances: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
.
68        The second appellant submitted that he was the owner of Mohican’s Pub and had invested considerably in the pub. I failed to see how this could be a mitigating factor in favour of the second appellant, especially when the second appellant had, through his own acts, caused damage to the pub. The fourth appellant submitted that he had a host of medical problems and ailments. I found that this factor was not relevant, because the cases have stated that ill-health would only be a mitigating factor in exceptional cases as an act of mercy, such as where the offender suffers from a terminal illness: see 
PP v Ong Ker Seng
 
[2001] 4 SLR 180
. The fact that these two appellants had no antecedents was also not relevant, because the presence of antecedents would lead to an enhanced sentence being imposed on them.
69        With regard to the third and fifth appellants, the same factor of the lack of antecedents was cited. The fifth appellant also brought up his medical problems. As stated above, these factors were not relevant. In addition, the fifth appellant argued that he was merely present at the scene and that there was no evidence to suggest that he participated in the affray, hence a lighter sentence should be imposed on him. As the evidence has shown that the fifth appellant was orchestrating the fight, I found that he was not merely a passive bystander and this argument therefore could not stand.
70        As for the sixth appellant, I found that his sentence of eight years of preventive detention and six strokes of the cane was not manifestly excessive, given that he had a whole string of antecedents. He had been imprisoned five times before for house-breaking, theft and various drug-related offences. He was a habitual offender, and a long sentence was merited in this case in order to protect the public from such a person. In addition, it was stated in his preventive detention report that he was in the moderate to high-risk group of re-offending, and it was recommended that he be sent for preventive detention. I thus found that his appeal against sentence should similarly be dismissed.
Conclusion
71        For the aforementioned reasons, all the appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The second and fourth appellants requested that their sentence be deferred by two weeks, so as to enable them to wind up their labour supply business and sort out their affairs. As this was a departure from normal practice, I decided to defer the sentence of only one of these two appellants. Accordingly, I ordered a two-week deferment of the fourth appellant’s sentence only.
Appeals dismissed.

Introduction
1          The accused person (“the Accused”) was charged with the following offences:
That you, [name of the Accused]
1ST CHARGE
sometime between 1998 and 1999, at Block 370 Tampines Street 34 #xx, Singapore, did voluntarily have carnal intercourse against the order of nature with [the alleged Victim’s name was stated and I will refer to her as “V”], female/12 years old, to wit, by forcing the said [V] to perform an act of fellatio on you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 377 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
2nd CHARGE
sometime between 1998 and 1999, at Block 370 Tampines Street 34 #xx, Singapore, did use criminal force on one [V], female/12 years old, intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by inserting an object into her vagina, and in order to facilitate the commission of the said offence, you voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the said [V], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Objection under section 159(1) Criminal Procedure Code
2          The Defence objected to the charges on the ground that it was vague in the light of s 159(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) which states:
The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if any, against whom or the thing, if any, in respect of which it was committed as are 
reasonably sufficient
 to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. [emphasis added]
3          The Defence pointed out that under s 159(2) CPC it is where the charge involves criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money that the charge may state the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed and this too is subject to a proviso that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.
4          The Defence also relied on some cases but I need mention three only, 
ie
, 
R v Mohamed Ali
 
[1933] MLJ 74
 (“
Mohamed Ali
”), 
PP v Yap Kok Meng
 
[1974] 1 MLJ 108
 (“
Yap Kok Meng
”) and 
Lim Chuan Huat v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 105
 (“
Lim Chuan Huat
”). The Defence submitted that the charges severely compromised the Accused who might otherwise be able to raise an alibi defence.
5          The Prosecution submitted that I should also take into account s 160 CPC, besides s 159. Section 160 states:
When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in sections 158 and 159 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.
6          The Prosecution submitted that it could only provide particulars as to the date of an offence in a charge if the victim were able to provide them. Here, V was not able to provide the date of the offence with any specificity. It submitted that s 160 recognises that there may be cases where such particulars will not be stated in the charge. The Prosecution also submitted that this was not the first time that a court had dealt with such charges. I list below some of the cases the Prosecution relied on:

7          In some of the cases listed above, the accused persons pleaded guilty whilst in others, trial was claimed. In any event, the point about vagueness of the charge was apparently not argued.
8          In my view, s 160 did not assist. From the illustrations given under the section, this section relates to cases where even with the particulars mentioned in s 159 (and s 158), the nature of the case is such that there is insufficient notice to the accused person of the matter with which he is charged. For example, illus (b) states:
A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.
9          As for the case of 
Lim Chuan Huat
, that pertains to a different point. In that case, each of two accused persons was charged with committing various offences within a period of about three months. I need refer only to the charge against Lim Chuan Huat to facilitate a better understanding of the judgment in that case. The charge read:
That you, Lim Chuan Huat, M/42 years, are charged that you on various occasions between the 5th day of March 1999 to the 11th day of June 1999, at Blk 295 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 2 #12-159, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Suprapti, F/27 years, to wit, by hitting her back, shoulders and hands with your hands and a rattan cane, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code Chapter 224.
10        It was in that context that Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that the charges were drafted in breach of s 159(1) CPC. At [20], he said:
In relation to the charges, I found the phrase ‘various occasions’ ambiguous. It shed no light at all on the exact number of occasions each appellant had allegedly caused hurt to the victim. The manner in which the charge was drafted also left the reader in doubt as to how each appellant had allegedly caused hurt to the victim. It was also unclear whether the nature of hurt inflicted by the appellants differed between each of these ‘various occasions’ or whether it was always the exact combination of acts as stipulated in the appellants’ charges. Taking Lim as an example, did he always cause hurt to the victim by hitting her on her back, shoulders and hands with his hands and a cane, or were there instances where he had only used a cane to hit the victim on her palms?
11        However, Yong CJ noted s 162 CPC and found that the appellant accused persons were not misled by the errors in their respective charges and therefore Yong CJ did not consider the errors to be material.
12        Accordingly, the point in that case was not whether the period between 5 March 1999 to 11 June 1999 (in the context of the charge against Lim Chuan Huat) was vague.
13        It is perhaps because of that case that in the present case the charge under s 377 Penal Code reflected only one offence and not various offences, even though the evidence which the Prosecution adduced suggested that the offences, if indeed committed by the Accused, had been committed perhaps five times. The Prosecution also confirmed in the trial that the charge under s 377 Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) related to the first of such offences.
14        As I have mentioned, the Accused also faced a second charge. The Prosecution confirmed that the second charge was in respect of the same occasion as the first charge.
15        Coming back to the point about vagueness arising from the period of two years, I refer to the case of 
Mohamed Ali
 where Terrell J said at 75:
The accused is the licensee of the Madras Cafe and was charged under Section 33(c) of Ordinance No 96 (Minor Offences) with having knowingly permitted prostitutes to meet and remain at the Cafe between 29th April and 7th June, 1931.
I should mention to begin with that I consider that the dates on which the alleged offence was committed are far too vague and that one or two specific dates should have been mentioned so as to enable the accused person to know the charge which he was called upon to meet.
16        In 
Yap Kok Meng
, Hashim Yeop A Sani J said at 109:
It is fundamental in the system of justice as we know it that a person accused of a criminal offence must be informed clearly of the charge made against him. The first charge in the instant case commences with the words “That you between 27 September 1972 at about 6.30 pm and 8.05 am 22 December 1972 at Batu 14 Kuala Lumpur-Ipoh Road, Rawang …”. These words are unclear and can be construed in various ways and to that extent the charge was badly drafted. The Criminal Procedure Code states in clear terms in section 153(i) that the charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if any, against whom or the thing, if any, in respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. Any charge which is not in conformity with this is bad. The fact that counsel for the accused had not drawn the attention of the learned President in the first instance will not alter the position. It is a fundamental rule that an allegation must be stated with sufficient precision to enable the accused to meet the allegation. I would also like to repeat the words of Adams J in 
Mee Lian Co v Public Prosecutor
 that it is also the duty of the court to see that a charge is properly drawn at the time it is read and explained to the defendant.
17        In Tan Yock Lin, 
Criminal Procedure
 (LexisNexis, 2004) vol 2, ch XIV, these two cases are mentioned with the following comments, at [654]:
These cases do not generalize to a proposition that any indication of a period of time within which the offence is alleged to have been committed results in a vague charge. In the first case [meaning 
Yap Kok Meng
], if the charge was true, there would have been possession at various times within the period indicated. Some instances of possession might have been lawful and the accused was entitled to know with which instance he was being charged. In the second case [meaning 
Mohamed Ali
], the charge as formulated was consistent with there having been various meetings at the place of the offence and the accused was entitled to know which specific event formed the basis of the charge.
18        Note 3 of [654] then states:
Cf
 
a charge that specifies that 
an
 offence of carnal intercourse against the order of nature was committed between January and March 1993, which was held in 
PP v Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim
 
[2001] 3 MLJ 193
 at 249 to be not vague. It was clear that only one act of carnal intercourse was being alleged. See also 
Ku Lip See v PP
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 194
 but the Federal Court appeared to have held that a charge alleging the commission of rape between May 1978 at or about 7 pm and June 1978 at or about 7 pm contained specific particulars that the offence was committed on 
both
 occasions at about 7 pm: at 195. There is an argument that a charge which does not specifically particularise the date of commission of the offence is not vague because such date is not material unless an essential part of alleged offence. But with respect, the requirements of s 160 … must not be overlooked. …
19        In 
Ratanlal & Dhirajlal’s The Code of Criminal Procedure
 (16th Ed, 2002), the following comments are made with respect to s 212(1) of the Indian Code which is 
in pari materia
 with s 159(1) CPC:
1. Scope —An accused person is entitled to know with certainty and accuracy the exact nature of the charge brought against him. Unless he has [this] knowledge he would be seriously prejudiced in his defence. However, where it is not possible for the prosecution to mention particulars precisely having regard to the nature of the information available to the prosecution, failure to mention such particulars may not invalidate the charge.
The case of 
Ranchhod Lal
 AIR 1965 SC 1248 is cited in footnote 32 as the authority for the last proposition but the actual authority for that proposition should be the case cited in n 31, 
ie
 
Chittaranjan Das
 AIR 1963 SC 1696.
20        I noted that s 159(1) CPC requires that such particulars as are “reasonably sufficient” to give an accused person notice of the matter with which he is charged are to be stated.
21        While it would be ideal if the time and date of an offence were stated in the charge, there may be occasions where a victim, especially a young victim, cannot remember the time and date of the offence. This will be all the more so if the victim does not mention the incident, whether out of fear or ignorance or some other reason, until much later.
22        Although it could be argued that an accused person would be prejudiced if the time and date of the offence were not stated because he might otherwise be able to raise an alibi defence, this argument would still apply even if the charge were to state that the offence was committed, say, in a particular month of a particular year. Such an argument, if valid, would mean that very few cases of sexual abuse against young victims would ever proceed to trial since young victims may not report sexual abuse immediately and their concept of time may be less reliable. Furthermore, the Defence did not suggest that a charge for an offence of sexual abuse said to be committed in a particular month of a particular year would be vague and prejudicial to an accused person.
23        In my view, the two charges framed did contain such particulars as to the time and place as was reasonably sufficient to give the Accused notice of the matter with which he was charged. As V was not able to give a more precise date or period of the offences, this would mean that her evidence had to be more carefully considered but that was another matter.
Trial within a trial (
voir dire
)
24        It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had given three statements to the police:
(a)        a statement on 5 September 2003 between about 12.00pm to about 1.00pm,
(b)        a statement on 5 September 2003 between about 2.35pm to 3.45pm, and
(c)        a cautioned statement on 5 September 2003 between 4.00pm to 5.00pm.
The Accused’s position was that the cautioned statement was recorded even before the statement mentioned in (a) above was recorded.
25        It was quite clear to me from the evidence, which I shall elaborate on later below, that the cautioned statement was recorded between 4.00pm to 5.00pm of 5 September 2003. I will therefore refer to the statements at (a) and (b) above as the “first” and “second” statements respectively, and the third statement at (c) above as “the cautioned statement”.
26        In the first statement, the Accused had admitted and described how he had caused V to perform fellatio on him although the time frame of the incident was said to be in the middle of 1997.
27        In the second statement, he mentioned that he caused her to perform fellatio in the living room of his flat at Block 370 Tampines Street 34 #02-07 (“the Tampines flat”). He said he had only asked her to suck his penis when he was asked whether he had indulged in other sexual acts with V.
28        The following charge was then read to the Accused by the investigating officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police Laurence Rajoo (“the IO”) with the aid of an interpreter:
You,
[name of the Accused], male 36 years old
D.O.B: 01/12/1966
Nric No. S1775961B
are charged that you, sometime between the year 1998 and 1999, at Blk 370 Tampines Street 34 #02-07, Singapore, had carnal intercourse against the order of nature with one [V], female 12 years old, D.O.B: 18 May 1991, to wit, by forcing the said [V] to perform an act of fellatio, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 377 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
29        In the cautioned statement, the Accused said:
The charge is true. But I want the sentence to be lenient because I am the sole bread winner. My wife is pregnant and I have 2 other children. My wife is not working. I will change to be a better person and will not do the same offence again. My army reservist is coming on 16/9/03 to 30/9/03. I wish to complete it.
30        The Defence challenged the admissibility of these three statements under s 122(5) CPC on the allegation that they had been procured by threats and inducements.
31        The Defence also challenged the admissibility of another statement made by the Accused on 11 September 2003 on the same grounds. On this occasion, the Accused had made a statement to his wife at his flat at Block 894C Woodlands Drive 50 #03-01, Singapore (“the Woodlands flat”) in the presence of three police officers above the rank of sergeant. He had asked for forgiveness from his wife for causing hurt to V. I will refer to this as “the fourth statement”.
32        The Defence claimed that there were threats and inducements on 4 and 5 September 2003 and those threats and inducements were still operating on the Accused’s mind on 11 September 2003. Accordingly, with the agreement of the parties, the 
voir dire
 for the fourth statement was conducted in the same 
voir
 
dire
 for the first and second statements and the cautioned statement. In the course of the 
voir dire
, the Accused also alleged he had been assaulted.
33        It was not disputed that on 4 September 2003, the IO and Senior Staff Sergeant Govindharajoo R (“SSSgt Govindharajoo”) had gone to the Woodlands flat at about 6.00am to ask the Accused to go with them to assist them in their investigations. It was also not disputed that the Accused wanted to wait for his father before going with the police officers but he was informed that his father could go to Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) where they would be bringing the Accused.
[1]
34        The Accused said that the police officers had knocked loudly at the door of his flat. However, they denied this, saying that they did not want to wake the neighbours up. The Accused also said that when he did not open the metal gate to the Woodlands flat initially, the police officers had threatened to summon the entire police force to break down the gate to the Woodlands flat and to let his neighbours know that he was being arrested.
[2]
 
The police officers denied saying this.
35        In any event, the Accused did go with the police officers to CID which was at Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”). The Accused claimed that on the way there, the patrol car driven by SSSgt Govindharajoo hit a taxi but the patrol car did not stop. This was denied by the police officers who accepted that there was an accident involving a taxi but that the patrol car was not involved in the accident. SSSgt Govindharajoo elaborated that from the point of police procedure, he could not just have driven off and he would also have had to make a report about the accident, if the patrol car he was driving was involved in an accident.
36        At about 6.45am, the Accused and the police officers arrived at CID. The IO brought the Accused to an interview room of the Serious Sexual Crime Branch (“SSCB”) on the 17th floor and interviewed him there.
37        At about 11.20am, the IO placed the Accused under arrest for an offence of rape and an unnatural offence under s 376(1) and s 377 of the Penal Code.
[3]
 
He then made an arrest report and handed the Accused over to the lock-up of Central Police Division at PCC at about 11.45am.
[4]
38        In the evening of 4 September 2003, the Accused was brought out of the lock-up at 6.55pm for another interview by the IO at an interview room on the 17th floor of SSCB. He was brought back to the lock-up at 10.05pm that day.
[5]
39        The Accused said that SSSgt Govindharajoo was present throughout the interviews in the morning and afternoon of 4 September 2003 but both the police officers said SSSgt Govindharajoo was present from time to time only as he was walking in and out of the interview room.
40        The Accused said that on 4 September 2003, the police officers kept on pressing him to admit he had done something wrong to a girl.
[6]
 
However he was not told the identity of the victim or the nature of the offence.
41        As for the identity of V, the Accused shifted his evidence. He said he was given the full name of V in the evening of 4 September 2003 but the name did not ring a bell.
[7]
 
Subsequently, he said that her full name was mentioned in the morning of 5 September 2003 after he had been interviewed by the IO and SSSgt Govindharajoo.
[8]
 
It was on his way to a lock-up thereafter that he began to realise that that was the name of V.
[9]
42        The Accused denied that he had been talking about his sexual relationship with V’s mother on 4 September 2003. He said he only mentioned this to the IO on 5 September 2003 before the interview in a room behind the lock-up had taken place.
[10]
43        The Accused also said that during the evening interview of 4 September 2003, he was made to stand in a corner of an interview room at the SSCB with his hands handcuffed behind him. SSSgt Govindharajoo had repeatedly told him he had better admit to what he had done to a girl.
44        The IO was seated in a chair with his legs on a table. At one point, the IO stood up, banged his hand on the table and said words to the effect that everyone whom he had brought to the room had admitted to their crime and the Accused had better admit also. Thereafter, SSSgt Govindharajoo suddenly swung his right hand forward to slap the Accused. The Accused was shocked but managed to avoid the full force of the slap which hit his nose causing his spectacles to drop down his nose. The tip of his nose was painful.
[11]
 
The Accused also said that after the IO had banged his hand on the table and threatened the Accused to make an admission, the IO seated himself and put his legs on the table again and shouted words to the effect that he would put the Accused’s wife in a lock-up and she could give birth in a lock-up. Also, the Accused would be blamed for all the rape cases in Woodlands.
45        The Accused initially said that at the evening interview of 4 September 2003, he did ask for permission to see his wife before giving a statement.
[12]
 
However, he changed his evidence to simply requesting to see his wife and father but without mentioning that he would make a statement thereafter.
[13]
46        The Accused also said that during the evening interview on 4 September 2003, SSSgt Govindharajoo had told him in a soft tone that he would arrange for the Accused to see his wife and father and that his wife could also bring food to him, if he made an admission.
[14]
47        As I have mentioned, the Accused was brought to Alexandra Hospital in the morning of 5 September 2003 for a pre-statement medical examination. The doctor who examined him did not notice any physical injury on the Accused who had complained about a chronic back pain. The Accused said he did not complain about the events of 4 September 2003 because of the presence of two or three other escorting officers in the same room as the doctor and him.
48        The Accused said that after he had come back from the pre-statement medical examination, he was taken up to an interview room again. The IO and SSSgt Govindharajoo were present and they interviewed him again for one to two and a half hours.
[15]
 
They again asked him to admit to having done something to a child and the IO mentioned the full name of V but the Accused said he did not know her and denied doing anything to the child. He said the threats about locking up his wife till she gave birth in the lock-up and putting the blame for all the rape cases in Woodlands were repeated. The IO had also said that the IO would not allow him to see his wife and father until he made an admission.
[16]
 
Up till then, he was still not told the offence which he was to admit to.
49        The Accused said that he was then brought to the lock-up and shortly thereafter he was brought to an interview room behind the lock-up for the recording of a statement by the IO. An interpreter, Ms Masdiana Ramli, was present too.
50        The Accused also said that when the second statement was recorded, the interpreter was someone else other than Ms Masdiana. The Accused said that since he was not wearing his glasses then, it seemed to him that the interpreter for the second statement had a different figure, looked different and had a different voice.
[17]
 
She appeared pregnant.
[18]
 
When the Accused was asked whether he was referring to another interpreter by the name of Sapiahtun Mohd Ali who had interpreted other statements to him after 5 September 2003, the Accused said he did not know this name. He also said that he was not sure whether Ms Sapiahtun had interpreted statements to him after 5 September 2003
[19]
 
but he remembered clearly that she was the interpreter who had interpreted the second statement to him.
[20]
51        When it was pointed out to the Accused that Ms Masdiana’s name was recorded at the top of the first page of the second statement as being the interpreter and her signature appeared on every page of that statement, the Accused said that when he signed the second statement, including the first page thereof, the top part or heading of the first page was blank. He noticed this because as he was not having his glasses on, he was more careful when he signed.
[21]
 
He also said that the interpreter of the second statement did not sign on it, thus suggesting that it was signed later by Ms Masdiana who was not the interpreter for this statement.
[22]
52        Likewise, when the first page of the first statement showing the venue of the interview to be on the 17th floor at an SSCB interview room and not at an interview room behind a lock-up, the Accused said that when he signed the first statement, including the first page, the first page was blank.
[23]
53        Coming back to the time on 5 September 2003 just before the Accused had given any statement, the Accused’s evidence was that when Ms Masdiana was present, he told her that he had not done anything but she responded that if he had not done anything, he would not be there.
[24]
54        The Accused also said that he had declined to sign the cautioned statement three times. However, he signed it because the IO had instructed the interpreter to coax him to sign it and she did.
[25]
 
At that time, he was scared and worried for his family including his pregnant wife who was due to deliver at any time and his children and job.
[26]
 
Subsequently, he added that it was because of all the threats and inducements on 4 and 5 September 2003 that he signed all the three statements.
[27]
55        As for the post-statement medical examination which was done after 5.00pm of 5 September 2003, the Accused said that again he did not disclose the threats and inducements to the doctor because of the presence of escorting officers.
[28]
56        On 11 September 2003, the Accused was brought to the Woodlands flat for a search to be done. On this occasion, he knelt down before his wife and asked her for forgiveness for what he had done to V. As I have said, the voluntariness of this statement was also challenged by the Accused.
57        The Accused’s version was that while he was brought out of the lock-up on 11 September 2003 before making the trip to the Woodlands flat, the IO had told him that he could not talk to anyone in the flat. The IO had also said that if he wanted to talk to his wife, he must ask her for forgiveness for having caused hurt to V.
[29]
 
This was allegedly repeated by the IO just before they entered the flat. The Accused then said that he decided to speak to his wife and ask her for such forgiveness because the IO instructed him to do so and he was in fear because of the events on 4 and 5 September 2003.
[30]
 
He said that he wanted to say something else to his wife after he had sought her forgiveness but did not do so because someone pulled him back. Shortly after that, one of the police officers told him to say what he liked to his wife but he refrained from doing so as he remembered that he had been told that he was only to ask for forgiveness from his wife.
[31]
58        The Accused said that he did subsequently complain about being forced to give statements on 5 September 2003. The complaint was made to Dr Tommy Tan at Changi Prison Hospital the next day after the Accused was brought to the Woodlands flat.
[32]
 
The Accused said he informed Dr Tan that he was told to admit to something he had not done. He was slapped and threatened that his wife would be put in a lock-up and made to give birth there. He would be blamed for all the rape cases in Woodlands.
[33]
 
He also told Dr Tan that he had been worried about his family as he was the sole breadwinner and especially about his wife who was due to give birth on 12 or 13 September 2003.
[34]
 
As it turned out, the Accused’s wife had already given birth before 11 September 2003 but he did not know this until 11 September 2003. The Accused also told Dr Tan that he could not sleep, he was thinking about his predicament and had lost his appetite.
[35]
59        The Defence called Dr Tommy Tan as its second witness for the 
voir dire
. Dr Tan was a consultant psychiatrist who was attached to Woodbridge Hospital at the time he gave evidence for the 
voir dire
. He had examined the Accused on three occasions: on 23, 26 and 30 September 2003 at the old Changi Prison Hospital in order to produce a psychiatric report on the Accused. He had made contemporaneous case notes of what the Accused had told him. I state below Dr Tan’s evidence as to what the Accused had told him based on his case notes.
60        On 23 September 2003, the Accused told Dr Tan that the policeman would slap him if he did not confess. The policeman did not slap him. The Accused had kept telling the police that he did not do anything wrong.
[36]
61        On 26 September 2003, the Accused told Dr Tan that the police said he had committed the alleged offence in 1998 or 1999 and it was committed in his previous residence at the Tampines flat. He had emphasised to them that he did not commit the offence. He said he had made a confession to the police. He was under stress. He was not allowed to talk or see his family. The police threatened to slap him but did not do so. He said he confessed because he was scared. A female police officer kept asking him repeatedly if he had committed the offence.
[37]
62        Dr Tan said that the Accused had said he was under stress and was scared because the female officer had repeatedly questioned him and the police had threatened to slap him. However the Accused did not name the police officers who had interviewed him.
[38]
63        On 30 September 2003, the Accused did not tell Dr Tan anything else about what happened to him while he was in police custody.
64        Dr Tan had noted in a medical report dated 1 October 2003 that when he had examined the Accused, the Accused had symptoms of depression. That report said that the Accused had said that his appetite was not good and his sleep was disturbed, as he was worried about his family. The Accused had said his mood was low. He spoke in an anxious tone.
65        There was no record in Dr Tan’s case notes that the Accused had informed him of any of the following:
(a)        that the Accused was in fact slapped by the police,
(b)        that the police had threatened to put his wife in a lock-up and make her give birth there,
(c)        that the police had threatened to blame all the rape cases in Woodlands on the Accused.
66        Dr Tan’s evidence was that if he had not written down such allegations, it meant that probably the Accused had not mentioned them to him.
[39]
 
Dr Tan also said that when the Accused was examined by him on all three occasions, the Accused was not wearing spectacles but he did not appear confused.
[40]
 
However, he was squinting.
[41]
67        The third and last witness for the defence in the 
voir dire
 was the Accused’s wife, “W”. She said that on 11 September 2003, after the Accused had asked her for forgiveness for what he had done to V, he was pulled back by an officer before he could say any other word.
[42]
 
The Accused had looked frightened, worried and scared when he had asked for forgiveness.
[43]
68        She said that thereafter, she met the Accused on 6 October 2003 at Queenstown Remand Prison.
[44]
 
The Accused had informed her that he had been forced to ask for forgiveness. He had mentioned the name of the officer but she could not recall the name. The Accused had said that he was threatened in that if he did not seek her forgiveness, he would be blamed for all offences in Woodlands. Also, she would be put in a cell to give birth to their third child. She could not recall whether her husband had ever mentioned that he would be slapped.
[45]
 
In cross-examination, she said that the Accused did tell her that the police had hit him on his nose and that the police had tried to slap him.
[46]
69        The evidence for the Prosecution was that SSSgt Govindharajoo was walking in and out of the interview room on the 17th floor on 4 September 2003 and he was not present throughout the interview. The IO and he said that the Accused was told of the nature of the offences, 
ie
 rape and unnatural offence, and the name of V on 4 September 2003. They agreed that throughout 4 September 2003, the Accused denied having committed such offences. They denied all the Accused’s allegations of threats, assault and inducement. They said that during the interviews on 4 September 2003, the Accused had been going on about his relationship with V’s mother and he was remorseful about this. The Accused had said that he wanted to meet his wife before giving a statement. However, he was not allowed to do so.
70        On 5 September 2003, the Accused was brought to Alexandra Hospital in the morning for a pre-statement medical examination. He was brought back to PCC and handed over to the IO at an interview room of SSCB at about 11.47am. SSSgt Govindharajoo was not present and there was no interview before the recording of the first statement.
71        The information recorded on the first statement indicated that the recording of the statement started at 12.00pm and ended at 1.00pm. The information recorded on the second statement showed that the recording started at about 2.35pm and ended at 3.45pm. The information from both the first and second statements revealed that the recording was done at room #17-06 of SSCB, which was on the 17th floor, and not in a room behind a lock-up. The name of the interpreter for both these statements was recorded as Ms Masdiana. Her signature was found on every page thereof. Likewise her signature was found on every page of the charge and cautioned statement and there was information thereon that the recording thereof was from 4.00pm to 5.00pm. The evidence from the IO and Ms Masdiana was that the cautioned statement was also recorded at the same interview room as the first and second statements.
72        The IO and Ms Masdiana said that she was the interpreter for all these three statements which were recorded in the interview room of SSCB on the 17th floor and not at an interview room behind the lock-up. Ms Masdiana denied that the Accused had told her before the recording of any of these statements that he did not do anything. She also denied that she had responded that if he had not done anything, he would not be there. The evidence for the prosecution was also that the Accused was wearing his spectacles when these three statements were recorded.
73        After these three statements were given, the Accused was brought to Alexandra Hospital for a post-statement medical examination.
74        It was common ground that he did not complain to either of the doctors at the pre-statement and post-statement medical examination of any threat, assault or inducement.
75        As regards 11 September 2003 when the Accused was brought to the Woodlands flat for a search, the IO denied that he had told the Accused that he could not speak to anyone without his permission.
[47]
 
However, SSSgt Govindharajoo remembered the IO saying that. On the other hand, SSSgt Govindharajoo and a third escorting officer Inspector B Burhanudeen HJ Hussanair (“Insp Burhanudeen”) did not hear the IO telling the Accused that if he wanted to speak to his wife, he had to ask for forgiveness for what he had done to V. The IO denied this allegation too. Insp Burhanudeen said that it was an emotional scene when the Accused knelt down and asked for forgiveness from his wife. The Accused was crying and the inspector himself was teary while kneeling or squatting beside the Accused then. These three officers denied that after the Accused had knelt down and asked for forgiveness from his wife for having caused hurt to V, he was pulled away before he could say anything else to the wife.
76        I was of the view that the IO and SSSgt Govindharajoo had not knocked on the door of the Woodlands flat unduly loudly at 6.00am of 4 September 2003. They were mindful that to do so might wake the neighbours up. I was also of the view that they were not so foolish as to threaten to summon the entire police force to break down the metal gate or to let the neighbours know that he was being arrested. If made, such a threat might have been heard by other members of the Accused’s family or neighbours. I was also of the view that the patrol car in which the Accused was driven from the Woodlands flat to PCC that morning did not hit a taxi and was then driven off. I accepted that if there was such an accident, a report would have to be made by the police officers who would also have to stop and not just drive off.
77        In any event, the allegations of the Accused about all these incidents before he reached PCC that morning were of peripheral relevance on the issue of the credibility of the IO and SSSgt Govindharajoo. It was not the Accused’s position that these alleged incidents caused him to make the four statements. It seemed to me that the purpose of these allegations was also to paint the picture of bullying police officers who were in a rush to get their hands on him to extract a confession from him.
78        I was also of the view that in the morning of 4 September 2003, the Accused must have been informed about the name of V and the nature of the offences alleged against him, 
ie
 the offence of rape and unnatural offence, although it was not clear to me whether fellatio had been specifically mentioned to him then. It would have been pointless for the police to try and obtain information from him without telling him the name of V and something about the alleged offences. I also did not believe the Accused’s evidence that while he did ask what the offences were about, he was too confused to ask who the victim was. I rejected the Accused’s evidence that the full name of V was mentioned only the next day. His evidence on this point had shifted as I have mentioned. I also did not accept his evidence that when that name was mentioned, he did not initially realise who she was.
79        I would add that even if fellatio had not been specifically mentioned to the Accused on 4 September 2003, the fact of the matter was that on 5 September 2003, he was giving statements about fellatio.
80        As regards the main issue, 
ie
 whether the alleged threats, assault and inducement had occurred, the Accused’s own witness Dr Tommy Tan put the lie to the Accused’s evidence that he had disclosed the alleged threats and assault to Dr Tan. Also, the Accused did not complain to Dr Tan that he was induced to make a confession with the inducement being that he would be able to see his wife and father. Furthermore, the Accused’s complaints to Dr Tan mentioned a female police officer but, for the 
voir dire
, there was no complaint about a female police officer. Dr Tan’s evidence demonstrated the extent to which the Accused was prepared to fabricate his evidence. I found that the Accused’s allegations about the threats, assault and inducement had been fabricated. Furthermore, while he might well have hoped to see his wife and father, that was different from an allegation of inducement by the police.
81        I also noted that the Accused had to be prompted by defence counsel before he said that he made the first three statements as a result of the threats and assault.
[48]
82        I did not accept the Accused’s evidence that after he had been brought back from the pre-statement medical examination in the morning of 5 September 2003, he was brought first to an interview room on one of the upper floors, and then brought back down to the lock-up and then brought out again but this time to an interview room behind the lock-up. Again the documentary evidence which the Prosecution relied on showed that after the Accused was brought to the 17th floor, the first statement was recorded on the 17th floor at SSCB. The second statement was also recorded at the same floor. I did not accept the Accused’s allegation that certain parts of the first and second statements were blank when he signed them. These allegations were not raised with the IO and the interpreter during cross-examination. Also, it seemed to me that the Accused had come up with evidence about the interview being conducted in a room behind the lock-up to cast doubt on the overall credibility of the IO and Ms Masdiana.
83        As for the Accused’s allegation that he had told Ms Masdiana that he had not done anything and she had replied that if he had done nothing, he would not be there, I was of the view that the Accused had again fabricated his evidence, this time to attack Ms Masdiana’s credibility as she was the interpreter for the first three statements. His evidence that she was not the interpreter for the second statement was also to attack such credibility but it was contradicted by documentary evidence. Also, Ms Masdiana’s evidence was steady throughout whereas the Accused’s was not. It was also telling against the Accused that he claimed at one stage that as he did not have his spectacles with him during the recording of the three statements, he could not see the second interpreter clearly. Yet he could see the IO’s face clearly enough to tell that the IO was staring at him when he allegedly told Ms Masdiana that he had not done anything. I did not accept the Accused’s explanation that the interpreter was further away from him than the IO. All three were in the same interview room and the interpreter would not have been much further from the Accused, if at all, as she had to interpret the IO’s questions to the Accused and the Accused’s responses to the IO.
84        As for the Accused’s allegation that he had declined to sign the cautioned statement three times but the IO had instructed the interpreter to coax him to sign it and she did, this allegation was not raised with the IO or the interpreter during cross-examination. In my view, it was a further fabrication by the Accused.
85        I also did not accept that the Accused was not wearing his spectacles on 5 September 2003 during the recording of his three statements. He was wearing them on 4 September 2003 at an interview room on the 17th floor and there was no reason why he should be deprived of them on 5 September 2003 when he was being interviewed again on the 17th floor.
86        It seemed to me that the Accused had said he did not have his spectacles with him on 5 September 2003 to paint the picture that he was disoriented and hence more susceptible to threats and inducements. Yet, as I have mentioned above, it was his own evidence that although he did not have his glasses, he was more careful when he signed the second statement. Thus his allegation about not having his spectacles no longer assisted him with the picture he was hoping to paint.
87        As regards the fourth statement, I was of the view that the IO did tell the Accused that he could not speak to anyone at the Woodlands flat without the IO’s permission. SSSgt Govindharajoo had recalled this. However, that was not the crux of the Accused’s allegation. The crux was that the IO had said that if the Accused wanted to speak to his wife, he would have to seek her forgiveness for causing hurt to V. I saw no reason for the IO to say that because on 5 September 2003, the Accused had already confessed to a charge involving fellatio. Secondly, the Accused did not explain initially why he chose to speak to his wife if he had to comply with such a condition. He could have simply remained silent. He then shifted his evidence by saying that he was instructed by the IO to ask for forgiveness.
[49]
 
In my view, the Accused was overcome by emotion after carrying his third child who had just been born and whom he had not seen before. He then blurted out his request for forgiveness. This was reinforced by the evidence of Insp Burhanudeen who was the police officer closest to the Accused at the time the Accused sought his wife’s forgiveness. Insp Burhanudeen said he himself was emotionally affected.
[50]
 
As I have mentioned, Insp Burhanudeen and the other two officers there had also denied that the Accused was pulled back after he had sought forgiveness. I was impressed by the inspector’s overall candour and I accepted this evidence of his as well.
88        In summary, I found that the alleged threats, violence and inducement had not occurred. The Prosecution had proved that each of the four statements had been given voluntarily for the purpose of s 122(5) CPC. Accordingly, I ruled that the four statements were admissible in evidence.
Formal facts
89        M is a divorcee. She has three children, 
ie
 two sons and V, with V being the youngest child. V was born on 18 May 1991. She would have been about seven years old in 1998 and about eight years old in 1999. In so far as the two charges were referring to the age of V as 12 at the time of the offences, this was incorrect. However, there was no prejudice to the Accused as V’s date of birth was not disputed. The Accused was born on 1 December 1966. He would have been about 32 years old in 1998 and about 33 years old in 1999.
90        V’s mother, M, is the aunt of W, the wife of the Accused whom the Accused married in 1994. Therefore W is the cousin of V. Accordingly, it would not be accurate to refer to the Accused as the uncle of V. However, probably because of the age difference between V and the Accused, V referred to the Accused as her uncle. I mention this only to avoid any confusion. There was no suggestion of mistaken identity or prejudice to the Accused arising from V referring to the Accused as her uncle.
Evidence for the Prosecution
Evidence of the victim
91        V could not remember exactly when she had been to the Tampines flat alone with the Accused. She believed it was between 1998 and 1999 although she was less certain about having gone there with him in 1999.
[51]
 
She believed it must have been on a Saturday or Sunday as she did not play truant from school. She was attending the afternoon session in a primary school in those years and had attended religious classes in the morning on some weekdays.
[52]
 
She was supposed to have gone to the Tampines flat to play with the Accused’s first born daughter.
[53]
 
She had gone with the Accused on a number of occasions but could not remember how often.
[54]
92        On the first occasion, the Accused had brought V into the master bedroom and asked her to take a bath. After she did so, he wrapped her in a towel and blindfolded her. He then carried her on the bed and placed her on it facing upwards. He tied her hands to the side of the bed. Then she felt something inserted into her private part. Thereafter he untied her hands and told her to sit on the floor. Something was put into her mouth and she was told to suck it. At that time, she was still blindfolded. The blindfold was subsequently removed. The Accused told her to change and thereafter he fetched her home.
[55]
 
Her home was also at Tampines. Each time she went alone with the Accused to the Tampines flat, his wife and daughter were not present.
[56]
93        V said that the object that was inserted into her private part felt big and caused her pain. It was moving in and out. She cried but did not struggle or ask the Accused to stop. He told her not to cry. The object that was inserted into her mouth was long hard and watery. She did not feel any pain then. She did not like the taste of the object in her mouth.
[57]
 
She believed the object inserted into her mouth was his private part.
[58]
 
She said she felt sad on the same day after the first occasion and cried at home before she slept.
94        She did not tell her mother about what happened to her because she did not know that what had happened to her was wrong and she was afraid she might not be believed.
[59]
 
She did not know what to say.
[60]
 
She agreed that the Accused did not threaten or bribe her to keep the matter a secret.
[61]
95        V remembered an instance when she, M and the Accused were in the Accused’s car. He had dropped M at Tampines Interchange where M would usually take a bus to a mass rapid transit (“MRT”) station. After M had been dropped off, V was brought to the Tampines flat. There something was inserted into her private part and she had to suck his private part. She had wanted to tell M that she did not want to go with the Accused but was afraid to do so as he was in the car too.
[62]
 
However, when V got back home, she did not mention to M or her father that she was reluctant to go with the Accused. She said she did not know why she did not tell either of them then.
[63]
 
V thought that this incident was probably after the first instance of such acts.
96        V did not realise that what the Accused had done was wrong until 2002 when she was in Primary Five. She had received sex education and was taught menstruation then. Her teacher had said that when a man inserts his private part into a girl’s and does not ask for her permission, that is wrong.
[64]
 
Thereafter she mentioned what the Accused had done to two of her best friends separately in 2003. I will refer to these two girl friends as “H” and “Myg”. They were her classmates in 2002 and 2003. By 2004, V was in the normal stream of secondary school. H remained V’s schoolmate in secondary school in 2004 but Myg was no longer in the same school as V in 2004.
Evidence of H and Myg
97        H said that V had mentioned to her on 8 August 2003 that V had to suck her uncle’s private part and something had been inserted into V’s private part. V had also said that she was blindfolded and her hands were tied. V said this had happened about five times.
[65]
 
V looked sad as she was narrating the incident to H. H calmed her down and advised her to tell her parents but V was afraid to do so.
[66]
 
Although the conditioned statement of H did not say that V had told H that V was made to suck her uncle’s private part, I accepted H’s oral evidence that she was told this although in cross-examination she accepted that perhaps V was not so sure about what she was made to suck.
[67]
 
I found H’s evidence to be generally steady. H also said that she could not remember whether she attended any sex education class but she remembered they were taught about menstruation.
[68]
98        Myg said V had mentioned to her on or about 11 August 2003 that her uncle had raped her. There was no mention by V to Myg of any other act of sexual abuse. V told Myg she was ashamed to tell her parents. She looked sad and was close to tearing. Myg advised her to inform her parents immediately.
[69]
 
Myg remembered that they were taught a little bit about sex in primary school but she could not remember which year it was taught.
[70]
Evidence of M
99        I now come to the evidence of V’s mother, M.
100      On 24 August 2003 at about 8.15pm, V and M were going to Block 125 Bedok North Street 1 for a religious class. While they were in a taxi, V said she had something to tell M. Upon being pressed further, V said it was about adultery. M told V they could discuss the subject after the religious class. The class ended at about 10.00pm and during the journey back, M questioned V further. V asked whether M remembered Uncle DU, meaning the Accused, and the period when V spent some time at the Tampines flat. M remembered that between 1998 and 1999, the Accused had asked for V to come over to play with his first child who was an infant then. The Accused had fetched V from her residence to the Tampines flat. At that time, V was staying with her parents in the Tampines neighbourhood as well.
101      V told M that when she was in the Tampines flat with the Accused, he had instructed her to remove her clothes and to shower in the master bedroom toilet. He would then carry her, put her on his bed, blindfold her and tie her hands to the side of the bed. V further said that she would feel pain at her private part as if something hard was entering her vagina. V said the hard object was inside her vagina for a long time and after removing it from her vagina, the Accused would untie her. Thereafter, he would instruct her to sit on the floor beside him and make her perform what M believed to be oral sex on him. After removing her blindfold, the Accused would ask her to wear her clothes and then send her home. M asked V how many times the Accused had done such acts and she replied that it was on five different occasions.
102      When they arrived home at about 11.00pm, M called her sister who was the mother-in-law of the Accused and told her what the Accused had done. Subsequently, she also told her ex-husband about the matter.
103      On 25 August 2003, after V returned from school, M and her ex-husband brought V to the Tampines Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a police report.
104      M’s evidence was that she had cautioned V about telling lies. V maintained that what she said was true. She also told M that she kept the incident away from her because she was afraid to reveal it and she also did not understand what the accused had done to her. The reason why V decided to tell M was because her friends advised her to do so.
105      M had stayed initially in a flat at Block 872 Tampines Street 84. In December 1999, she signed an agreement to sell this flat. After completion of that sale, she moved to a rented flat at Bedok Reservoir and stayed there for three months. Thereafter she moved to another flat which she had purchased at Block 933 Tampines Street 91. Whenever M moved, V would move along with her as well.
106      In 1995 or 1996, M had allowed V to go out with W and her husband, the Accused. At that time, W and the Accused were staying in the Tampines flat.
107      Sometime between 1996 and 1997, the Accused had an affair with M after he had invited her and brought her to the Tampines flat. The affair occurred in the Tampines flat. Since then, M did go to the Tampines flat but not when the Accused was alone.
108      V’s father had been unemployed since 1989 because of his heart condition except for 2000 when he had to get a job as a security guard because M had cancer. In 1998 and 1999, it was V’s father who would accompany her downstairs daily to wait for the school bus. At times when V was not attending school in the morning, V would be attending religious classes at a mosque. She attended the mosque twice a week on weekdays.
[71]
 
Based on this evidence, M deduced that the Accused must have fetched V to the Tampines flat to play with his daughter on a Saturday or Sunday.
[72]
 
It was she who had brought V down to the car park to await the Accused (NE 223). However, M recalled, after being reminded recently by V, that there was one Saturday when the Accused had picked up both M and V, dropped M at a Tampines MRT station and then went off alone with V to the Tampines flat. V had told M recently that on this occasion she had wanted to tell M that she did not want to accompany the Accused but had failed to tell M.
[73]
109      M denied that after her sexual encounter with the Accused and while she was leaving the Tampines flat, she had warned him not to reveal the incident to anyone, otherwise she would get him into trouble.
[74]
 
She also denied that on 4 September 2003, she had told W and the Accused’s parents at the lobby of PCC (see para 35) that she had liked the Accused but since the affair or since 2003 she had decided to get him into trouble.
[75]
 
She also denied that she had told the Accused’s father then that she had had a good time with the Accused on two occasions and as she no longer required him, she would make sure he would be put behind bars.
[76]
110      Although M had said during the preliminary inquiry that the Accused had fooled and tricked her into having sex with him, she said during the trial that what she had meant was that he had persuaded her to do so.
[77]
 
She said she was not angry with him because that was in the past and the most important thing was that she would not repeat the affair again. In her mind, she too was at fault for it.
[78]
111      M said that notwithstanding the affair, she had allowed V to go with the Accused to the Tampines flat. She still trusted the Accused as a relative as he was the husband of her niece. Moreover, the Accused himself had a daughter then, 
ie
 in 1998 and 1999, and he had wanted to “borrow” V to play with his daughter. She understood that W was not working and thought she would be at home.
[79]
 
She had believed that W was not working in 1998 and 1999.
[80]
Evidence of Dr Lisa Wong
112      Dr Lisa Wong was an associate consultant with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Singapore General Hospital. She had examined V on 29 August 2003. The vaginal examination showed old hymenal tears at 2, 4, 8 and 11 o’clock. This suggested penile penetration.
[81]
113      Initially, V had told her that the Accused’s penis was inserted into her mouth but she was not sure what had been inserted into her vagina.
[82]
 
However, Dr Wong said subsequently that V was unsure as to what was inserted into her mouth and vagina.
[83]
114      Dr Wong agreed that hymenal tears can occur for various reasons other than penile penetration. However, she thought it was unlikely that an injury could cause multiple tears and unlikely that a fall could cause multiple tears.
[84]
 
While Dr Wong accepted that several falls could possibly cause tears to different parts of the hymen, Dr Wong noted that often no hymenal tear would occur just because of a fall.
[85]
Evidence of Dr Parvathy Pathy
115      Dr Parvathy Pathy was a consultant psychiatrist with the Child Guidance Clinic. That clinic was previously at the Institute of Health but the institute’s name had been changed to Health Promotion Board.
116      Dr Pathy had interviewed V and M on 13 October and 3 November 2003. On average, she saw one to three child victims of sexual abuse in a month although at times, she would not see any in a month. She said that there was a range in the length of time that a child victim might take to disclose sexual abuse, ranging from a day to years. There was a variety of reasons for delay. The abuser might have threatened the child not to tell anyone. The child might not realise the meaning of the incident especially when the child was young. Some would feel ashamed or embarrassed. Some might think that nobody would believe them.
[86]
117      Dr Pathy agreed that while V could have told her mother about having to remove her clothes to take a shower, being blindfolded and tied to a bed in the same year when the incident occurred, it was Dr Pathy’s experience that most sexually abused children do not do so.
[87]
 
Indeed, Dr Pathy was not surprised that V did not tell her mother about the incident shortly thereafter.
[88]
 
It was also her view that usually children do not fabricate such lies or have fantasies of a sexual nature.
[89]
118      V did not tell Dr Pathy that she was threatened by the Accused.
[90]
 
V also told Dr Pathy that she liked boys and had held the hands of two boys. There was one other boy she liked but V had only talked to this boy and did not hold his hands. It was not a steady relationship. There was no sexual act with any of these boys.
[91]
119      Dr Pathy was of the view that when V told her that she had sucked the private part of the Accused, this was what V believed and V was not sure about the object she had sucked.
[92]
Evidence of police officers in respect of the four statements
120      It is not necessary for me to repeat the evidence of the police officers which they reiterated during the trial as to how the Accused was brought from the Woodlands flat to PCC and how his four statements came about.
121      However, I should mention that during the trial, the IO accepted that a total of ten cautioned statements had been recorded from the Accused between 5 and 10 September 2003, 
ie
 before the Accused had asked for forgiveness from his wife on 11 September 2003. The IO also said he was not sure for which offence the Accused had sought forgiveness.
[93]
Evidence on first information report
122      Staff Sergeant Eric Neo Chin Hock had recorded the report of M on 25 August 2003. He had spoken to V as well. Aside from a rape allegation, V did tell him that she was made to suck an object which was placed in her mouth. The object was hard and something came out of it.
[94]
Evidence for the Defence
Evidence of the Accused
123      The Accused’s education level is Primary Four from the English stream. He had been residing in the Tampines flat from 1996 to November 2001. On 1 December 2001, he moved to the Woodlands flat.
124      He said that in June or July 1997, he and his wife had brought V for an outing but he had never brought her to the Tampines flat.
[95]
125      Between 1997 and 1999, he was working for the same company at Kian Teck Way from Mondays to Fridays, from 8.30am to 5.30pm. Initially he said he was not required to work for this company on Saturdays.
[96]
 
He had a part-time job then for which he worked on Saturdays and Sundays, from 8.30am till 6.00pm or 7.00pm,
[97]
 
except for those occasions when he had to cover a colleague on a Saturday in his permanent job.
[98]
 
In cross-examination, he said that the name of the company which he had worked for part-time in 1998 and 1999 sounded like “Sian Chuan Motors Trading”. He said this company had been located at Aljunied Road. The building it was located in no longer existed and had been replaced by houses. In cross-examination, he said the company’s business was in the sale of second-hand motor parts but in re-examination, he said he was a second-hand car salesman for it.
[99]
 
He referred to the boss of that company as “boss” and it was his father who had introduced him to the job.
[100]
 
That company did not make any CPF contribution for him and paid him in cash. He agreed that he had not informed the police about his part-time job but said that they did not ask him what he was doing on weekends.
[101]
 
He added that occasionally on Saturdays, besides covering a colleague, he would go to his mother-in-law’s stall in the afternoon to assist.
[102]
126      The Accused’s first child was born on 15 December 1997. His wife was working in 1998 but stopped working after a few months either in June, July or August 1998.
[103]
 
She was not working in 1999.
127      He had known M for 20 years prior to October 2004. He had come to know her when he was her colleague. It was M who had introduced W to him. He confirmed that M and he had had an affair in 1997. He said that after that incident, she warned him not to reveal the relationship.
[104]
 
In examination-in-chief, he said that he did not know whether she was angry with him after the affair but in re-examination, he said that maybe M hated him after that.
[105]
128      The Accused said that one Mr Ismail from the mosque V attended had informed him that in 1998, the religious classes were only on Saturdays and in 1999, V was attending such classes on Mondays and Wednesdays in the afternoon.
[106]
129      He said he was told by his father that on 4 September 2003, when M had spoken to his father at the lobby of PCC, M had said that she was instrumental in putting him behind bars and she was very satisfied. His gut feeling was that she had framed him because she had wanted to borrow $5,000 from him but he was unable to help her.
[107]
 
She had asked him for the loan before V’s birthday party in May 2003.
[108]
130      He also claimed that his father had told him that on that occasion on 4 September 2003, M had lifted up her skirt which revealed a pair of trousers and she had scratched her private part.
131      The Accused said that he had given the four statements because of threats made to him. These were the same threats he had alleged for which a 
voir dire
 was conducted and I need not repeat them. However, the Accused added during the trial that as regards his cautioned statement, it was the interpreter Ms Masdiana who had taught him what to say in his plea for leniency, except that the words regarding the completion of his reservist duty were his own. The Accused accepted that his allegation about what the interpreter had suggested to him was itself not raised with the interpreter when she was on the stand. However, he said that this was because he had only told his counsel that the fellatio charge was untrue.
[109]
132      The Accused identified various parts of the first two statements given on 5 September 2003 as having been fabricated by him because of the threats he had received. Those were the parts where he had admitted to bringing V to the Tampines flat and to getting her to commit fellatio. He had fabricated them because he was hoping to see his father and his wife.
[110]
133      The Accused said that two or three days after 5 September 2003 he had gathered his courage and told the IO that he denied doing anything to V. However, he was not able to identify any denial recorded in a subsequent statement of his on 8 September 2003. He then said that his denial was on another day after the 8 September 2003 statement was recorded.
[111]
134      As for the Accused’s fourth statement where he apologised to his wife for doing something wrong to V, the Accused reiterated his evidence in the trial within a trial which I need not repeat.
Evidence of the Accused’s father
135      Mohamed bin Ali is the father of the Accused.
136      He said that on 4 September 2003, M had claimed that it was she who had caused the Accused to be put into a lock-up. She informed him that she had let the Accused have sex with her twice and she lifted up her baju kurung, revealing a pair of pants underneath and patted her private part to indicate her urge for sex. She also used her fingers to scratch her private part. Since the urge was gone, she decided to report the matter to the police and was satisfied that she had caused the Accused to be put into the lock-up. M was screaming like a vampire that she was very satisfied and was screaming for some time.
[112]
 
Yet Mr Mohamed also said that at that time he did not believe that M had framed the Accused.
[113]
 
On that occasion on 4 September 2003, the Accused’s mother and W were also present. W was not far away from M and Mr Mohamed. Mr Mohamed noticed that M had nudged W’s head with her finger and thereafter M left without speaking to W.
[114]
137      Mr Mohamed said that the Accused was doing a part-time job on Saturdays and Sundays in 1998 and 1999. This job was at a place at No 10 Aljunied Road where houses have since been built. The Accused was selling second-hand cars.
[115]
 
Mr Mohamed said that he himself had worked at this place from January 1996 to the middle of 1997. He did not know the name of the shop or the name of the owner. He would refer to the owner as “towkay”. He said the Accused’s working hours for this part-time job was from 12.00 noon to 7.00pm and the Accused had never missed working there every weekend in 1998 and 1999. He knew this because sometimes he would go to assist in the shop when the Accused called him for his assistance, even though he (Mr Mohamed) had stopped working there since mid-1997. When he helped out, he would work until 12.00 noon on Saturdays and Sundays.
The evidence of the Accused’s wife
138      W’s evidence was that after giving birth to their first child on 15 December 1997, she was on maternity leave for two months. She went back to work but stopped working in or around September 1998. Before she stopped working, she was working on Saturdays. Her mother-in-law who was taking care of the first child had been diagnosed with kidney failure. She remembered that she and her husband had brought V out once after her first child was born.
[116]
139      She said that in 1998 and 1999, the Accused had a part-time job as a car dealer and worked in that job on Saturdays and Sundays from 8.00am to 6.00pm, unless he had to go back to his permanent work place.
[117]
 
However, she was not sure or could not recall whether he could have been doing something else on Saturdays if he was not at his permanent or part-time job.
[118]
140      She said that she was not sure whether M had told Mr Mohamed on 4 September 2003 that M was instrumental or was satisfied in having the Accused put behind bars. She was not sure if M had screamed that she was satisfied but then said M might have said in a loud voice that she was angry.
[119]
 
She said M did lift her baju kurung and pat her private part.
The court’s findings
141      It was obvious to me that V could not remember the years in which the alleged offences were committed. The years 1998 and 1999 were determined by M after a process of deduction starting with V’s reference to the time when she was brought from her first residence in Tampines by the Accused to the Tampines flat to play with his daughter. Using those occasions as a reference point, it was M who deduced that the years were 1998 and 1999. These were the years when V was in Primary One and Primary Two. These two years were within two important perimeters. First, the Accused’s daughter was born on 15 December 1997. Second, M and her family had moved from their first flat in Tampines after she had contracted to sell the same in December 1999.
142      However, M was less certain as to which day of the week V had been brought to play with the Accused’s daughter , although she thought it was on Saturdays as V was attending school daily on weekdays and also religious classes on some weekdays.
143      The next question was whether the Accused did have the opportunity to bring V to the Tampines flat between 1998 and 1999 and to be alone with her.
144      The Accused sought to show that he had no such opportunity because (a) W had stopped working since 1998 and (b) in 1998 and 1999, the Accused had a permanent job where he was working from Mondays to Fridays and he had a part-time job where he worked every weekend.
145      W’s evidence was that she was on maternity leave for two months after the birth of her daughter. Thereafter she went back to work until about September 1998 when she stopped work permanently. Therefore, the fact that she had stopped work could not give the Accused the complete alibi that he wanted.
146      As for the allegation about the part-time job, I did not accept the evidence for the Accused thereon. There were three different versions as to his working hours for the part-time job. He said it was between 8.30am to 6.00pm or 7.00pm. Noraini said it was between 8.00am to 6.00pm. Mr Mohamed said it was between 12.00 noon to 7.00pm.
147      Moreover, I noted that during examination-in-chief, the Accused avoided giving any further details about this part-time job. I also noted that during cross-examination, the Accused hesitated before he came up with the supposed name of the company for which he was working part-time. He also hesitated before he said that he simply referred to the owner as “boss”. In my view, each hesitation was not due to a sudden lapse of memory because, if his allegation were true, he must have considered the information in his mind for some time before he took the stand as he knew that the part-time job was part of his alibi. I was of the view that each hesitation indicated that he had not yet settled in his mind the fabricated evidence he was going to give on these details. In cross-examination, he said that the business was dealing with second-hand motor parts. In re-examination, he said he was dealing in second-hand motor cars. Also, there was no evidence of any attempt made by him to locate this company which was supposedly no longer at its previous place of business or his previous colleagues.
148      The evidence of Mr Mohamed on this issue was such that Mr Mohamed was unable to give any more specifics about this part-time job beyond saying that it was at 10 Aljunied Road. Although he had himself allegedly stopped working there since mid-1997, he was certain that the Accused was working there every weekend. I did not believe that he had been working there before or that he did subsequently go back on Saturdays to help when the Accused asked him to do so.
149      As for W’s evidence on this issue, she did not give any more specifics beyond the Accused’s alleged working hours which were different from the evidence of the Accused and Mr Mohamed as I have mentioned.
150      It was telling that even W was unable to say with certainty that the Accused was doing nothing else on Saturdays except either working at his permanent job, when he was asked to cover a colleague, or at his part-time job.
151      It was clear to me that the part-time job was a fabrication to try and give the Accused a complete alibi.
152      The Accused then came up with a third attempt to give himself some sort of alibi which was a reverse alibi, 
ie
 that V was somewhere else on Saturdays in 1998. As I have mentioned, the Accused said that Mr Ismail from the mosque V attended had informed him that in 1998, the religious classes were only on Saturday mornings. I did not believe this evidence because the Accused had sufficient opportunity to subpoena this Mr Ismail to give evidence in court but he did not, even though he said this information was crucial for him.
[120]
 
Secondly, he claimed to have obtained this information only after the second tranche of the trial
[121]
 
but I noted that on 2 August 2004, during the second tranche of the trial, his defence counsel had already suggested to V that she was attending religious classes on Saturday mornings in 1998.
[122]
153      Next, the Accused suggested that he was being framed by M with whom he had had an affair in about 1997. If this were true, it would mean that M had persuaded V to lie in order to frame the Accused. Yet, this important link was never suggested to M or to V in cross-examination. Notwithstanding this important omission, I did consider whether the Accused was being framed.
154      Evidence was given by Mr Mohamed that M had told him on 4 September 2003 at the lobby of PCC that she was instrumental in causing the Accused to be put in a lock-up because she no longer wanted sex from the Accused and she was screaming like a vampire saying that she was very satisfied. The sole purpose of such evidence was to suggest that she had framed the Accused. Yet when Mr Mohamed was asked whether he believed that M had framed the Accused, he said he did not.
[123]
 
W also did not suggest that M had framed the Accused.
155      Even the allegation that M had lifted up her skirt or baju kurung to scratch her private part was fabricated. When it was suggested to M that she had lifted up her skirt, she promptly retorted that she never wears skirts. On that day, she was wearing jeans.
[124]
 
It was after this riposte that the evidence for the Defence was that she was wearing pants underneath her baju kurung. Yet it was not suggested to M that she was wearing pants underneath her baju kurung. I mention this incident because it demonstrated the propensity of the Defence to come up with fabricated evidence.
156      As for the Accused’s allegation that M had warned him not to reveal the affair, I believed M that she did not give such a warning and that she had accepted that she too was partly to blame for it. In any event, there was no evidence that the Accused had revealed the affair until after M had made a police report about sexual abuse against V. Accordingly, the Accused’s allegation about M’s warning was a red herring.
157      As for the Accused’s belated allegation that M had wanted to borrow $5,000 from him, this allegation was not even raised with M during cross-examination. It was clear to me that the Accused had fabricated this allegation as well.
158      The evidence also demonstrated that while M and the Accused may have maintained some distance between them after the affair, there was no rancour. It appeared that no one else suspected anything had occurred between the two and the Accused was invited, along with his family, to attend V’s birthday party in May 2003.
159      While it may well have been imprudent for M to have allowed V to go with the Accused to the Tampines flat bearing in mind the affair she had had with the Accused while the Accused was married to W, the question was whether she did in fact allow this. It was clear to me that M did not suspect that the Accused might be a threat to V. In her simple mind, V was just going over to play with the Accused’s daughter and she did allow this.
160      On this point, I also accepted V’s evidence that she did go over on occasions to the Tampines flat with the Accused to play with his daughter.
161      In the circumstances, I was of the view that M had not framed the Accused. I was also of the view that the Accused did take V to the Tampines flat in 1998 and 1999. However, it did not necessarily follow that V was telling the truth about the sexual abuse. There was a delay of about five to six years before V had mentioned the abuse first to H on 8 August 2003.
162      The Defence relied on a statement by Yong CJ in 
DT v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 587
; 
[2001] SGHC 193
 at [62] that “it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends”.
163      I noted that that statement was actually first made in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 (“
Tang Kin Seng
”) when Yong CJ said at [79]:
The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim’s testimony more credible. The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim’s evidence 
less
 credible. The reason is simply common human experience. It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim’s actions depart from it. It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proferred. All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.
164      In that case, the victim was a maid of 27 years of age. There was no issue about any delay in her reporting of the offence there. The passage which the Defence had relied on was said in the context of whether a previous complaint could constitute corroboration.
165      The statement was reiterated by Yong CJ in 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 (“
Tan Pin Seng
”). The victim in that case was 22 years of age. There was a delay of five days in making a police report. The accused person had contended that an adverse inference should be drawn against the victim for failing to make a prompt police report and had relied on the passage from 
Tang Kin Seng
 which I have cited above. Yong CJ said at [29]:
I found this contention to be totally misconceived. The test in each case is the yardstick of common human experience. While it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends, the same cannot be said of a failure to make a prompt police report. In my experience, there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report. This stems from a variety of reasons. …
166      In 
DT v PP
 ([162] 
supra
), there were two charges of outrage of modesty. The first incident occurred when the victim was aged ten. The second incident occurred about two years later. After each incident, the victim related what had happened to her grandmother who instructed her not to reveal the incidents to anyone, including her mother. The complainant, however, confided in her close friend after the second incident. No police reports were made immediately after each incident and the allegations were raised some two years after the second incident during a family gathering, after which police reports were made. In that case, Yong CJ said that there was no general rule which requires victims of sexual abuse, or those cognisant of the same, to report them immediately, more so to the police. After referring to what he had said in 
Tan Pin Seng
 and 
Tang Kin Seng
, Yong CJ accepted the explanation of the grandmother for not reporting the incidents to the police promptly.
167      In the case before me, it was not a question of delay in reporting the matter to the police. V had not mentioned the alleged abuse at all for five or six years until she first disclosed the same to H.
168      Although no threat was made against and no bribe was offered to V, an important consideration was the fact that V was only about seven to eight years of age at the time of the alleged abuse.
169      Having considered the evidence, I was not surprised at the delay in disclosure for five or six years. I was of the view that the reason for the delay was because V had not realised the full meaning and gravity of the acts of abuse and the acts of blindfolding her and tying her. The significance of all these acts had eluded her just as the significance of the absence of the Accused’s daughter had eluded her. It was not so much because she feared she might not be believed. In my view, V was trying to rationalise in her own mind the reasons for her delay in disclosing the abuse but that was different from saying that she had fabricated the abuse.
170      V had begun to realise the significance of the abuse after the sex education in 2002 when she was in Primary Five. There was a delay of about one year between the time of the sex education and the time she first disclosed the abuse to H on 8 August 2003. I was of the view that this delay was because she was grappling with the significance of what had happened and because she feared she would not be believed. Both H and Myg had testified that V had said she was afraid to tell her parents and had looked sad while narrating the incident. I did not find it incredulous that V should choose to make the disclosure to her friends rather than to M. As the incident involved an adult, she was probably more fearful about disclosing it to another adult first, even though that would be her own mother. Hence she discussed the matter first with her friends.
171      I would add that I do not find it surprising that children think that they may not be believed. In my view, it is adults’ instinctive response when told about something serious by children that causes children to feel this way. For instance, M said that when she was told about the abuse, she had cautioned V about telling lies. Even the Prosecution reminded V, and H and Myg as well, that they had to tell the truth in court. I do not blame the Prosecution for its caution but we should not be unduly sceptical when a child says that she did not disclose a serious matter earlier because of her fear of disbelief. A child may even fear being scolded for making such serious allegations against an adult.
172      I come now to the evidence of V that there was one incident when she was in a car with M and the Accused. She had wanted to tell M that she did not want to go with the Accused but had failed to do so. To me, this reflected her confusion. As for the point that she did not reveal anything to her parents after she returned home, this was probably because she had lost whatever little focus she had had on the abuse once she was no longer with the Accused.
173      Ultimately, I found V to be generally candid with her evidence. I accepted V’s evidence about how she was wrapped in a towel, and blindfolded and her hands were tied to the bed in the master bedroom of the Tampines flat while she was alone with the Accused.
174      As regards the first charge, I was also of the view that the Accused did insert an object into V’s mouth to suck. The question was whether it was his penis in order to constitute the offence of carnal intercourse. I noted that the Accused had ensured that V did not see the object she sucked. I was of the view that it was not an innocuous object. I was not surprised that V was not certain that she had sucked his penis given the fact that she was blindfolded and was of a tender age then. However, V did mention to Staff Sergeant Eric Neo when the report was first made that the object was hard and something had come out of it. At trial, V also said that the object was long and watery and she did not like the taste of it. Even if I were to discount V’s evidence at trial as having been the result of suggestions or questions to her before the trial commenced, there was corroboration from some of the Accused’s statements that the object she was made to suck was his penis.
175      As regards the fourth statement in which the Accused had sought forgiveness from his wife for what he had done to V, this appeared at first blush to be damning evidence against the Accused. Certainly it was strong evidence that he had committed a serious wrong against V but what was this serious wrong? As I have mentioned, the evidence revealed that prior to 11 August 2003 when the Accused had sought forgiveness, he had given ten cautioned statements. As a result, even the IO was constrained to say that he did not know for which offence the Accused was seeking forgiveness.
[125]
 
In the circumstances, although I found that the fourth statement had been given voluntarily and was admissible in evidence, I gave no weight to it.
176      As for the first three statements, which included the cautioned statement, I was mindful of the fact that the Accused had undergone two long sessions of interrogation on 4 September 2003. Even though I concluded that the Accused had fabricated the allegations of threats, violence and inducement, I was of the view that he must have been tired and anxious. He mentioned a number of times that he had not been allowed to see his father and his wife who was about to deliver their third child. I considered whether he had decided to capitulate out of sheer exhaustion and in the hope of being allowed to see his father and wife soon thereafter. However, I noted that the Accused was not one who was particularly submissive. When he was first asked to accompany the police officers in the morning of 4 September 2003, his instinctive response was not to comply but to say that he would prefer to wait for his father. Secondly, it was his own evidence that at the end of the two sessions, he was still denying that he had done anything wrong. Thirdly, he did not suggest that he decided to capitulate out of exhaustion and anxiety at not being able to see his father and wife. Rather, his position was that he had given the three statements in response to threats, violence and inducement which I had concluded had not occurred. Fourthly, the Accused had admitted only to causing V to perform fellatio on him. If he was going to capitulate because of exhaustion and anxiety, he would not have restricted his admission to this only.
177      It seemed to me that the Accused had taken a calculated decision to admit to only one offence which he had viewed as the least serious, hoping that he would get a lenient sentence and that the authorities would not pursue any other offence. He had also decided to minimise his statement on what he had actually done in the course of the abuse. That is why he did not mention that he had tied V’s hands and blindfolded her. I found that the Accused would not have admitted to causing V to perform fellatio on him, if it had not occurred.
178      I did not accept that the substance of the Accused’s plea of leniency in his cautioned statement was suggested to him by the interpreter. That point was not raised with the interpreter when she was under cross-examination. I did not accept the Accused’s explanation that the reason for this omission was because he had not told his counsel about it. In my view, the plea for leniency was a genuine one from him. He was even hoping to be able to serve his reservist duty from 16 September 2003 to 30 September 2003 and this, he admitted, had not been suggested to him by the interpreter.
179      Much was made by the Defence of the fact that in the Accused’s first statement, he had said that he had brought V (to the Tampines flat) in the middle of 1997, but yet he had admitted to a charge which stated that the offence of fellatio was committed between 1998 and 1999. I should say first that it was not the duty of the IO to check why the Accused was admitting to a charge with different dates or to try and correct the Accused’s statement. The statement was that of the Accused and the charge was based on what the IO had learnt from V and M.
180      The fact that the Accused was admitting to a charge with different dates from that which the Accused had mentioned in his statement did not mean that the admission was devoid of any weight. It seemed to me that it did not matter to the Accused then whether he was admitting to an offence committed in 1997 or one committed between 1998 and 1999 since he was already claiming, in his second statement, that he had brought V to the Tampines flat only once in any event.
181      In the circumstances, I had no reasonable doubt that the Accused had caused V to perform fellatio on him.
182      In the context of the second charge, there was medical evidence of penetration of V’s vagina. In my view, the hymenal tears were not the result of falls or some sporting activity but of sexual abuse by the Accused.
183      Accordingly, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the first charge and on the second charge. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on each of these charges. Although the Accused had no antecedents and no other charges were being taken into consideration, V had been entrusted to the Accused. Also, the act of outraging V’s modesty was not one of touching her vagina but inserting an object into it which caused her pain. In the circumstances, I sentenced him to five and a half years’ imprisonment on the first charge under s 377 Penal Code and six years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane on the second charge under s 354A(2)(b) Penal Code. The sentences were to run concurrently and from the date of sentencing as the Accused had been out on bail.
Accused convicted.

MPH Rubin J:
1
         
 On 24 September 2004, I convicted Sundarti Supriyanto, the accused in this case, on a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”) (
[2004] SGHC 212
). After hearing submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I sentenced the accused to life imprisonment. I now give my reasons.
2
         
 After the court had found the accused guilty and convicted her, the Prosecution applied for five charges (one amended since), which were stood down at the beginning of the trial, to be taken into consideration in sentencing the accused, if she consented as much. The charges averred that the accused committed the offences of:
(a)
       
 culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing Crystal’s death, punishable under s 304(a) PC;
(b)
       
 mischief by fire with the intent to cause the destruction of a building which is used as a place for the custody of property by pouring petrol and setting the said premises on fire, punishable under s 436 PC;
(c)
       
 theft of several items in the possession of the deceased, punishable under s 380 PC;
(d)
       
 theft of several items in the possession of one Steven Yeo Hwee Lee, punishable under s 380 PC; and
(e)
       
 attempted theft of money in the possession of the Development Bank of Singapore Limited by attempting to make unauthorised withdrawals from a Post Office Saving Bank Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) with a stolen ATM card belonging to one Tay Mui Cheng, punishable under s 379 PC.
I informed the accused that her agreement to take the charges into consideration would have a bearing on her sentence. The charges were then read to the accused in the Indonesian language. She admitted to them and consented to take them into consideration in sentencing. The Prosecution informed me that the accused did not have any antecedents. I then proceeded to hear the accused’s mitigation plea.
Mitigation
3
         
 Counsel for the accused submitted that the accused continued to work in Singapore as a domestic maid because, after the demise of her father, she had to take on the responsibility of being the breadwinner of her family. It was submitted that she carried out her work to the best of her abilities, but her best was not good enough for the deceased. This was attributed to the vast differences in culture and lifestyle in her village as compared to Singapore, thereby resulting in her having difficulties in carrying out instructions promptly and efficiently. Counsel for the accused also informed the court that the accused had a message written in Bahasa Indonesia to convey to the family of the deceased, requesting that it be read out in court. I allowed the request, and the message was read in English by her counsel as follows:
I wish to express my deepest apology to the family of [the deceased’s husband] for the events which took place in that fateful night, which had brought tragedy and grief to him and his family …
4
         
 Counsel implored the court for a lighter sentence, urging the court to exercise compassion. In this regard, counsel submitted that the accused was not a cold-blooded killer, and due regard should be given to the fact that the accused had saved the baby from the fire. Following this, I called on the Prosecution to submit on the sentence.
The Prosecution’s submission on sentence
5
         
 The Prosecution submitted that the prescribed punishment under s 304(a) PC is imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and the offender shall also be liable to be fined or caned. In respect of case precedents, the Prosecution submitted that there is no fixed benchmark sentence for cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) PC. In this respect, the Prosecution relied on the case of 
PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
, where it was observed at [33]:
We were of the view that it is not desirable, unlike simple rape, to set a benchmark for culpable homicide. The range of circumstances in which such offences are committed is extremely varied …
6
         
 The Prosecution further submitted that in 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 
[1998] 2 SLR 345
, the appellant had succeeded in his defence of grave and sudden provocation and was convicted on a charge under s 304(a) PC. At trial, he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment, but on appeal, the sentence was enhanced to life imprisonment. The Prosecution also relied on a slew of cases where the courts have meted out sentences of life imprisonment in cases of culpable homicide under s 304(a) PC, including 
PP v Ng Kwok Soon
 
[2002] 3 SLR 199
, 
PP v Muhamad Hasik bin Sahar
 
[2002] 3 SLR 149
 and 
PP v Saminathan s/o Subramaniam
 
[2002] SGHC 259
. The Prosecution then urged the court to consider the nature of the accused’s attack on the deceased, and submitted that the sentence of life imprisonment was warranted in this case.
The decision on sentence
7
         
 I took into consideration the accused’s mitigation plea and the address by the Prosecution in arriving at my decision on the sentence to be imposed on the accused. Before I handed down the sentence, I informed the accused that she had narrowly managed to escape the executioner’s noose by a very slender margin – the margin that separates the offence of murder from culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It was indeed a close call and the result might well have been much worse for the accused in some other jurisdictions.
8
         
 Under s 304(a) PC, the prescribed sentence for the offence for which the accused was convicted is either life imprisonment or a prison term which may extend to ten years. There is no middle band. In my view, the nature of the offence for which the accused was convicted – let alone the charges taken into consideration – called for a higher tariff, and certainly a sentence of ten years would be manifestly inadequate. In this respect, I took into account the nature of the injuries inflicted on the deceased by the accused and the manner in which she had tried to mask the offence with a view to escaping the process of law and justice. I considered all that was said on behalf of the accused, including one significant aspect that she had somehow ensured the safety of the deceased’s infant son from the raging fire, which was of course started by the accused.
9
         
 However, having regard to the fact that there is no middle range of sentence between ten years and life imprisonment, I sentenced the accused to a term of life imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest, 
ie
 10 June 2002. I also informed the accused that she may, at the appropriate time, apply to the President through her counsel for any commutation of the sentence. Pursuant to s 178(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), an entry was made on the record that the accused shall not, unless the conviction which had been recorded against her on 24 September 2004 is set aside, be liable to be charged or tried in respect of the offences so taken into consideration.
10
       
 It was further ordered that all non-documentary exhibits be released to the police for disposal after completion of the judicial process.",2004-10-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

1.         The Accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted of 3 charges, consisting of criminal misappropriation, attempted cheating and abetment by conspiracy to commit cheating.  He was sentenced to imprisonment of 3 months, 2 months and 7 months respectively.  Two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total of 9 months’ imprisonment.  The Prosecution has appealed against the sentences imposed.

2.         The criminal misappropriation charge stated that the Accused had on 13 June 2004, between 2 pm and 5 pm at People’s Park Complex, dishonestly misappropriated a credit card belonging to one Jessy Lee.    As for the attempted cheating charge, the Accused was charged that he had attempted to dishonestly induce one Cheah Hong Ching to accept the use of a credit card belonging to Jessy Lee for the payment of a watch worth $160 on 13 June 2004 at Messrs Kim Land Trading, People’s Park Complex.   Finally, as regards the abetment by conspiracy of cheating charge, the Accused was charged that in June 2004, he engaged with one Teo Yee Lin Judy in a conspiracy to cheat, and in order to cheat, on 13 June 2004, Teo Yee Lin Judy presented the credit card belonging to Jessy Lee to one Chu Thiam Soon at People’s Park Complex for the payment of a mobile phone worth $1,004.50.
3.         One other charge of abetment by conspiracy of cheating and one of such abetment of attempted cheating were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.
The Facts
4.         The Statement of Facts as tendered by the Prosecution, reads in material parts:
5.         … [O]n 13 June 2004 between 2 pm and 5 pm, the accused and the accomplice [Teo Yee Lin Judy] were assigned to an OSIM road show at 1 Park Road, People’s Park Complex, level 1, Singapore.  While there, he spotted the complainant’s Citibank credit card inside the drawer at the cashier counter at No. 1 Park Road, People’s Park Complex, Level 1.   
6.         Noticing that no one was around, the accused took the said credit card and kept it, with the intention of using it to make fraudulent purchases.  He left the said premises thereafter.  Accused had no intention to return the said credit card to its owner.
7.         [O]n 13 June 2004, after keeping the … credit card, the accused went to M/s Kimland Trading, located at 1 Park Road, #01-90, People’s Park Complex, Singapore. 
8.         Whilst inside the said premises, the accused chose an ‘American Time’ watch valued at $160 and presented the complainant’s Cibitank credit card bearing no. 4404 3720 0024 9919  in the name of Jessy Lee to one Cheah Hong Ching, the salesperson of the said establishment, for payment.
9.         The said Cheah Hong Ching swiped the credit card through the electronic funds transfer (point of sale) system for approval and the transaction was approved.  A charge slip was printed for the transaction and the accused duly signed on the charge slip.
10.        Thereafter, the said Cheah Hong Ching compared the signature on the charge slip and the one on the back of the complainant’s credit card.  He found them to be different and therefore, he proceeded to void the transaction and he informed the accused accordingly.  Thereafter, the accused left the said premises.
11.        By presenting the complainant’s Citibank credit card to the said Cheah Hong Ching, the accused had attempted to deceive him into believing that he was the rightful holder of the said credit card when the accused knew he was not and thereby dishonestly attempt to induce the said Cheah Hong Ching to deliver the aforesaid item to him. 
12.        … [A]fter the accused’s attempt to use the complainant’s credit card failed, he contacted the accomplice and informed her about it.  The two of them eventually agreed to use the said credit card to make fraudulent purchases.
13.        Further investigations revealed that on 13 June 2004, at about 7.56 pm, the accused and the accomplice were at Speed One Pte Ltd, located at 1 Park Road #02-K73, People’s Park Complex, Singapore. 
14.        Pursuant to their conspiracy to cheat, whilst inside the said premises, the accused chose a Nokia 7610 mobile phone valued at $1,004.50 and the accomplice presented the complainant’s credit card …. to one Chu Thiam Soon Stanley, the salesperson of the said establishment, for payment.
15.        The said Chu Thiam Soon Stanley swiped the said credit card through the electronic funds transfer (point of sales) system for approval and the transaction was approved.  A charge slip was printed for the transaction and the accomplice duly signed on the charge slip. In so doing, the accomplice had deceived the said Chu Thian Soon Stanley into believing that she was the rightful holder of the said credit card when the accused knew she was not, and thereby dishonestly induced the said Chu Thiam Soon Stanley to deliver the aforesaid item to her, which offence was committed in consequences [sic] of the accused’s abetment.  Thereafter, the accused and the accomplice left the said premises. Accused admitted abetting the accomplice, Tey Yee Lin, to present the Citibank credit card .. to the said sales person for payment of the Nokia handphone and deceiving into believing that she was the rightful holder of the credit card, when he knew she was not.
Antecedents
5.         The Accused was previously placed on 24 months’ probation in 2000 for robbery with common intention. 
The accomplice
6.         The accomplice, Teo Yee Lin, Judy was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment in July.  The Court was informed that she faced two charges involving cheating, with 12 months’ imprisonment on each charge, the sentences running concurrently.  A third charge was taken into consideration.  These charges were similar to the abetment of cheating charges against the Accused.  Her antecedents as disclosed to this Court consisted of 18 months’ probation ordered for theft in May 2003, and another 18 months’ probation ordered for Films Act offences in August 2003.    The latter probation was ordered to run concurrently with the former.
Mitigation
7.         In mitigation, aside from the personal circumstances of the Accused, Counsel relied on an early plea of guilt, the absence of any previous conviction, the cooperation by the accused with the police, and the remorse of the accused, as shown by the restitution made by him of a sum of $1,150.    Counsel also emphasised that the offences were not syndicated offences, and these were one time transactions. 
8.         In reply, Prosecution noted that this was not a one transaction situation. 
The sentence passed
9.         A sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment was imposed for the criminal misappropriation, 2 months’ imprisonment for the attempted cheating, and 7 months’ imprisonment for the abetment of cheating by the accomplice.  The sentences for the charges of attempted cheating and abetment of cheating were ordered to run consecutively, with the remaining sentence running concurrently, giving a total of 9 months’ imprisonment.
10.       In sentencing the Accused the Court noted that he was not actually a first offender, having previously been placed on probation for having committed robbery with common intention.  This was a relevant antecedent in considering the sentence to be imposed.
11.       Another significant factor in favour of a heavier sentence was the fact  that there were 2 other charges of abetment of attempted cheating and abetment of cheating  to be taken into consideration.  These charges involved items worth a total of $2,139.  
12.       What was significant to the mind of the Court was the restitution effected by the Accused.  A payment of $1,150 was made to the credit card company; this was slightly more than the value of the items actually obtained by the accused and his accomplice through their criminal acts.    Restitution reflecting remorse and good character is of some mitigating force:  Krishan Chand v PP 
[1995] SGHC 98
.    In Tan Sai Tiang v PP 
[2000] SGHC 4
, the learned Chief Justice said:
I pointed out in Krishan Chand v PP … that the making of restitution is generally a relevant mitigating factor where the appellant’s act of doing so reveals on his part genuine remorse and basic good character.  … The appellant’s act along with her early plea of guilt and the fact that this was the first time she had committed such offences reflected sincere remorse and her basic good character.  That she did so after being caught and charged should have less bearing in light of the more important fact that she subsequently made full restitution of the moneys. 
13.       In the present case, although the Accused was not a first offender, the antecedent involved probation which he apparently completed successfully.   The restitution made by him appears to disclose heartfelt  genuine remorse.  In the view of the Court, the approach adopted in Tan Sai Tiang applied, and the Accused merited an appropriate reduction in sentence.  
14.       These factors were borne in mind when the Court considered the individual charges.
15.       With respect to that for misappropriation, the Court noted that the item concerned was a credit card, the misappropriation of which gave occasion to the other offences.   It is a serious criminal act, and should attract some time in custody.  Nonetheless, the sentence for such misappropriation should not be of the same duration as one for theft, since the latter involves greater culpability in moving the item out of the possession of its owner.    The punishment prescribed for an offence under s 403 is either a fine, or imprisonment up to 2 years, or both.  In the circumstances, the Court was of the view that 3 months’ imprisonment was more than appropriate.
16.       Turning then to the sentence imposed for the charge of attempted cheating, aside from the mitigatory factors noted above, the criminal act here did not take place successfully.   The value of the subject matter of the attempt was $160.  While the use of a credit card to commit cheating is serious, this was outweighed firstly by the charge being one of attempt, which should therefore attract a lighter sentence than an offence carried out successfully, and additionally by the relatively low value of the item in question.  In view of all of this, a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment appeared to be appropriate.
17.       Finally, as regards the charge of abetment of attempted cheating, the Court noted that  the accomplice was given 12 months on each of the two charges proceeded with against her.  In sentencing the Accused, the Court took into account that the property obtained by the cheating, valued at about $1,000, was recovered, and there was in the end no loss suffered.  The restitution made by the Accused was, as noted above, a significant factor in reducing the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed.  In the view of the Court a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment was adequate.
18.       Bearing in mind the conduct of the Accused, the one transaction rule and the totality principle, it was to the Court sufficient to order the sentences for attempted cheating and abetment of cheating to run consecutively, for a total of 9 months’ imprisonment, with the sentence for criminal misappropriation running concurrently.  To the Court, there was nothing on the facts of this case that required a heavier aggregate sentence to be imposed.",2004-11-01 00:00:00,SG District Court

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant, Chan Chan Wah, was charged under s 411 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for dishonestly retaining an assortment of jewellery knowing these items to be stolen property (“the first charge”). He was also charged under s 35(3) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) for being in possession of an assortment of jewellery which he had reason to believe to be stolen or fraudulently obtained (“the second charge”). District Judge Abdul Rahim B A Jalil convicted the appellant of both charges and sentenced him to a total of 12 months’ imprisonment: see 
PP v Chan Chan Wah
 
[2004] SGDC 181
. The appellant appealed against conviction.
The facts
Undisputed facts
2          The appellant owned two jewellery shops, one at Lucky Plaza (“the Lucky Plaza shop”) and one at People’s Park Complex (“the People’s Park Shop”). On 5 April 2002, five Hong Kong nationals – Cheung Kan Lam also known as Lam Chye (“Cheung”), Lam Kong Shan Samuel (“Sam”), Lam Chi Yu (“Lam”), Chan Fook Ming also known as Ah Mong (“Ah Mong”) and Yiu Pun Wa also known as Ah Ti (“Yiu”) – were arrested for housebreaking. On the following day, the appellant was called up by the police and was told to surrender all the items that he had purchased from the five Hong Kong nationals. He surrendered 24 pieces of jewellery to the police. These 24 pieces of jewellery were purchased from Cheung and Sam. Later that day, another 148 pieces of jewellery were recovered from the Lucky Plaza shop. The appellant had also bought these 148 pieces from Cheung and Sam. Cheung and Sam had stolen all the 172 pieces of jewellery that were recovered by the police. Out of the 172 pieces, 132 of them were subsequently identified by their owners as having been stolen from them.
3          Another raid was conducted at the Lucky Plaza shop on 25 April 2002. That raid was triggered by a police report made by one Julia Cudron (“Julia”) when she saw what she believed were jewellery pieces stolen from her on display in the shop. The police seized 24 items of jewellery which Julia identified as belonging to her. It was undisputed that Cheung and Sam had earlier broken into Julia’s residence and had stolen various items including jewellery.
4         
 
A total of 196 pieces of jewellery were recovered. Of these, 156 pieces (made up of the 132 pieces identified by their owners and the 24 pieces identified by Julia in the Lucky Plaza shop on 25 April 2002) were referred to in the first charge. The remaining 40 pieces that were not identified by their owners formed the subject matter of the second charge.
The Prosecution’s case
5         
 
The Prosecution contended that the appellant knew all along that the items of jewellery he purchased from Cheung and Sam came from instances of housebreaking committed by them in Singapore. The appellant had agreed to buy these stolen jewellery at very low prices, and was in effect acting as an accomplice to this group of Hong Kong burglars operating in Singapore by assisting them to turn these stolen properties into cash.
6          To prove that the appellant knew the items to be stolen property, the Prosecution relied mainly on the evidence of Lam. Lam testified that he came to Singapore in 2002 and stayed in a flat with Cheung, Sam and Ah Mong. He met the appellant on five or six occasions. On the second and third occasions, the appellant went to their flat empty-handed but left the flat carrying bags. During the fourth occasion, Lam saw the appellant wearing a Patek Phillipe watch. The appellant pointed at the watch and said that he had brought the watch for repair. The appellant added that the repairer had commented that the watch had been reported stolen and had told him to take it back. On the last occasion when Lam met the appellant at the flat, the appellant told Cheung that he should go to Malaysia to “take a rest”. The appellant further said that “it had already been done for so long and the police would have known about it”.
7         
 
The Prosecution also relied on the police statement of Sam. In particular, the Prosecution placed emphasis on the following answers given by Sam in his statement:
Q97:  Do you know of anybody else other than the persons arrested together with you that sold stolen items to Mr Chan (B6) [the appellant]?
A97:  I have heard from Mr Chan himself and ‘Lam Chye’ that ‘Ah Mong’ and ‘Ah Tee’ had done the same things, 
ie
 sold stolen jewellery to Mr Chan.
Q98:  Can you elaborate more on this?
A98:  On one occasion when I was in Mr Chan’s office in Lucky Plaza, Mr Chan had shown me his wrist which had a Patek Phillipe watch on it. This was sometime in Mar 02. The watch had a black leather strap. Mr Chan told me that the watch was sold to him by ‘Ah Mong’ for S$3,000/-. He had bought it for his own use. At that time Mr Chan had told me that ‘Ah Mong’ had stolen the watch. I think it was on the same occasion that Mr Chan mentioned about Ah Tee’s ‘harvest’ being much bigger than ours. By the word ‘harvest’, I understood it to mean what we were doing, 
ie
 burglary. …
Q99:  Does Mr Chan know that the jewellery sold to him by yourself or Lam Chye are stolen items?
A:  Yes. Lam Chye had mentioned to Mr Chan that some Singaporeans actually had nothing at home but fake items.
8         
 
In respect of the 24 pieces of jewellery that were seized on 25 April 2002, the Prosecution’s case was that these items were likewise stolen by Cheung and Sam and sold to the appellant. Reliance was placed on Julia’s testimony that she could identify the 24 items as belonging to her.
The Defence’s case
9         
 
There were two parts to the Defence’s case. Firstly, the appellant had no knowledge at all that the 172 items of jewellery sold to him by Cheung and Sam were stolen property. Secondly, with regard to the 24 items seized on 25 April 2002, the appellant had not purchased them from Cheung and Sam.
The appellant’s testimony
10       
 
The appellant testified that he first came to know Cheung on one of his business trips to Shenzhen. In August 2001, he went to Shenzhen again with his friend Tji Weng Foang (“Tji”), and Cheung invited them to his restaurant. The appellant saw people gambling illegally at the back of the restaurant. Cheung informed the appellant that many of the gamblers who had lost money would pledge their jewellery to him. Cheung asked the appellant whether he was interested in buying the pledged jewellery, and the appellant told him he would like to look at the items first.
11       
 
On 5 December 2001, Cheung met the appellant at the People’s Park shop. Cheung was with Sam and Yiu. A few days later, Cheung went to the Lucky Plaza shop and sold the appellant the first batch of jewellery, reassuring the appellant that the jewellery pieces were all pledged items that had not been redeemed. The appellant wrote out the prices of the items he bought on a piece of paper, but he did not retain a copy for himself as it was his own business and he was buying those items himself. No receipt was issued to Cheung, nor was there any other documentation that recorded the sale.
12       
 
The appellant bought more jewellery from Cheung and Sam on five other occasions. The total value of the six transactions amounted to about $130,000. All the transactions were done in the daytime and the appellant’s wife and staff were present in the office of the shop. After buying the jewellery on each of the six occasions, the appellant would hand the items over to his wife who would deal with them as she deemed fit. Most of these pieces of jewellery the appellant had purchased from Cheung and Sam were subsequently sold to other third parties, leaving only the 172 items that were recovered by the police on 6 April 2002.
13        The appellant admitted that he had met the five Hong Kong nationals on several other occasions. On the occasions when he visited them at their flat, Cheung gave him dried marine products and no sales of jewellery took place. The appellant said that he did not own a Patek Phillipe watch, nor did he make any of the comments which Lam and Sam alleged that he had made.
14       
 
The appellant also denied that the 24 pieces of jewellery identified by Julia on 25 April 2002 were purchased from Cheung and Sam.
Esther Tan’s testimony
15       
 
Esther Tan, the appellant’s wife, testified in support of the appellant’s evidence in relation to the transactions with Cheung and Sam that took place in the Lucky Plaza shop. She also supported the appellant’s evidence that the 24 pieces of jewellery seized on 25 April 2002 were not sold to the appellant by Cheung and Lam. Instead, the appellant and herself had purchased these items from shops which were in the process of closing down. In particular, she relied on a tax invoice as documentary proof that some of the 24 items were purchased from one of these shops.
16       
 
Esther Tan further testified that one of these 24 items, a yellow bracelet (marked “P16-0”), was actually sold by one Melissa Wong to her. According to her, when the items were seized on 25 April 2002, Melissa Wong was asked to come to the shop to identify P16-0, and Melissa Wong had said that P16-0 was the bracelet that she sold to Esther Tan.
17       
 
At this juncture, it should be noted that the Prosecution called Melissa Wong as a rebuttal witness. She testified that she had sold a bracelet to Esther Tan but that it was a white gold bracelet and not a yellow bracelet. She further said that she picked up P16-0 when she came down to the shop because the design of P16-0 was very similar to that of the bracelet that she sold to Esther Tan, although the colour was different.
Other Defence witnesses
18       
 
In essence, the other Defence witnesses gave evidence to support the testimonies of the appellant and his wife. Tji corroborated the appellant’s evidence as to what transpired at Shenzhen. The appellant’s shop assistants testified that Melissa Wong had indeed identified P16-0 as the bracelet that she had sold to Esther Tan. The Defence also produced a witness who had prior dealings with the appellant to give evidence that there was no paper documentation involved when she bought or sold jewellery to the appellant.
The decision below
19       
 
Based on the evidence before him, the district judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the items he bought from Cheung and Lam were stolen. In reaching this conclusion, the judge took into account mainly the evidence of Lam and Sam.
20       
 
The district judge found Lam to be a frank and candid witness, and saw no reason why Lam would want to make a false statement against the appellant. He therefore took into account the incriminating evidence from Lam that the appellant had told Cheung to go to Malaysia and “take a rest” as “it had been done for so long and the police would have known about it”. In so doing, the learned judge drew the inference that the appellant was fully aware of Cheung’s acts of housebreaking.
21        Further support for the above finding was derived from Sam’s police statement. Sam testified in court, but he turned hostile and claimed to be unable to remember many relevant facts. The district judge therefore granted the Prosecution’s application to impeach his credit and to further substitute his police statement in place of his testimony in court. The judge went on to take into account those parts of Sam’s statement that incriminated the appellant. This included the references made to the conversation between Sam and the appellant, during which the appellant had told Sam that his Patek Phillipe watch was stolen property and sold to him by Chan, and had made reference to “harvest” which Sam understood to mean burglary. The court was further influenced by the fact that the reference to the Patek Phillipe watch in Sam’s statement was consistent with Lam’s testimony.
22       
 
The court also took into consideration other circumstantial evidence. The absence of documentation recording the transactions led to the inference that the transactions with Cheung and Lam were illegitimate. Furthermore, the appellant’s testimony that he had paid a total amount of about $130,000 to Cheung and Lam was riddled with inconsistencies. In addition, the learned judge also noted that the business arrangement alleged by the appellant was illogical and suspicious. The judge pointed out that it would have made no business sense for Cheung and Lam to come all the way from China to sell the pledged items of jewellery to the appellant in Singapore.
23       
 
In relation to the 24 pieces of jewellery seized on 25 April 2002, Julia was able to give consistent accounts in court of the history behind each of the items she had identified and was further able to produce photographs of four of these items. In contrast, the Defence could not satisfactorily explain the appellant’s possession of the 24 items. The tax invoice produced by the Defence made no reference to the items in question. It was also difficult to believe Esther Tan’s claim that the tax invoice constituted evidence of their purchase of the items since there were no identifying marks on these items. It would have been quite impossible for Esther Tan, who dealt with thousands of jewellery in the course of business, to distinguish them as being part of those items stated in the tax invoice. The court accordingly found that the 24 pieces of jewellery belonged to Julia and were stolen from her by Cheung and Sam.
24       
 
In view of the above findings, the district judge held that the appellant was guilty of the first as well as the second charge.
The issues on appeal
25       
 
The appellant set out many arguments in his Petition of Appeal, but basically only three main issues were raised:
(a)        Whether the district judge erred in calling for the defence at the close of the Prosecution’s case.
(b)        Whether the district judge erred in finding that the appellant knew that the jewellery items he purchased from Cheung and Sam were stolen.
(c)        Whether the district judge erred in finding that the 24 items of jewellery seized on 25 April 2002 belonged to Julia Cudron and were stolen from her.
26       
 
The appeal was mainly against the findings of fact made by the district judge. In order to reverse the findings of fact of the court below, the appellant had to show that the findings were clearly erroneous and reached against the weight of the evidence:
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
,
 
Rukiah bte Ismail v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 98
. The burden was a particularly onerous one as the findings stemmed primarily from the trial judge’s assessment of the creditworthiness of the witnesses that appeared before him:
 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
Whether the district judge erred in calling for the defence
27       
 
The appellant contended that the district judge had erred in calling for the defence based on the tenuous evidence adduced by the Prosecution at the close of its case and in subsequently using the Defence’s evidence to convict the appellant. In order to determine if the district judge had indeed made such an error, the elements that make up each of the two offences for which the appellant was charged should first be considered. The first charge was for the offence under s 411 of the Penal Code, which provides as follows:
Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any stolen property, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen property, shall be punished…
28        To establish the offence under s 411, it must be shown that the accused has 
retained
 the stolen property with the 
knowledge
 or 
having reason to believe
 that the property was stolen. I observed that s 411 also makes reference to the retention of the property as being dishonest. Under s 24 of the Penal Code, dishonesty bears the meaning of an “intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person”. In the ordinary case, dishonesty would be indistinguishable from the mental element of “knowledge or having reason to believe that the property was stolen”. In other words, dishonesty does not form an additional 
mens rea
 requirement that needs to be satisfied. This was established in the case of 
Ow Yew Beng v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 536
, where I had stated at [12]:
Ordinarily, the two mental elements of “dishonesty” and “knowing or having reason to believe that the property was stolen” go together. A person who retains property knowing it to be stolen, would naturally possess an intention to cause gain or loss which he knows to be wrongful. Similarly, a person who retains property which he has reason to believe is stolen would normally also have an intention to cause gain or loss which he has reason to believe is wrongful. There may, however, be some situations when these mental elements are not co-extensive. For instance, if a person’s purpose of retention is to hand the property (which he knows or has reason to believe is stolen) to the police for investigations, then he is not dishonest since he has no intention to cause any wrongful loss or gain to anyone at all.
29        The second charge is for the offence under s 35(3) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, which reads as follows:
If it appears to such court that any person so brought before it had possession of such thing and had reasonable cause to believe the same to have been stolen or fraudulently obtained, that person shall be guilty of an offence…
For the offence to be established, it must be shown that the accused had possession of property which he had reason to believe was stolen or fraudulently obtained.
30       
 
In the present case, with regard to the 172 pieces of jewellery that were seized by the police on 6 April 2002, it was not disputed that these pieces were stolen by Cheung and Sam and that they were in the possession of the appellant when they were seized. Therefore, the elements of “retention” under the first charge and “possession” under the second charge were already established. The focus was accordingly only on the 
mens rea
 requirement. If the Prosecution could adduce sufficient evidence which was not inherently incredible, and which if accepted as accurate would prove that the appellant knew that these items he bought from Cheung and Sam were stolen property, the Prosecution would have established its 
prima facie
 case in respect of the first charge:
 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1980–1981] SLR 73
; 
Ng Theng Shuang v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
.
 
I noted that this was an “ordinary” case where there was no need to distinguish between the requirement of dishonesty and that of knowledge – 
ie
, the Prosecution did not need to establish a separate requirement of dishonesty. As for the second charge, if there was sufficient evidence at the close of the Prosecution’s case that the appellant had the requisite knowledge, it would necessarily follow that the mental requirement of “reason to believe that the property was stolen” was satisfied as well. This would in turn mean that a 
prima facie
 case had also been established for the second charge.
31       
 
During the trial in the court below, Lam’s testimony pointed to the fact that the appellant had mentioned that his watch was stolen property and that the appellant had told Cheung to take a rest, adding that “it had already been done for so long and the police would have known about it”. Further, there was Sam’s incriminating evidence against the appellant in his police statement. This evidence was not inherently incredible. It further led to the reasonable inference that the appellant had knowledge that the jewellery items he purchased from Cheung and Sam were stolen property. The Prosecution’s evidence was therefore of such a nature that, if unrebutted and accepted as true, would establish that the appellant had the requisite knowledge. Accordingly, the Prosecution had established a 
prima facie
 case and the district judge was correct to have called for the defence.

It should be pointed out that in respect of the 24 items identified by Julia on 25 April 2002, there was a dispute as to whether they were stolen property in the first place. Therefore, the Prosecution had the additional task of producing some evidence that was not inherently incredible and that if unrebutted would prove that the 24 items were stolen. To this end, the Prosecution had relied on the testimony of Julia herself, who identified the items as belonging to her. Quite clearly, a 
prima facie
 case was established as well in respect of these 24 pieces of jewellery.
Whether the appellant had knowledge that the jewellery items were stolen
Evidence of Lam and Sam
33       
 
One of the appellant’s main contentions was that the district judge had placed undue weight on the evidence of Lam. In particular, the appellant argued that the judge failed to consider that Lam might have had an incentive to give false evidence to incriminate the appellant because he had something to gain by co-operating with the Prosecution. However, the district judge had in fact clearly directed his mind to this possibility and had taken the view that since no more charges were pending against Lam, he could have no incentive to lie in order to favour the Prosecution. The appellant contended that there could be other reasons for Lam to co-operate with the Prosecution, such as the possibility of a remission of his sentence. Yet, remission of sentences are regulated by the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) and its Regulations, and a prisoner’s entitlement to remission is decided by the prison authorities. It was therefore not readily apparent how Lam’s co-operation with the Prosecution would lead to a remission of his sentence. In any event, the district judge had found Lam to be a frank and candid witness during the trial. In this regard, it cannot be over-emphasised that an appellate court, without having had the same advantage that the trial judge had in observing the witnesses’ demeanour under examination, should be slow to disagree with the trial judge as to the credibility of witnesses.
34       
 
The appellant further contended that the district judge had erred in relying on Lam’s evidence to come to the irresistible inference that the appellant was fully aware of Cheung’s nefarious activities. Although the judge did state as such in his judgment, it appeared to me on a proper reading of his reasoning that the judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite knowledge based on the totality of the evidence before him, and not based solely on Lam’s testimony. In particular, the judge also took into account Sam’s police statement.
35       
 
After an impeachment exercise, the district judge had allowed Sam’s statement to replace his testimony in court and to be admitted as evidence for the truth of the matter contained in the statement in accordance with s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). In determining the weight to be given to such a statement, s 147(6) of the same Act provides that regard is to be had to the contemporaneity of the statement with the occurrence of the facts stated therein, and also to the question of whether the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the fact. In 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
, I had noted at [27]:
The contemporaneity of a statement with an incident is important for it guards against inaccuracy. However, the degree of contemporaneity that is required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time. However, the recollection of the existence of a relationship, such as of employment, is not so malleable.
36       
 
Contrary to the appellant’s assertions, the district judge in the present case had explicitly taken into consideration the above factors in deciding what weight was to be attached to Sam’s statement. The judge had regard to the fact that there was only a period of less than two months between the making of the statement and the incident referred to therein, and that it was an isolated incident which was less susceptible to error. The appellant argued that Sam had an incentive to misrepresent the facts so as to shift the blame on to others, including the appellant. However, this argument was unsustainable because the statement actually incriminated Sam himself. The statement made reference to the fact that “we” committed “burglary”, and “we” must necessarily be interpreted to include Sam himself.
37       
 
Another point raised was that the appellant could not have made the incriminatory remarks which Lam and Sam said he had made, including in particular his alleged remarks about the fact that his Patek Phillipe watch was stolen property. However, it was not inconceivable that the appellant could have made such comments. If the nature of his relationship with the Hong Kong nationals was such that he knew that they were committing housebreaking and he was further buying the stolen property from them, there clearly did not seem to be any need for him to be guarded while in their presence.
38       
 
It ought also to be mentioned that Lam’s evidence was consistent with Sam’s in that both of them alleged that the appellant was wearing a stolen Patek Phillipe watch. The judge was perfectly entitled to make a finding that Lam’s testimony on this point corroborated what Sam had said in his statement.
Other circumstantial evidence
39       
 
The appellant challenged the district judge’s finding that the absence of proper documentation suggested illegitimacy in the transactions. I noted that the defence had explained that no documentation was required because it was the appellant and his wife’s personal business and there was therefore no need to account to any third party. Furthermore, one of the Defence witnesses testified that she had dealt with the appellant in the past without any documentation. However, as quite rightly put by the district judge, it was nonetheless odd that no records of any kind were kept at all for transactions involving such a large sum of money which, according to the appellant, amounted to about $130,000. Moreover, there was evidence that proper records were kept for transactions that were of much lesser value, such as those of about $20,000. In my opinion, the district judge was therefore perfectly entitled to draw the inference that the transactions were probably illegitimate based on the evidence before him.
40       
 
The appellant also contended that the district judge had fallen into error in not accepting the appellant’s claim that he had paid $130,000 for the jewellery pieces from Cheung and Lam, and that he had erred in striking down their business arrangement as being illogical. There was no real need to go through in detail the arguments canvassed by the appellant. The important point was that the district judge had reached his conclusions largely because of the inconsistent and conflicting testimony of the appellant, particularly in his explanations as to how the payments were made to Cheung and Lam. As I stated earlier, an appellate court should refrain from interfering with the district judge’s finding of fact, especially if it turns on the credibility of the witnesses.
41       
 
Furthermore, support for the district judge’s decision to take into account the above circumstantial evidence can be found in the case of 
Koh Hak Boon v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 427
, where a s 411 conviction was upheld under circumstances that were similar to those in the present case. In that case, large quantities of gold were sold at low prices with payment in cash and without any issue of certificates or receipts.
42        For the above reasons, the district judge was clearly entitled to find, based on the evidence before him, that the appellant knew the jewellery items to be stolen property.
Whether the 24 items seized on 25 April 2002 belonged to Julia
43        Two main objections were raised by the appellant in relation to this issue. The first related to the calling of rebuttal evidence. The second related to the weight that was placed on Julia’s testimony.
Rebuttal evidence
44       
 
Melissa Wong was called as a rebuttal witness by the Prosecution to prove that the bracelet she had sold to the appellant’s shop was white gold in colour and not yellow. This would mean that P16-0, one of the 24 items in question, was actually not purchased from Melissa Wong as alleged by the Defence since P16-0 was yellow in colour. The appellant contended that the district judge should not have allowed the Prosecution’s application to call Melissa Wong in rebuttal.
45       
 
The principles governing when rebuttal evidence is permitted are clearly established in civil cases. The judge has a discretion whether or not to allow rebuttal evidence to be called, and generally leave will be granted if the party seeking to call the rebuttal witness was misled or taken by surprise: 
Zainal bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian Michael
 
[1996] 3 SLR 121
. If a matter or development has quite unexpectedly arisen during trial which one party could not have reasonably anticipated, that party is permitted to call evidence in rebuttal: 
Alrich Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy (No 2)
 
[1994] 3 SLR 1
. These principles regarding rebuttal evidence have been extended to criminal trials: 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
[1998] 1 SLR 162
.
46        In the present case,
 
the test would therefore be whether there were any issues that surfaced during the trial which caught the Prosecution by surprise as something which could not be reasonably anticipated, and which necessitated the calling of Melissa Wong to rebut these new matters raised. It was only at trial during the cross-examination of Julia that the Defence first alluded to the fact that there had been a lady who was called to go down to the appellant’s shop to identify P16-0. Subsequently, Esther Tan, in the course of giving her testimony, identified this lady as Melissa Wong. It was at least arguable that the Prosecution could not have reasonably expected such a development in the Defence’s case. In these circumstances, there was no basis for interfering with the district judge’s exercise of discretion to allow such rebuttal evidence to be admitted.
Weight given to Julia’s evidence
47       
 
Julia had identified the 24 items as belonging to her on the day of the seizure (
ie
, 25 April 2002) and subsequently at trial, although she was less certain regarding eight of those items during the trial. The district judge relied on her evidence in reaching the conclusion that the 24 items were indeed hers and that they were stolen from her by Cheung and Sam. The appellant challenged this finding of fact on the ground that undue weight was given to Julia’s evidence and that insufficient regard was had to the testimony of Esther Tan. Esther Tan had given evidence to the effect that the 24 items of jewellery were purchased from other shops that were closing down. The situation was therefore one where there were conflicting versions of facts from the two witnesses as to the origins of the 24 items in question. In the case of
 
Ong Ting Ting v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 53
, I had stated at [27]:
… I was presented with directly contradictory versions of the events from the two main interested parties. As the final decision necessarily rested on the acceptance of one account over the other, I gave due regard to the fact that the district judge had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses in court when he assessed the credibility of their evidence. Given the circumstances, the appellant obviously faced an uphill task in convincing me that the district judge’s findings should be set aside.
48       
 
Bearing the above approach in mind, I took the view that the decision of the district judge to prefer Julia’s evidence over Esther Tan’s should not be disturbed. In any event, there were indications that the district judge had carefully scrutinised their testimonies, and cogent justifications were given in the learned judge’s judgment as to why he chose to accept Julia’s testimony and reject Esther Tan’s. In particular, Julia was able to give consistent accounts of the history behind each of the 24 items. In contrast, it would have been very difficult for Esther Tan to specifically distinguish these 24 items from the large number of jewellery pieces that she dealt with in her everyday business. Moreover, the judge was influenced by the fact that Esther Tan could not remember the colour of the bracelet that was sold to her by Melissa Wong, since the latter testified in rebuttal for the Prosecution that she had actually sold a white gold bracelet to the appellant’s shop and not a yellow one as alleged by Esther Tan.
49        Therefore, in my opinion, there was no basis to interfere with the district judge’s finding that the 24 pieces of jewellery in question belonged to Julia and were stolen from her.
Conclusion
50       
 
This appeal was, in the main, a challenge against the lower court’s findings of fact and assessment of evidence. The appellant had not provided any convincing reasons as to why the district judge’s findings ought to be reversed. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.

8 November 2004
 
Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          This was an application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) to make absolute an order to show cause under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”). The respondent, Colin Caines, did not attend the hearing. After hearing counsel for the Law Society, we granted the application and ordered the respondent to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now give our reasons.
Facts
2          The facts of this case were undisputed. The respondent was an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. At all material times, he was practising as a sole proprietor in the firm M/s Khosa & Caines (“the firm”). 
3          On 6 June 2002, the Commercial Affairs Department received a complaint against the respondent from one of his clients, Diana Chan Sun Sun (“Diana Chan”), alleging that he had misappropriated moneys entrusted to him as a stakeholder. Subsequent investigations revealed that the respondent had made a number of unauthorised withdrawals from the firm’s clients’ account. The account was finally closed on 31 December 2001 with a nil balance, and no restitution was made to any of the respondent’s clients.
4          On 2 September 2002, the respondent pleaded guilty and was convicted on four charges of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The facts relating to each of the four charges are briefly set out below.
The first charge (DAC 30465/02)
5          The respondent acted for Diana Chan and Richard Kong Guan Huat in the sale of their matrimonial property. He was appointed as stakeholder of the sale proceeds pending a decision from the court as to the division of the moneys. On or about 4 July 2001, the respondent received a $2,000 deposit from the purchaser. A further $180,410.51 was received on 29 September 2001, and the total sum of $182,410.51 was deposited into the firm’s clients’ account. However, instead of retaining the money on behalf of his clients, the respondent dishonestly misappropriated it to his own use.  
The third charge (DAC 34120/02)
6          The respondent was engaged by Lim Wong Choong (“Lim”) to represent him in a third party claim for damages from NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative Limited (“NTUC”) after Lim’s vehicle was involved in an accident. On or about 29 August 2001, NTUC paid the respondent $8,200 as settlement for Lim’s claim. The money was deposited into the firm’s clients’ account, but was later withdrawn by the respondent to pay for his personal debts and expenses.
The fifth charge (DAC 34122/02)
7          The respondent also represented Yeo Soh Choo (“Yeo”) in her third party claim for damages arising from a traffic accident. The insurance company, India International Insurance Pte Ltd, paid the respondent $4,500 as partial settlement of Yeo’s claim on or about 11 April 2001. On 16 June 2001, a further $440 was received. The total sum of $4,940 was also misappropriated by the respondent.
The eleventh charge (DAC 34128/02)
8          The respondent acted for Fortunecom, which was sued by Nokia Corporation and Nokia Mobile Phones Ltd (collectively referred to as “Nokia”) over their unauthorised use of the “Nokia” trademark. Fortunecom agreed to pay $4,000 to Nokia to settle the legal proceedings, and the respondent persuaded Fortunecom’s representative to make the payment in cash. On or about 19 July 2001, Fortunecom entrusted the respondent with $4,000 cash. Instead of paying the money over to Nokia, the respondent kept the money for himself. 
9          All in all, the respondent dishonestly misappropriated at least $199,550.51 of his clients’ moneys. Seven other charges were also taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation before the district judge, the respondent highlighted his contributions to the Law Society, his remorse by pleading guilty at the first available opportunity and his medical history. Balancing these factors with the seriousness of the offences, the substantial amounts of money involved and the respondent’s failure to make restitution, the district judge sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment on the first charge and 12 months’ imprisonment on each of the remaining charges. The sentences for the first and third charges were ordered to run consecutively, bringing his total sentence to four years’ imprisonment.
The show cause proceedings
10        As the respondent was convicted of offences involving fraud and dishonesty, the Law Society was obliged under s 94A of the LPA to make an application for him to show cause as to why he should not be dealt with under s 83(1). The Law Society argued that due cause had been shown under s 83(2)(a) of the LPA, which provides that: 
Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession.
11        Section 83(6) of the LPA clearly states that this court must accept the respondent’s conviction as final and conclusive. It was thus not open to either the respondent or this court to go behind his convictions: 
Re Mohomed Jiffry Muljee
 
[1994] 3 SLR 520
; 
Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh
 
[1996] 2 SLR 184
.
12        Of course, it does not follow that every conviction of a criminal offence implies a defect of character that renders an advocate and solicitor unfit for his profession: 
Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee
 
[2003] 3 SLR 209
. The nature of the offence, and the circumstances in which it was committed, must be scrutinised. Nonetheless, the facts of the present case were straightforward. The respondent had deliberately betrayed the trust of his clients and misappropriated their money for his personal use. Given that the offences involved dishonesty committed in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor, that was sufficient in itself to demonstrate that due cause had been shown: 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
[2004] 2 SLR 261
.
Appropriate order to be made
13        We then turned to consider the appropriate order to be made under s 83(1) of the LPA, which reads:
All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause shown to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding 5 years or censured.
14        The respondent was not present to make submissions on any mitigating factors. In any case, we found that any mitigating factors, even if present, would have been of little avail. Where a solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence, the court has almost invariably, no matter how strong the mitigating factors, chosen to strike the offending solicitor off the roll: 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
, following 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
[1996] 1 SLR 696
.
15        While the mitigating factors raised by the respondent before the district judge may have been relevant to the criminal proceedings, they did not carry the same weight in this disciplinary action. While criminal proceedings are essentially punitive in nature, disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA serves a variety of functions. Besides punishment of the errant solicitor, disciplinary action is also aimed at deterring other like-minded solicitors from similar defaults and ensuring the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice: 
Law Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick
 
[1999] 4 SLR 168
. In a case where an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence involving dishonesty, the paramount considerations must be the protection of the public and the preservation of the good name of the profession: 
Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Caleb Charles James
 
[2004] 2 SLR 256
, following 
Law Society of Singapore v Wee Wei Fen
 
[2000] 1 SLR 234
.
16        These considerations weighed heavily in our minds in the present case. Solicitors are frequently entrusted with large amounts of money as part of their professional obligations, and members of the public must have confidence in the integrity of the solicitors in whom they repose so much of their trust. This confidence has been shaken by the recent spate of incidents involving errant solicitors who, blinded by avarice and desperation, have completely disregarded their professional obligations and chosen to steal from the very people whose interests they are meant to protect. Given the worrying prevalence of such deplorable conduct, we found it necessary to send a strong message that such misbehaviour would not be tolerated. As L P Thean JA opined in 
Re Nirmal Singh s/o Fauja Singh
 
[2001] 3 SLR 608
 at [20]:
The court must be every bit as jealous of the honour of those admitted to the Singapore legal profession as a man is of his own reputation, for the integrity of the profession is dependant wholly on the character and virtue of its members. At the same time, we must be conscious of the ever-compelling need to protect the public from errant lawyers and the serious harm which such lawyers could inflict on the public and the reputation of the legal profession.
17        The respondent’s conduct in the present case warranted nothing less than a striking-off order. The amounts he misappropriated were substantial and could hardly be dismissed as isolated incidents. He was convicted of four charges, and no less than seven other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. He had obviously embarked on a deliberate and dishonest scheme to defraud his clients and, to this day, has failed to make restitution to any one of them. The practice of law is an honourable profession that demands the highest degree of integrity and trustworthiness from its members. The respondent’s appalling conduct demonstrated that he was entirely unfit to remain on the roll of advocates and solicitors. In our opinion, the only appropriate order was one of striking the respondent off the roll of advocates and solicitors.
Conclusion
18        In the event, we made absolute the order to show cause and ordered the respondent to be struck off the roll. We further ordered that he should bear the costs of these proceedings.

Yong Pung How CJ
 
(delivering the judgment of the court):
1         
 
This was an application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to make absolute an order to show cause. We granted the application and ordered the respondent, Philip Yap Shao Sin, to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now set out our reasons.
Facts
2         
 
The facts of this case were undisputed. The respondent was an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. At all material times, he was practising as a sole proprietor in the firm of M/s Philip Yap & Partners.
3            Sometime in 1993,
 
Lim Jew Kann (“the complainant”) and his father Lim Hong Min (“the victim”) decided to purchase a private apartment, which was proposed to be erected at No 5 Jalan Masjid #04-03, Kembangan Court, Singapore. They applied to the Overseas Union Bank for a loan. They were recommended to appoint the respondent as their solicitor to transact all subsequent matters relating to the purchase of the apartment.
4            Towards the end of 1993, the victim executed a purchase agreement with the apartment developer, LKN Development Pte Ltd. Following this, the complainant and the victim met the respondent at his law firm, whereupon the respondent asked for the sum of $31,200.52. He explained that $7,255.02 of this were his legal fees, $22,145.50 were the stamp fees and $1,800 were the survey fees required to purchase the apartment.
5          The victim agreed to the amount and thereupon issued a cheque for the $31,200.52, made payable to the respondent’s law firm.
6          
The respondent banked the victim’s cheque at the Bank of China to open a current account in his own name. After that, he made use of the victim’s money to make payments, all of which were either for the payment of the respondent’s personal credit card bills or for his personal cash withdrawals.
7         
 
In August 1996, the victim received, via courier service, documents relating to his purchase of the apartment and a note, addressed to him by the respondent, stating that the respondent had ceased acting for the victim in relation to the purchase of the apartment. Subsequently, in December 1996, the victim received a letter from the developer stating that they had yet to receive the stamp fees from the respondent amounting to $19,232. This was to have been the final payment to complete the purchase of the apartment.
8          
The complainant lodged a police report alleging that the victim had paid a sum of $31,200.52 to the respondent for the purchase of a private apartment but that the respondent had failed to fulfil his responsibility as the lawyer and had not repaid any money to the complainant.
9          T
he respondent was charged with committing criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The charge read:
You, Philip Yap Shao Sin, Male 42 years, NRIC No S 1424518/I, are charged that you, between 16
th
 November 1993 and 14
th
 February 1994, in Singapore, being entrusted with a certain property, to wit cash amounting to S$19,232, in the way of your business as an attorney, did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of such property, by dishonestly converting the said amount of cash to your own use, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
10        
On 5 March 2003, the respondent pleaded guilty in a district court to the charge, and on 25 April 2003, he was sentenced by the district judge to 12 months’ imprisonment.
The show cause proceedings
11        
As the respondent was convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, the Law Society in accordance with s 94A(1) of the Act applied under s 98(1) for
 
and obtained an order that
 
the respondent
 
be made
 
to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83(1) of the Act. Under
 
s 83(1), an errant advocate and solicitor can be struck off the roll, suspended from practice or censured, if due cause has been shown.
 
The respondent was not represented, nor was he present at the hearing to make any submissions before us on this point.
12        Under s 83(6), a court of three judges must accept the respondent’s conviction as final and conclusive: 
Law Society of Singapore v Junaini bin Manin
 
[2004] SGHC 200
 (“
Junaini bin Manin
”); 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
[2004] 2 SLR 261
 (“
Loh Wai Mun Daniel
”).
 
The sole question for the court’s determination is what consequences should flow from the fact that the respondent had committed the offences for which he was convicted:
 
Law Society of Singapore v Wee Wei Fen
 
[2000] 1 SLR 234
 (“
Wee Wei Fen
”).
13            Section 83(2)(a) provides that due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor “has been convicted of a criminal offence, 
implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession
” [emphasis added].
 The fact that the respondent 
was convicted of an offence involving dishonesty committed in his capacity as advocate and solicitor was, in itself, sufficient for the court to determine that due cause had been shown under s 83(2)(a):
 
Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
and 
Law Society of Singapore v Sarjit Singh s/o Mehar Singh
 
[2004] SGHC 51
. As such,
 
the sole issue that concerned this court
 
was the determination of the appropriate order to be made under s 83(1)
 
of the Act.
Appropriate order to be made
14        It is well established that where a solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence involving fraud or dishonesty, the court has almost invariably, no matter how strong the mitigating factors, chosen to strike a solicitor off the roll: 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
[1999] 1 SLR 696
, followed in 
Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 and 
Junaini bin Manin
.
15        Such a conviction unquestionably carries with it an implication that the respondent lacked the level of integrity and trustworthiness required of a solicitor. In this case, the respondent dishonestly converted funds, that the victim had entrusted to him, for his personal use. As a result, he had violated the trust that had been placed in him as the victim’s solicitor.
16        The court also took into account the fact that this dishonest act had been committed in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and deserved to be dealt with accordingly:

; 
Law Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick
 
[1999] 4 SLR 168
;

;

. There was no reason to depart from the norm.
17        The respondent was not present at the hearing to make any submissions on mitigating factors. However, the presence of mitigating factors would have been of little avail. The settled position is that in cases of proven dishonesty, mitigating factors do not tilt the balance towards the more lenient sanctions of suspension or of censure except where they are consistent with the objectives of preserving the good name of the legal profession and of the protection of the public: 
Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Caleb Charles James

; 
Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam

. Indeed, where a case involves an offender of proven dishonesty, the weight to be attached to a plea in mitigation is negligible and a striking off will be the consequence as a matter of course:

.
18        For the foregoing reasons, we granted the Law Society’s application to make the show cause order absolute, and ordered the respondent to be struck off the roll. We further ordered that he should bear the costs of these proceedings.
Order accordingly.",2004-11-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

MPH Rubin J:
1          The appellant was convicted in the court below on five charges of committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The first charge pertained to a single act of anal intercourse committed by the appellant on the first victim (“V1”) on 1 April 2003. The subsequent charges were derived from four separate instances where the appellant committed acts of anal intercourse on the second victim (“V2”), over the period spanning the months of January and February of 2003. The appellant was sentenced to a total of 14 years’ imprisonment. He appealed solely against his conviction. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
The facts
2          At the material time, the appellant, then aged 25, had rented a flat at Block 316 Woodlands St 31, #11-124 (“the appellant’s residence”). He conspired with an accomplice (“P3”), who knew the two victims, V1, then aged 16, and V2, then aged 15, such that the two would be manipulated into engaging in anal intercourse with him. The appellant’s plan succeeded and gave rise to the five charges in this appeal.
The Prosecution’s case
Facts pertaining to the first charge
3          On 31 March 2003, P3 requested that V1 help him pass a bottle of mineral water to his god-brother, the appellant. The bottle supposedly contained a mixture of mineral water and “holy water” that P3 had obtained from a temple. V1 complied with P3’s request and delivered the bottle to the appellant that evening. That same day, P3 again contacted V1 and arranged for them to visit the appellant at the appellant’s residence at 6.00am the following morning.
4          On 1 April 2003, V1 made his way to the appellant’s flat. Along the way, V1 received a call from P3 and was told that the latter would be unable to reach the appellant’s residence on time. V1 was subsequently told to proceed to meet the appellant alone. Upon reaching the appellant’s flat, V1 was again contacted by P3 and instructed to give the previous night’s bottle of mineral water to the appellant to drink. V1 located the bottle and got the appellant to drink from it.
5          Upon consuming the contents of the bottle, the appellant started to complain of giddiness. V1 quickly contacted P3 to inform him of the appellant’s condition. It was at this time that P3 told V1 that the water had caused the appellant to have the “urge” and that the only way for V1 to save the appellant was to engage in anal intercourse with him. V1 refused to do such a thing and hung up on P3. V1 then called another friend (“P4”) and requested that P4 meet him at the appellant’s flat to keep him company. However, when the appellant discovered that P4 had arrived at the flat, he scolded P4 and V1, chasing P4 away after declaring that the matter was solely between V1 and himself.
6          After P4 left the premises, the appellant accused V1 of causing his condition and threatened to report V1 to the police unless he consumed certain blue and orange tablets. V1, having recently been released on probation from a boy’s hostel, was frightened of the prospect of being reported to the police and complied with the appellant’s orders. The tablets caused V1 to feel drowsy and he soon fell asleep.
7          When he regained consciousness, V1 discovered that he lay completely naked on the appellant’s bed. The appellant, who was also naked, was facing him and had both V1’s legs on his shoulders. V1 then realised that the appellant was having anal intercourse with him. He tried to resist but did not have the strength to push the appellant away. It was only when the appellant stopped and exited the bedroom that V1 retrieved his clothing and proceed to the toilet to clean himself. While walking to the toilet, he noticed P3 and the appellant in the living room. After he finished bathing, V1 confronted both P3 and the appellant over his treatment. P3 explained that he had induced V1 to engage in the act of anal intercourse in order to get the appellant to amend his will to reflect P3 as his beneficiary. When V1 followed up by demanding to know what that had to do with him, the appellant scolded P3. V1 then asked P3 to open the door to the appellant’s residence and left the premises.
8          Subsequently, the appellant contacted V1 and on the pretext that he had, in the process of having anal intercourse with V1, transferred some of his “
qi
” (a form of internal energy) to V1, demanded that V1 return the “
qi
” to him by engaging in further anal intercourse. V1 refused the appellant’s demands and eventually revealed what had transpired on 1 April 2003 to P4. On P4’s advice, V1 went with his father to lodge a police report against the appellant on 7 April 2003.
Facts pertaining to the second to fifth charges
9          On 24 January 2003, P3 informed V2 that a friend of his required money to repay some debts. They hatched a plan to steal money from the appellant and arranged to visit the appellant’s residence. According to the plan, P3 would lure the appellant out of his bedroom while V2 stole the money from his wallet. They executed their plan the following day.
10        Unfortunately, after V2 had managed to remove some dollar notes from the appellant’s wallet, the appellant returned to his bedroom and checked the contents of his wallet. He discovered the theft and searched both V2 and P3. He then compared the serial numbers on the dollar notes he found on V2’s person with a list that he kept in his wallet. After proving that the money belonged to him, the appellant threatened to make a police report. V2 pleaded with the appellant and ended up writing a note promising not to steal again (“the note”). The note, dated 25 January 2003, bore V2’s signature and thumbprint.
11        After the note was kept by P3, the appellant instructed V2 and P3 to strip naked. The appellant then commenced practising his “
qigong
” (a Chinese method of controlling internal energy). V2 complied with these instructions only because he wanted to get the note back from the appellant. He was told to lie on the bed in order for the appellant to feel his pulse and inspect his veins. At this point in time, P3 took out the appellant’s camera and began to take some pictures. When V2 queried about the camera, he was told by P3 that there was no film inside.
12        Having taken a few photographs of V2, P3 put on some clothing and straddled V2’s stomach with his back facing V2. Squatting over V2’s stomach, P3 raised both of V2’s legs, at which time V2 felt some pain in his anus. When P3 dismounted from his position, V2 saw that the appellant was having anal intercourse with him. P3 then resumed taking pictures of V2 as the appellant had anal intercourse with him.
13        When V2 subsequently complained of stomach pains, the appellant stopped and allowed V2 to visit the toilet. Upon returning to the living room from the toilet, P3 told V2 that the appellant had sustained some internal injuries and that V2 could help to treat these injuries by continuing to engage in anal intercourse with the appellant. If V2 cooperated, the note would be returned to him.
14        Subsequently, V2 visited the appellant on three other occasions. Each time V2 visited, the appellant would apply something from a blue tube onto his penis and V2’s anus before commencing anal intercourse with him. V2 testified at trial that several tubes of Durex brand “Top Gel” seized from the appellant’s residence and the appellant’s room in his mother’s flat were identical to the tube used by the appellant on each of those occasions. He also confirmed that the photographs marked P12 to P16, which were developed from the roll of film found in the appellant’s room in his mother’s flat, were those P3 had taken during the first incident on 25 January 2003.
15        Sometime in March 2003, the discipline master of V2’s school confiscated a copy of the note executed by V2 from some of the school’s students. The discipline master lodged a police report and it was then that an investigating officer approached V2. This led to the uncovering of the appellant’s sordid acts.
Corroborative evidence of P3
16        P3’s testimony essentially corroborated both victims’ accounts of the facts. Furthermore, P3 admitted that he had conspired with the appellant to induce V1 and V2 into engaging in their respective acts with the appellant.
17        In relation to the first charge, P3 revealed that he and the appellant had concocted two plans to trick V1 into having anal intercourse with the appellant. Ultimately, only the second plan was executed, the details of which largely corresponded to the 
modus operandi
 of the appellant as related by V1.
18        P3 also testified that he had arrived at the appellant’s residence at about 9.00am on 1 April 2003 and had observed the appellant apply gel to his penis and the anus of the then unconscious V1. P3 had left the bedroom when the appellant was about to place his penis into V1’s anus.
19        As to the second to fifth charges, P3 admitted that the appellant had instructed him to conspire with V2 to steal money from the appellant’s wallet. P3’s version of the failed attempt to steal the appellant’s money also corresponded to V2’s version of the facts. In addition, P3 also gave evidence of how he had taken the various pictures of V2 and the appellant, and further, how he had held on to V2’s legs while the appellant applied a tube of cream to his penis and V2’s anus. In particular, P3 testified as to how he had taken more pictures of V2 and the appellant as the latter penetrated V2.
20        It should be noted that P3 denied colluding with any persons, including the two victims, to frame the appellant. P3 also denied having set the appellant up in order to extort money from him.
21        Relying on the testimonies of the three witnesses above, the medical and psychiatric evidence of the various expert witnesses, and the appellant’s various statements to the police, the Prosecution submitted that it had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
The appellant’s case
22        The appellant denied any collusion with P3 and asserted that the commission of the various acts against the two victims never took place. Additionally, the appellant advanced two possible bases to explain the complaints made against him. First, he claimed that the account by V1, V2 and P3 formed part of an elaborate attempt by one Lim Hock Gin (“Lim”) to seek revenge against the appellant for having successfully lodged a Magistrate’s Complaint against him sometime in April 2003. Second, he alleged that the entire episode was part of a ploy by P3 to extort money from the appellant.
The decision below
23        The trial judge observed that the main issue for determination was a question of fact, 
ie
, whether the appellant did in fact engage in carnal intercourse with V1 and V2. He further reminded himself of the correct approach in dealing with the evidence, especially the testimony of the complainants, in cases involving sex offences as expounded by the High Court in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
.
24        After conducting a comprehensive review of the evidence of the two victims and P3, the trial judge concluded that all three witnesses were truthful and credible. In particular, he noted that the accounts given by V1 and V2 as to the circumstances leading to the accused having committed carnal intercourse on them were “detailed, credible and unusually convincing”. Their explanations as to their states of mind and their subsequent conduct after the initial incidents with the appellant were found to be entirely reasonable.
25        The trial judge emphasised that whilst V1 and V2 had narrated different accounts of how the accused had coerced them into having anal intercourse with him, the common thread in their evidence was the perverse manner in which the appellant had disguised his acts as transferring “
qi
” to them. According to the trial judge, this suggested that any conspiracy between them to “fix” the accused was extremely remote. Furthermore, he formed the view that the details of the respective incidents of anal intercourse could not have been “fabrications or [formed] as a result of their imagination”.
26        It was likewise noted by the trial judge that the testimonies of V1 and V2 were substantially corroborated by not only the physical exhibits seized from both the appellant’s residence and his mother’s flat, but also by the medical and psychiatric evidence and the testimony given by P3. It was further observed that there could not have been any conspiracy to falsely implicate the appellant.
27        While the trial judge did record that there were some discrepancies between the testimonies of V1, V2, P3 and P4, he concluded that those discrepancies were insignificant and did not undermine the strength of the cumulative evidence of these witnesses.
28        As for the appellant’s evidence, the trial judge found that the appellant was a wholly unreliable witness who had no compunction about lying when confronted with difficult questions. He was satisfied that the two bases advanced by the appellant to explain the circumstances surrounding the charges were conjectures at best. The appellant’s bare denial of the facts was unsustainable in light of the evidence produced by the Prosecution, as well as the fact that the appellant’s various statements to the police were clearly at odds with his allegations of conspiracy and extortion. In addition, the trial judge was of the view that, even if no meaningful identification of the accused could be made from the photographs which showed a person engaging in anal intercourse with V2, the person seen in the photographs was none other than the appellant.
29        In the end, the trial judge held that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt on all five charges and convicted the appellant. He reviewed the sentencing precedents set by the Court of Appeal and, in light of all the aggravating factors in the present case, sentenced the appellant to seven years’ imprisonment for each charge with two of the sentences running consecutively.
The appeal
30        The appellant appealed solely against his conviction, disputing the trial judge’s findings of fact.
31        The grounds of appeal can be conveniently separated into two segments: first, grounds that go towards the alleged weakness in the Prosecution’s case; and second, grounds that challenge the trial judge’s finding as to the viability of the appellant’s defences.
32        As counsel for the appellant has raised many contentions with regard to each of the two categories defined above, I shall deal only with the general principles that will aptly dispose of this appeal. Where appropriate, I shall highlight certain more pertinent submissions that require particular treatment.
33        Before coming to the substance of the appeal itself, it will be beneficial to first address certain preliminary issues that an appellate court should bear in mind when assessing the findings of a lower court.
Preliminary issues
The role of an appellate court
34        First and foremost, it is a settled principle that the role of an appellate court is not to determine whether it would, in light of all the evidence placed before it, come to the same conclusion as the trial judge below. The function of the appellate court is to determine if the trial judge had, in arriving at any finding of fact, reached a conclusion that was sustainable on all the evidence. An appellate court will not therefore disturb the findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
.
35        Furthermore, as the trial judge’s findings of fact were largely dependent upon his assessment of the credibility of the two victims and P3, it must be borne in mind that “an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence”: 
PP v Yeoh Choon Poh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 at 878, [45]. Therefore, the credibility of a witness, and, accordingly, the veracity of the witness’s testimony, cannot be derived solely from his or her conduct when placed on the stand. In determining credibility, it is the duty of the trial court to test the witness’s testimony against the objective facts and independent evidence: 
PP v Victor Rajoo
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
.
 It is therefore the role of an appellate court to scrutinise the trial judge’s treatment of each witness’s evidence when deciding his or her credibility. However, once it is shown that the lower court had assessed the witness’s evidence in accordance with the test laid down in the cases, an appellate court should generally be slow in overturning the findings of fact which hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
Corroboration
36        A question arises whether there was a need for the lower court to issue a corroboration warning when it received the evidence of V1, V2 and P3. While neither the appellant nor the Prosecution raised this issue, by virtue of the prosecution witnesses falling within the established categories of witnesses requiring corroboration warning, the interests of justice warranted some treatment of this matter. As to both victims, it would appear that they fall within the broad category of “children”. P3, on the other hand, can be viewed either as an “accomplice” or a “child”.
37        In so far as all three witnesses are deemed “children”, the courts have decisively held that there exists no special principle requiring a court to issue a corroboration warning where a “child” is concerned: 
Lee Kwang Peng v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 278
.
 All that is required is that the trial judge be satisfied that the “child” witness is “mature and reliable”, such that the testimony given may be accepted without any corroboration: 
Osman bin Ramli v PP
 
[2002] 4 SLR 1
.
 To this end, it is evident from the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision (
[2004] SGDC 197
 at [179]) that he was convinced that the evidence of V1 and V2 “could not have been a fabrication or … a result of their imagination”. Furthermore, he had evaluated the evidence of P3 and declared him to be a “witness of truth”.
38        With regard to V1 and V2 being “complainants of sexual offences”, it has been held that the court will treat the evidence of a “child” no differently from that of an adult complainant. Essentially, the court will concern itself with whether the evidence of such witnesses is reliable or unusually compelling, while bearing in mind the fact that children, depending on their level of maturity, may at times be unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality: 
B v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 400
.
 In particular, Yong Pung How CJ noted in 
Lee Kwang Peng v PP
 that, where an allegation of collusion is shown to be a sham defence, the court is entitled to convict the accused on the weight of the testimony of two complainants provided that each complainant’s evidence is “unusually convincing” when viewed on its own, or, where each complainant’s evidence is not “unusually convincing”, such complainants’ evidence can be supplemented by some other evidence capable of meeting the standard of proof required of the Prosecution. As the appellant’s claims to an alleged “conspiracy” and “attempted extortion” were, on a survey of the evidence in totality, found to be purely conjecture at best, the court would have been entitled to convict the appellant on the sole weight of both victims’ testimony. This was especially so in light of the trial judge’s finding that the accounts of both V1 and V2 as to the circumstances leading to the alleged offences were “detailed, credible and unusually convincing”.
39        Notwithstanding the above, there was also the additional corroboration from P3’s testimony. While P3 may be treated as an “accomplice”, it is settled law that whether or not the evidence of an accomplice was unworthy of credit and thus needed to be treated with caution was entirely discretionary: 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
.
 As the lower court had observed P3 to be honest in his answers in respect of his association with the appellant and the manner in which he had betrayed the two victims, there was no reason to treat his evidence as unreliable.
40        In light of the circumstances surrounding the evidence of all three prosecution witnesses, I was of the view that there was no danger of convicting the appellant on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of V1 and V2. Be that as it may, I think that the trial judge was eminently right in stating that P3’s evidence not only corroborated the two victims’ testimonies, but further reinforced the collective strength of the evidence as a whole. I now move to the substantive grounds of appeal.
Grounds of appeal
Inadequacies of the Prosecution’s case
Disparity in the details relating to the acts of anal intercourse
41        The crucial issue involves establishing whether the appellant had engaged in anal intercourse with the two victims. Any discrepancies in either victim’s evidence in this regard could consequently result in the unravelling of the Prosecution’s case. This aspect thus warrants particular treatment.
42        In respect of the act committed by the appellant against V1, counsel for the appellant submitted that several discrepancies arose in V1’s evidence. I shall only deal with those pertinent to the material elements of the charge. First, there was a disparity between V1 and P4’s evidence as to the position that V1 was in when the appellant penetrated him; second, V1’s evidence that he had struggled against the appellant conflicted with the medical evidence establishing the absence of lax anal tone or tears; third, V1 had merely related to the doctor who examined him that he had felt pain in his anus when he regained consciousness and had failed to mention that anyone had had anal intercourse with him.
43        The apparent disparity between V1 and P4’s version of events arose because V1 had maintained that he was on his back with the appellant facing him, whereas P4’s evidence was that V1 had recounted to him that the appellant had penetrated V1 from behind. It should be noted, however, that the trial judge had addressed his mind to the discrepancies between V1’s evidence and that of P4, but ultimately decided they were immaterial. The trial judge was entitled to believe V1’s version of the facts over P4’s as V1’s evidence was independently corroborated by P3. Furthermore, the rest of P4’s evidence largely corresponded with V1’s evidence.
44        As to the absence of any lax anal tone or tears sustained by V1, the medical evidence stated that this finding could either correspond with an absence of anal intercourse, or merely be the consequence of “gentle intercourse” with the use of lubrication. V1’s physical condition must be viewed in light of his evidence that he had consumed sedatives and that he was in a relatively weak condition when he first regained consciousness. It was also P3’s evidence that the appellant had applied gel to his penis and V1’s anus before commencing the act of anal intercourse. It was entirely plausible that V1’s struggles amounted to only the slightest of resistance to the appellant, resulting in V1 sustaining no physical injuries. I was therefore of the view that the trial judge was perfectly justified in finding that V1’s physical condition corresponded with his version of events.
45        In relation to V1’s failure to mention to the medical examiner that he had engaged in anal intercourse with the appellant, I found the issue to be misconceived as V1 was only obliged to tell the doctor which part of his body hurt. There was no need for V1 to relate the sordid details of his encounter with the appellant to the doctor.
46        The next contention raised by the appellant related to acts allegedly committed against V2. It was submitted that the photographs (P12 to P16) taken by P3 did not identify the appellant as the person engaged in anal intercourse with V2. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the photographs failed to capture the face of the offender and were thus inconclusive. The appellant also maintained that there were disparities between the pictures taken of the alleged offender and those taken of the appellant that were subsequently submitted by the defence at trial (D10 and D11). Particular emphasis was placed by the appellant on the absence of distinguishing physical characteristics on the alleged offender such as the mole on the appellant’s right forearm, and the presence of protruding veins on the arm of the alleged offender, where the appellant had none. These disparities, it was submitted, were sufficient to displace the trial judge’s finding that the appellant and the offender were one and the same. The appellant also submitted that the trial judge’s refusal to allow the Defence to cross-examine V2 on the disparity between the physical traits of the appellant and the alleged offender had rendered any conclusion on this evidence prejudicial and unsafe.
47        Notwithstanding the above, I agree with the trial judge’s observation that an extensive comparison of the pictures of the appellant and those of the alleged offender would be devoid of any meaning for the simple reason that the circumstances and conditions under which the two sets of photographs were taken were completely different. A cursory review of the photographs themselves made it clear that the angle from which the appellant’s photographs was taken was different from that which was taken of the alleged offender. Any conclusion reached as to the disparity between the two would be speculative at best. At most, one could possibly reach the conclusion that the overall frame and build of the appellant did somewhat match that of the alleged offender. In any event, the fact that the photographs produced in court showed a partially visible male Chinese, who looked disturbingly like the appellant, engaging in an indecent act with V2, lent weight to the evidence of both P3 and V2 that the alleged offender was none other than the appellant. In the circumstances, the trial judge was perfectly justified in concluding, with the benefit of V2 and P3’s testimonies, that the person in the photographs was the appellant.
Erroneous assessment of the credibility of the two victims and P3
48        A substantial portion of the appellant’s submissions was devoted to challenging this aspect of the trial judge’s findings. The discrepancies raised by the appellant included issues such as V1’s “violent background” and why he allowed the appellant to restrain him; the inconsistencies between V2 and P3’s evidence as to where they had met before proceeding to the appellant’s residence; and the “failure” on P3’s part to mention whether he saw the appellant penetrate V2 when P3 had already given evidence that he took photographs of the appellant and V2 as they engaged in anal intercourse. If anything, the appellant’s submissions in this respect merely established that there were minor inconsistencies in the witnesses’ evidence. In so far as their testimonies concerned the method in which the appellant had coerced the victims into engaging in anal intercourse, the events which led to the commission of the various offences and the manner in which the appellant had committed these heinous acts, I was of the opinion that the witnesses’ evidence formed a seamless rendering of what truly transpired.
49        The legal position on inconsistent testimony is clear. The presence of minor inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses does not lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Prosecution has failed to satisfy its burden of proof: 
Balasundaram s/o Suppiah v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 182
.
 Furthermore, the court is entitled to reject certain parts of a witness’s testimony so long as it does not detract from the witness’s evidence on the material aspects of the Prosecution’s case: 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
.
 The existence of various immaterial discrepancies was therefore not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. Rather, the trial judge was justified in arriving at his conclusion that the strength of the collective evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses remained intact. In view of the above findings and the test I had alluded to at [35] above, it cannot be said that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of the victims and P3’s credibility.
The voluntariness of the appellant’s statements to the police
50        The records showed that at one stage in the proceedings, the appellant had claimed that some aspects of his statements were involuntary. The Prosecution immediately suggested to the court that it should hold a 
voir dire
 to determine whether the statements were voluntary or otherwise. However, before a ruling could be made, the then counsel for the appellant rose to assuage the court that the statements were in fact voluntarily given and that the appellant would not be disputing voluntariness. The court below ultimately decided to proceed with the trial of the accused without holding any 
voir dire
. The appellant’s present counsel, however, submitted that a 
voir dire
 ought to have been conducted and that the failure to do so was a miscarriage of justice.
51        Criminal procedure requires that any statement sought to be admitted must first be shown to be voluntarily made. This is a burden that is placed on the Prosecution. Even where, as in the present case, counsel for the appellant did not challenge the admissibility of the statements at the trial below, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to conduct a 
voir dire
 when the testimony of the appellant indicates that an objection is in effect being made to the admissibility of such statements. This proposition was implicit in the reasoning of Chang Min Tat J in the case of 
Lee Weng Sang v PP
 
[1978] 1 MLJ 168
 and was subsequently endorsed by the Court of Appeal in 
Teo Yeow Chuah v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 563
.
52        In my opinion, an unequivocal declaration by the then counsel for the appellant at the trial below, confirming that there was no challenge as to the voluntariness of the appellant’s statements to the police, most certainly put paid to the appellant’s present counsel’s contention that the trial judge ought to have conducted a 
voir dire
. Given the making of such a positive declaration at the trial below, any present criticism that the trial judge had erred in not holding a trial within a trial was found by me to be unmeritorious on the facts of this present appeal. A note of caution is perhaps appropriate at this stage. I do not intend for the above observations to be taken to mean that any allegation of involuntariness at an appeal must be doomed to failure just because the Defence had claimed that the statements were voluntary at the trial below. Trial judges must remain, at all times, vigilant to the likelihood of controversies of this nature and therefore ought to ensure that statements sought to be admitted in evidence by the Prosecution are indeed given voluntarily without threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression or coercion. In this, they should constantly bear in mind the principles enunciated in 
Ajodha v The State
 
[1982] AC 204
.
The viability of the defences
Failure of the trial judge to give due consideration to the appellant’s conspiracy theory and the attempted extortion
53        It is clear from the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision that he had given due consideration to both segments of the defences raised by the appellant. As to the alleged conspiracy, having evaluated the evidence of the two victims and P3, the trial judge arrived at the conclusion that there was no probability of any conspiracy against the appellant. Further, he noted that the appellant had failed to make known this defence in his statements to the police. In respect of the alleged extortion attempt, the trial judge considered the testimonies of the appellant’s mother and brother-in-law and decided to accord little weight to their evidence that P3 had attempted to extort money from them. He observed that there was nothing that suggested that the alleged extortion note, delivered months after the appellant’s offences had come to light, was remotely linked to the complaints made against the appellant by V1 and V2.
54        Having conducted a thorough analysis of all the evidence and circumstances surrounding the alleged defences, the trial judge was convinced that the defences were raised as a convenient afterthought. In light of the cogent justifications evident in the trial judge’s reasoning, there exists no basis for me to overturn the findings of the lower court.
Failure to properly consider the appellant’s medical condition
55        It was noted during the appellant’s first instance medical examination by Dr Pearllyn Quek that the appellant displayed signs of erectile dysfunction. However, subsequent tests performed by the same doctor confirmed unequivocally that the appellant was able to achieve a rigid erection. Counsel for the appellant submitted that more weight ought to have been given to the results of the first test as it was conducted closer in time to the alleged offences.
56        It should be noted, however, that Dr Quek, when cross-examined by the appellant’s then counsel, affirmed that “the time at which the [tests were] done does not matter because venous incompetence if present is not reversible” and that “the 2nd ultrasound [did] not show any evidence of venous incompetence and in fact precluded this diagnosis”. In light of the unwavering testimony from Dr Quek, the trial judge was justified in concluding that the appellant was not labouring under any medical condition that would render his commission of the alleged offences impossible.
Improper application of Tang Kin Seng and the excessive reliance on circumstantial evidence
57        The appellant submitted that there was no medical evidence to prove that he had indeed penetrated V1 during the alleged offence and that it was therefore unsafe and unsatisfactory for the Prosecution to rely on the “backdoor” of circumstantial evidence to circumvent the strict requirement to prove penetration. As to the alleged offences committed against V2, the appellant submitted that the photographs taken by P3 could not positively identify the person engaging in anal intercourse with V2. It was therefore asserted that “the defence need only raise a doubt, however feeble, in the prosecution’s case in order to have the conviction set aside”.
58        I find the appellant’s submission wholly unmeritorious. It has been established that a court is entitled to convict an accused on the sole basis of circumstantial evidence so long as all the evidence leads inevitably and inexorably to the accused’s guilt: 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
[1965–1968] SLR 67
 and 
PP v Oh Laye Koh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 385
.
 In any event, it is clear from the reasoning of the trial judge that while he did give weight to the circumstantial evidence, such as the photographs and lubricants recovered from the appellant’s residence and his room in his mother’s flat, the judge had premised his conviction of the accused primarily on the weight of the direct evidence of the two victims and the corroborative testimony of P3.
59        As for the judge’s reliance on the test in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
, I was of the view that the trial judge had correctly considered the evidence of both victims and supplemented any inadequacies in their testimony with the incontrovertible direct evidence of P3, as well as the other circumstantial evidence. At no point in his reasoning did the learned trial judge err in his application of the abovementioned test.
Conclusion
60        For all the reasons set out above, the appellant’s attempt to impugn the trial judge’s findings of fact had to be rejected. Consequently, the appellant’s appeal was dismissed and his conviction upheld. As this appeal arose only in respect of the appellant’s conviction, there was no reason to disturb the trial judge’s decision on sentence, especially in view of the fact that the lower court had duly considered the many aggravating factors present in this case.

Judgement reserved.
 
 
 
 
District Judge Kow Keng Siong:
The charges & the appeal
1.         This Judgement arises from an appeal against sentence.
2.         The Accused, Mr Mihaly Magashazie, pleaded guilty to the following 5 charges before me –
a.         theft of a Citibank Visa card in the possession of one Charles Corley William, an offence under section 379 of the Penal Code (DAC 56366/2004);
b.         using Charles Corley William’s stolen Citibank Visa card to pay for a gold chain and a gold pendant (valued at $6,190), an offence of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code (DAC 57067/2004);
c.         theft of a HSBC Visa card and a UOB Visa card in the possession of one Douglas Louden, an offence under section 379 of the Penal Code (DAC 57070/2004);
d.         using Douglas Louden’s stolen HSBC Visa card to pay for a Montblanc watch (valued at $4,190), an offence of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code (DAC 57073/2004); and
e.         using a National Visa card in the name of Andrew Harrison to pay for a gold chain (valued at $6,160), an offence of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code (DAC 57073/2004).
3.         At the time of the Accused’s guilty plea, he faced 12 other charges of theft, cheating and attempted cheating. He consented to having these charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
4.         After considering the circumstances of the case, I sentenced the Accused as follows –
a.         DAC 56366/2004 & DAC 57070/2004: 1 month’s imprisonment on each charge;
b.         DAC 57067/2004; DAC 57073/2004 & DAC 57081/2004: 1 year’s imprisonment on each charge;
c.         Sentences for DAC 56366/2004, DAC 57067/2004 & DAC 57073/2004 to run consecutively (total: 2 years and 1 month’s imprisonment), effective from 26 December 2004 (the date when the Accused was first remanded).
5.         I shall now set out the basis of my sentencing decision.
The facts
6.         The Accused is a Hungarian national. Between 21 December 2004 and 24 December 2004, he stole 4 credit cards from various hotels in Singapore by prying open lockers in the male changing room and gym room in these hotels with a bottle opener. The stolen credit cards consisted of –
a.         a Citibank Visa card belonging to Corley Charles William – stolen on 21 December 2004 (DAC 56366/2004);
b.         a HSBC Visa card and a UOB Visa card belonging to Douglas Louden – stolen on 22 December 2004 (DAC 57070/2004); and
c.         a National Visa card belonging to Andrew Harrison – stolen on 24 December 2004 (DAC 57080/2004: TIC charge).
After stealing the credit cards, the Accused used them to purchase various items (mostly gold jewelleries) amounting to a total of $23,105.
7.         Investigations revealed that after the Accused had used William’s credit card, he placed it in Louden’s wallet before stealing the latter’s (Louden) credit cards. Similarly, after using Louden’s credit card, the Accused placed it in Harrison’s wallet before stealing the latter’s (Harrison) credit card. The Accused did this to prevent his victims from discovering the theft of their credit cards early, so that he would have more time to fraudulently use their credit cards.
8.         Based on information received, CAD officers from the Financial Fraud Branch arrested the Accused on 24 December 2004 outside a jewellery shop – apparently after fraudulently using Harrison’s credit card to pay for 2 gold coins.
[1]
 
At the time of his arrest, the Accused had, inter alia, a bottle opener, Harrison’s National Visa card, as well as an assortment of jewelleries and a Montblanc watch (amounting to a total of $22,686). These items were seized from him.
Antecedent
9.         The Accused is not a first offender for property offence. In 1985, he was convicted in Singapore of theft in dwelling and was sentenced to 1 day’s imprisonment and $700 fine.
Mitigation plea
10.       Through his counsel, the Accused asked that a short custodial sentence be imposed in his case. Salient aspects of the Defence submissions in support of this plea are as follows –
a.         The Accused had shown his remorse by pleading guilty expeditiously and being co-operative throughout the investigations;
b.         He did not profit from the offences, but had in fact surrendered almost all of the fruits of his crimes on his arrest. Apart from a shirt (valued at $419), the rest of the cheated property had been restored to their rightful owners;
c.         The Accused has liver problems and is in poor health.
Sentencing considerations
Value of mitigating factors cited
11.       I am not impressed by the Accused’s mitigating plea. In my view, the factors cited did not merit any significant sentencing discount.
12.       In assessing sentence, I was mindful that the Accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage of the proceedings. It is an accepted principle of law that an accused is usually given a discount for pleading guilty. This is because by so doing, he has shown his remorse and has also saved the Court and Prosecution substantial time and expense: 
Lim Kim Seng v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 743
 
Sinniah Pillay v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 225
 @ page 231; 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
.
 However, it is also clear that the weight to be attached to a guilty plea must depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, including the element of public interest: 
Fu Foo Tong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 455
; 
Lim Hock Hin v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
; 
Tay Boon Sien v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 734
.
 In my view, the Accused had no choice but to plead guilty and co-operate with the authorities. After all, he was arrested outside a jewellery shop pursuant to information received by the authorities. At the material time, he had apparently just made a fraudulent purchase with Harrison’s credit card. Furthermore, the Accused was found in curious possession of another person’s credit card, a bottle opener, and an assortment of jewelleries of substantial value. The Accused must have realized soon after his arrest that it would be an uphill task explaining the suspicious circumstances that he was in.
13.       As for the fact that the Accused did not gain anything from his crime and that the victims suffered no loss, I found this to be purely fortuitous. It should be remembered that the Accused was arrested with the fruits of his crime and these were seized from his possession at the material time. In any event, the fact that an offender did not profit from his misdeed is a mitigating factor that generally carries very little weight: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
.
 This is because a contrary view (ie to recognise that non-profit from a crime is a mitigating factor) would be incompatible with the principle of deterrence and might even render the punishment of conduct crimes ineffective and inadequate.
14.       Finally, in regards to the Accused’s alleged weak disposition, I found that this was not sufficiently established at the proceedings. In any event, ill-health is not a mitigating factor except in the most exceptional cases when judicial mercy may be exercised: 
PP v Ong Ker Seng
 
[2001] 4 SLR 180
 @ para 30.
Aggravating factors
15.       On the other hand, I found that there were several aggravating factors in the circumstances of this case.
16.       Firstly, the Accused is not a mere opportunist who – after chancing upon unattended wallets left in public places – was momentarily tempted by greed to steal the credit cards and use them. He had in fact perpetrated his crime by entering into restricted hotel premises and breaking into secured lockers with a bottle opener to remove the credit cards – not just once, but three times. The Accused also had the presence of mind to delay detection of his misdeeds by substituting pilfered credit cards with those stolen from earlier victims. It is trite law that an act done after deliberation and with premeditation – as opposed to the situation where it is done on the spur of the moment and ‘in hot blood’ – is an aggravating circumstance: 
Ooi Joo Keong v PP
 
[1997] 2 SLR 68
.
 The rationale for this has been explained in 
Sentencing and Criminal Justice
 (3
rd
 edition @ page 136), where Andrew Ashworth stated that –
A person who plans or organises a crime is generally more culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender is therefore more fully confirmed in his anti-social motivation than someone who acts on impulse. … Planned lawbreaking constitutes a great threat to society, since it betokens a considered attack on social values, with greater commitment and perhaps continuity than a spontaneous crime.
17.       Secondly, I noted that the victims of the Accused’s theft charges are foreigners. Given their status, the adverse impact of the Accused’s offences on these persons – the tremendous inconvenience, anxiety and sense of vulnerability from losing an important financial instrument (such as one’s credit card) in a foreign land – must certainly have been magnified.
18.       Thirdly, the Accused had used the stolen credit cards to make numerous fraudulent purchases. Altogether, the Accused had committed 9 counts of cheating and 5 counts of attempted cheating with the stolen credit cards. The large number of offences committed would justify the imposition of longer custodial sentences.
19.       Finally, offences concerning the fraudulent use of credit cards have always been regarded more seriously. This is because they involve deception of financial institutions and business establishments and are easy to commit but difficult to detect. 
Sentencing precedents
20.       In cases where an offender is part of a sophisticated syndicate, capable of committing credit card fraud
 on a large scale and skilled at avoiding detection, substantial custodial sentences have generally been imposed. See for instance Ong Tiong Poh v PP 
[1998] 2 SLR 853
, where the appellant was convicted on two cheating charges under section 420 Penal Code and eight abetment by conspiracy of cheating charges under section 420 read with section 109, for using counterfeit credit cards. The appellant handed counterfeit credit cards to accomplices, gave instructions to purchase goods at various shops, received the purchased goods and paid commissions to the accomplices based on the selling price of the goods. On appeal, the appellant was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment for each charge – three of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively (total of 60 months’ imprisonment). A similar aggregate sentence of 60 months' imprisonment was also imposed in the case of 
Vasudevan A/L Thandavan v PP
 (Magistrate's Appeal 77 of 1996 - Unreported). Here the appellant had pleaded guilty to four cheating charges. The total value of the purchases made through a syndicated counterfeit credit card operation was $13,231.10.
21.       For non-syndicated credit card
 fraud cases, the tariff sentence has been at least one year's imprisonment on each charge. Thus, in 
Fadilah bte Omar v PP
 (Magistrate's Appeal 168 of 1996 - Unreported), the appellant was sentenced to a total of 14 months' imprisonment on pleading guilty to 3 cheating charges and one criminal misappropriation charge. Eleven charges under section 420 were taken into consideration. In this case, the appellant had used a credit card which she found in a toilet to make various purchases (amounting to $1,352.62). The appellant was a first offender and had made full restitution. The appellant’s sentence was affirmed on appeal.
Sentence imposed
22.       After careful consideration, I sentenced the Accused to 1 month’s imprisonment on each of the theft charge, and 1 year’s imprisonment on each of the cheating charge. Bearing in mind the one transaction rule and totality principle of sentencing, as well as the observations in 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 and 
Maideen Pillai bin P N Mohamed Shah v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
, I ordered 3 of the sentences (2 for cheating and one for theft) to run consecutively. The Accused will thus have to serve a total of 2 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.
23.       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentences, appealed on 11 February 2005 and is presently serving sentence.

District Judge Wong Keen Onn
The charges
1.         On 23 November 2004, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of corruptly obtaining a gratification by way of a loan of $600 whilst as the Managing Agent for the Management Corporation Strata Title of Balestier Point, from a representative of KH Hardware and Machinery (2001) Pte Ltd (“KH”), as an inducement to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, that is, to help the said KH secure the tender for a lift maintenance contract at Balestier Point, an offence under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (“PCA”). He was convicted of the charge (DAC 45752/04).
2.         The accused also consented to two other similar charges under s 6(a) PCA (DAC 45751/2004 & DAC 45753/2004) to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. In the first charge DAC 45751/2004, the accused corruptly obtained for himself a loan of $500 as gratification from the sole proprietor of Shun Aircon Services as an inducement to help Shun Aircon Services to secure the chiller repair project at Balestier Point.  In the third charge DAC 45753/2004, the accused corruptly obtained for himself a loan of $2000 as gratification from the sole proprietor of New Century Security Agency to recommend business opportunities to the latter.
The facts
3.         The facts revealed that the accused had corruptly obtained a loan of $600 from one Tan Eng Teck Tracy (“giver”) as a gratification as an inducement for recommending to his principal, MCST of Balestier Point, to engage Mr Tan’s company as the lift maintenance contractor. The Statement of Facts to which the accused had unreservedly admitted to is reproduced below:
“           The accused is Teng Cheow Hing, a Managing Agent for the Management Corporation Strata Title of Balestier Point (“MCST”). His duties included calling for quotations from suppliers, recommending suitable contractors and reporting against any misconduct by existing contractors of MCST.
2.         On or about 24 August 2004, the accused contacted one Tan Eng Teck Tracy (“Tan”), a Sales cum Marketing Manager of KH Hardware and Machinery (2001) Pte Ltd. The accused solicited for a loan of S$1,000 from Tan. When Tan declined, the accused told Tan that he could recommend to MCST to engage Tan’s company as the lift maintenance contractor. Tan then replied that he would check with his boss on the matter.
3.         On or about 25 August 2004, at Tan’s office at 170 Tyrwhitt Road, Singapore, Tan reduced the loan amount requested by the accused to S$600. The accused accepted this, and Tan handed a cheque for S$600 to the accused. This loan amount was meant as an inducement for the accused to help Tan’s company to secure the tender for the lift maintenance contract at Balestier Point.
4.         The accused has admitted that it was wrong of him to solicit, and to take the money from Tan with who he had official dealings with. His supervisor, Michaeal Arokia Selvan, has also indicated that the accused is prohibited from receiving monies from anyone with whom he had official dealings with. The accused was aware of this.”
Mitigation
4.         The accused, 42 years of age, is a first offender and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. Counsel for the accused submitted that the accused had obtained the gratification to meet the expenses of hiring a maid to take care of his family members. Accused informed the Court that his grandmother was bedridden due to a stroke and his father was suffering from cancer.   He had engaged a maid since 13 January 2003 to take care of his grandmother, thus incurring some S$7,595 in maid levy.  His family was and still is facing severe financial hardship. He is the sole breadwinner of the family.
5.         Counsel informed the Court that the accused had “approached the authorities to report on the activities that were the subject matter of these charges”.   He did not encash the S$600 cheque that was issued to him but claimed that he had “voluntarily returned it to the authorities”. The accused had also “repaid” all the other loan monies he had obtained. Counsel urged the Court not to impose a jail term as the accused would then not be able to support his family financially.
DPP’s address
6.         The Learned DPP did not submit on sentence. However, the DPP informed the Court that the cheque of $600 in the proceeded charge was not encashed but was given to the CPIB as an exhibit for the purpose of investigation. For the first charge DAC 45751/04 that was taken into consideration, the cheque of $500 was encashed by the accused but the accused subsequently “repaid” the sum of $500 to the giver sometime in November 2004, which was well after the accused had been charged in Court on 12 October 2004 for these offences. As for the gratification of $2000 in the third charge DAC 45753/04 (that was taken into consideration), it was paid out to the accused in the form of cash of $1000 and a cheque of $1,000. The cheque of $1,000 was handed to the authorities during investigations. The other sum of $1000 was repaid to the giver by the accused in November 2004. On the accused’s claim that “he had voluntarily surrendered the $600 cheque”, the DPP clarified that the accused had gone to CPIB on 25 August 2004 to lodge a complaint stating that the giver was trying to bribe him. The accused then gave that cheque to the CPIB. As mentioned above, the other cheque of $1,000 in the third charge was also seized from the accused on the same day.
Reasons for the sentence imposed
7.         In assessing sentence, I took into account the accused’s plea of guilt at the first opportunity, his subsequent co-operation with the CPIB and that he was a first offender. These were mitigating factors in favour of the accused as they go to demonstrate signs of remorse on the part of the accused. However, counsel conceded during mitigation that the investigations had revealed sufficient evidence against his client as the accused had made admissions to the CPIB.  In addition, the accused did deposit into his account one of the cheques (the subject matter in the first charge DAC 45751/04) that he had corruptly obtained before returning the loan to the giver of the bribe. This suggested that he did have the required mens rea for the offence under section 6(a) PCA. Thus, the evidence against the accused was quite strong such that the discount for a plea of guilt will have to be less: see 
Wong Kai Chuen v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
. In addition, it is trite law that an offender’s plea of guilt has to be balanced against other considerations, such as the dominant public interest of general deterrence: see 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
.  It is without doubt that corruption offences are serious offences and the fundamental sentencing principle in such cases is general deterrence:
 
Ong Beng Leong v PP
 
[2005] SGHC 22
,
 
Chua Tiong Tiong v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 425
, 
LimTeck Chye v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 525
.
  Notwithstanding
 
this, I gave some weight to his plea of guilt and the fact that he had a prior clean record.
8.        
 
As for the accused’s submission that
 
he
 
committed the crime out of the
 
financial hardship that his family was facing, it is trite law that this is not a valid mitigating factor that will lead to a discount in the sentence as no very exceptional or extreme circumstance had been  brought to the court’s attention: see 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
. Similarly, the fact that the accused returned the loan of $1,500 to the two givers of the bribe should also not be regarded as a strong mitigating factor. Firstly, the Prevention of Corruption Act makes it clear the both the giver and recipient of the bribe would be committing offences under the said Act (except in the case of an entrapment).  Both the giver and the receiver are equally culpable in a corruption offence: see 
LimTeck Chye v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 525
.
 
  Hence, little credit ought to be given to a receiver if he returns the gratification to the giver as the whole transaction is, in the first place, illegal in law. Instead, the proper position is that if the receiver does not surrender the gratification to the authorities, that would be regarded an aggravating factor in sentencing . I therefore gave little weight to these two submissions by his counsel.
9.         On the other hand, there are aggravating features present in this case. First, I note that the accused was employed as the managing agent for the Management Council of MCST of Balestier Point. He was in an influential position in the invitation of contractors for quotations and award of the tenders for contracts for works in the condominium. He had abused his position in committing this offence. Second, the accused was more culpable as he himself had solicited the bribe. Third, instead of owning up, he had initially casted aspersions on the givers of the gratification by maliciously alleging that he was offered bribes instead, thus suggesting his own innocence. The two cheques amounting to $600 and $1,000 respectively were given to CPIB in order to substantiate his false claims. In my view, the handing over of the cheques to CPIB could not be regarded in the same category as restitution as it was specifically done to buttress the accused’s malicious allegations. That would hardly be regarded as an indication of true remorse on the part of the accused. Fourth, the accused had used the gratification for his own use up till the time he was charged in court. Fifth, I was mindful that there were two similar offences that were taken into consideration and this would justify the imposition of a heavier sentence than would otherwise be imposed for the single offence that the accused had pleaded guilty to: see 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
 at 142E. Having considered all the circumstances, including the fact this was a case of corruption involved in a commercial context, I was of the view that a stiff fine was appropriate. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $8,000 in default 2 months’ imprisonment. 
Scope of section 13 PCA and the imposition of a penalty
10.       I now turn to the issue of whether, on the facts of this case, a penalty under section 13 PCA ought to be imposed with respect to each of the three charges. The total gratification of $3,100 in the three charges comprised loans as follows: a cheque of $600 in the second charge (proceeded charge); a cheque of $500 in the first charge (that was encashed); and a cheque of $1000 (not encashed) and cash of $1,000.  It was not in dispute that these loans had either been returned to the giver of the bribe or had been handed to the investigating officer well before the date of conviction in these proceedings. Given this factual matrix, the Court invited parties to address on whether a penalty ought to be imposed in respect of each of the 3 charges. As both the Learned DPP and defence counsel indicated that they were not prepared on that day to fully address the Court on the issue, the matter was adjourned for parties to make submissions to the Court.
Defence’s submissions
11.       Defence Counsel at first
[i]
 alluded to the contrasting language used on section 13(1) PCA (which deals with charges which a defendant is convicted on) as opposed to the section 13(2) PCA (which deals with charges which are taken into consideration). According to counsel, the object of section 13 was “primarily to prevent corrupt wrongdoers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of their crimes:” see 
Tan Kwang Joo v PP
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 26
.
 It would go counter to the object of section 13 if defendants were required to pay up a sum for which they had either not taken or had paid back before conviction. In other words, if defendants would be required to pay the gratification as a penalty even if they had repaid it already, then it would certainly be better for them to hold on to the gratification and not pay it back. Yet, the object of section 13 was “primarily to prevent corrupt wrongdoers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of the crimes.” Thus, counsel submitted that in order to encourage defendants to pay back the gratification, no penalty ought to be imposed by the Court on all the three charges.
12.       In his further submission dated 6 January 2005, after the Court had referred parties to four Malaysian authorities
[ii]
 on a similar provision in the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act and two local unreported decisions, counsel urged the Court not to follow the Malaysian authorities. Counsel submitted that the Malaysian decisions were unhelpful even though they dealt with a similar provision as the Malaysian decisions had only quoted other Malaysian decisions and also none of the Singapore decisions had cited any Malaysian decisions. Counsel surmised that that there were differences in the judicial approaches in the Singapore and Malaysia. Counsel then contended that section 13(1) PCA “should not be read literally”.  A distinction ought be made where the loan monies were not taken at all, as opposed to where it had been taken. Citing 
PP v Suen Kok Weng
  (CR 6/99) and 
Tan See Meng v PP
 (MA 62/2001/01, unreported) , counsel submitted that section 13 PCA does not apply where a cheque has not been encashed as no money (“gratification”) was “accepted” or “received” within the meaning of those sections. This was because the cheque had not been converted to cash. Also in this case, the defendant had either not taken or have repaid all the loan monies. Hence, defence counsel submitted that no penalty should be imposed on the defendant in respect of the second charge that he was convicted upon. As for the gratification in the first and third charges that were taken into consideration, it was submitted that the Defendant had not kept the loan nor benefited from the loan and it would be manifestly unfair to impose any penalty.
DPP’s further submissions
13.       The prosecution made two sets of submissions. In the first submission
[iii]
 at the hearing on 23 December 2004, the learned DPPs
[iv]
 highlighted that section 13(1) and section 13(2) PCA had used the words “shall” and “may” respectively. It would thus appear that a plain reading of the wording of section 13(1) and section 13(2) suggests that it is mandatory for the court to impose a penalty of $600 on the accused in respect of the amount of gratification in proceeded charge DAC 4572/2004, while it is entirely within the court’s discretion to decide whether or not to increase this penalty further by including the sum of $2,500 that being the total amount of gratification in the two other charges taken into consideration.
14.       Notwithstanding this, the DPP
2
 
referred to Parliament’s intention in ascertaining the scope of section PCA by looking at its legislative history. The DPPs
2
 
pointed out that the present section 13 PCA was first implemented as clause 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960. The object of the legislation was “to provide for the more effective prevention of corruption by remedying various weaknesses and defects” which experience had revealed in the existing corruption laws. It appeared that Clause 13 had only envisaged the imposition of a penalty where the accused had been convicted of an offence of accepting an illegal gratification and this was evident from the words “
found guilty
” in that clause. In dealing with the operative word “
acceptance
” in section 13 PCA, the learned DPP then referred to three sentencing precedents to show that the local courts are only inclined to order a penalty where the accused has actually received the gratification as cash in hand and that once an accused has done so, it is immaterial that he did not use the full sum of the gratification for his own benefit.
15.       The first case cited was 
PP v Lim Teng Hoo Danny
 (MA 211/91/01), a case that dealt with section 13(2) PCA to illustrate that it was mandatory to impose a penalty for gratification obtained in cash for the charges taken into consideration where there was no evidence to suggest that the offender had returned the gratification. The DPP cited the second case of 
Tan Kwang Joo v PP
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 26
 for the principle that a penalty ought not to be imposed under section 13(1) PCA if it was not in dispute that the appellant personally did not receive the said bribe of $226,027.41 (which was in the form of a tiling work sub-contract valued at $226,027.41 awarded to a company of his brother-in-law), or any part of it.  According to the prosecution, the case of 
Tang See Meng v PP
 (MA 62/2001/01, unreported) showed that the Courts are only inclined to order a penalty where the accused had actually received the gratification as cash in hand and that once an accused had done so, it was immaterial that he did not used the full sum of the gratification for his own benefit. In that case, the gratifications were given in the form of cheques which the offender encashed at the bank.
16.       Turning to the present case, the prosecution initially contended that while the total gratification received by the accused in respect of all 3 charges was $3,100, the actual amount which the accused received as cash in hand was $1,500 as the accused did not encash the two cheques of $600 and $1,000. The accused had further made full restitution of the $500 and $1,000 he obtained from Tan Kian Hin (Tan) and Chong Say Mee (Chong) respectively and both Tan and Chong have confirmed that the cheques issued to them by the accused had been cleared. The DPP then submitted that it was within the court’s discretion to order the accused to pay the penalty of $3,100 since this was in fact the total amount of gratification which was at the disposal of the accused. However, in view of the fact that the accused did not encash the cheques for $600 and $1000 respectively, the DPP contended that a penalty of $1,500, which the accused actually received as cash in hand and used for his own or his family’s benefit, was sufficient in the circumstances. Although the accused has made “restitution” of $1,500, that fact was immaterial in these circumstances and should only be considered in deciding the appropriate sentence to be meted out to him and not in determining whether or not a penalty under section 13 should be ordered in respect of this sum.
17.       The Court then brought to the parties’ attention, the cases of 
Lee Mun Foong v PP
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 16
, 
PP v Lai Sien Kon
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 110
, 
Poh Cho Ching v PP
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 186
 and 
Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris v PP
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 155
 as both parties did not refer to these decisions at all. Parties were also referred to the cases of 
PP v Myo Min Zaw
 (DAC 47926-36/2004, unreported, sentenced on 23.12.2004) and 
PP v Mohamed Gani Bin A Othman Shah
 (DAC 388-398/2005, unreported, sentenced on 26.1.2005) where the Courts agreed with the DPP’s submissions not to impose the full penalty as the gratifications in those cases were either recovered from the offender or there was a finding that the gratification was shared between co-accused.
18.       Faced with these authorities, the Learned DPP
[v]
 
 
 sought further directions and then tendered a further submission (
Exhibit E3
). The prosecution then stated that it would like to “re-clarify” its position and then urged the Court to follow the Malaysian case of 
Lee Mun Foong v PP
 instead by imposing a penalty regardless of whether the gratification is recovered or not. She then submitted that the Court should impose the full penalty of $600 for the proceeded charge whereas for the two charges taken into consideration, the Court had a discretion to impose a penalty up to $2500. However, the DPP declined to comment on the two cases of 
PP v Myo Min Zaw
 and 
PP v Mohamed Gani Bin A. Othman Shah
.
Decision of the Court
19.       Section 13, Prevention Of Corruption Act reads as follow:
(1) Where a court convicts any person of an offence committed by the 
acceptance of any gratification
 in contravention of any provision of this Act, then, if that gratification is a sum of money or if the value of 
that
 gratification can be assessed, the court 
shall
, 
in addition to
 imposing on that person any other punishment, order him to pay as a penalty, within such time as may be specified in the order, a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification or is, in the opinion of the court, the value of that gratification, and 
any such penalty shall be recoverable as a fine
.
(2) Where a person charged with two or more offences for the acceptance of gratification in contravention of this Act is convicted of one or some of those offences, and the other 
outstanding offences are taken into consideration by the court under section 178 of the Criminal Procedure Code
 for the purpose of passing sentence, the court 
may
 increase the penalty mentioned in subsection (1) by an amount 
not exceeding
 the total amount or value of the gratification specified in the charges for the offences so taken into consideration. (emphasis added)
20.       In interpreting statutes, s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act makes it imperative that the court adopts a purposive construction of a provision, and not merely a literal interpretation: see 
Nicholas Kenneth v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 80
.
 This approach is derived from the case of 
Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995
 
[1995] 2 SLR 201
 in which the Court of Appeal said:
“It is well established and not disputed by either parties that a purposive interpretation should be adopted … to give effect to the intent and will of Parliament.  The principle to be applied is that the words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament: EA Driedger, 
Construction of Statutes
(2nd Ed, 1983) p 87.  The intention is to be found at the time the law was enacted or in some circumstances when it subsequently reaffirms the particular statutory provision.  This is also evident from s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) …”
21.       Furthermore, the High Court also recognised that in construing statutes, the purposive and literal interpretation of a statutory provision may often coincide, but that is not always the case. Where they conflict, it is settled law that a purposive interpretation should be adopted over a literal interpretation that does not support the purpose and object of the written law, even if the wording of the statute is not ambiguous or inconsistent: 
Comfort Management Pte Ltd v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 16
, 
Nicholas Kenneth v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 80
, 
Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995
 and S 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1).
22.      
 
With these principles in mind, I turn to the construction of section 13(1) PCA. A literal reading of the subsection with the phrase “
Courts shall ... order… penalty
” would suggest that as long as an offender accepts a gratification and is subsequently convicted of an offence under section 5(a) or section 6(a) of the Act, a penalty of that amount must be imposed in any case regardless of the circumstances including even if he surrenders the same amount to the authorities or that the gratification was immediately seized from him in the case of an entrapment.
 
Indeed, this is the position taken in some Malaysian cases:
 
Mohamed Bin Long v PP
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 76
; 
Lee Mun Foong v PP
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 16
, 18; 
PP v Lai Sien Kon
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 110
, 
Poh Cho Ching v PP
 
[1983] 1 MLJ 86
, 
Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris v PP
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 155
, 
PP v Chan Kit Tong Sally
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 358
 and 
Jazuli Bin Mohan v PP
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 190
.
23.       In 
Lee Mun Foong v PP
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 16
, the appellant had been convicted under section 4(a) of the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act, 1961. The gratification of $1,000 had been handed to and accepted by the appellant in the course of a trap set by the Anti-Corruption Agency officers and the money was recovered upon the appellant’s arrest. On appeal, an additional penalty of $1,000 was imposed on the appellant. The judge then reserved the following question for the Federal Court – ""Whether the provisions of s 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1961, (which is similar to our provision) are applicable in every case of a conviction under the said Act or whether the application of s 13 is restricted only to instances where the money the subject-matter of the offence has not been recovered.""   The Malaysian Federal Court held that there was no ambiguity in the wording of that section and adopted a literal reading of the provision. The Federal Court agreed with the trial judge that the mandatory penalty under s 13 of the Act must be imposed regardless of whether the gratification given was recovered or not.
24.       However, with due respect, such a literal reading of the subsection will give rise to difficulties and lead to absurdity and an unjust outcome. This can be illustrated by 3 scenarios. Take for instance the first scenario where the offender is convicted of corruptly receiving a chattel valued at $Y as gratification under the Act. The chattel has either been recovered from or surrendered by the offender to the authorities prior to the date of the conviction. A literal approach would require the Court to impose a penalty equal to the value of the chattel, namely $Y: see s 13(1) PCA. In addition, the chattel will be forfeited as it was the subject-matter of or was used in the commission of an offence. Here, the offender will have to pay a fine of $Y even though the gratification (chattel) has been disgorged from him. Take the second scenario where the offender is convicted of corruptly accepting cash of $Y. The gratification was either seized from him or was surrendered to the authorities. Applying a mandatory approach regardless of the circumstances, a penalty of $Y will have to be imposed on the offender. The seized cash of $Y will also be forfeited as it is proceeds of the crime. Again, the offender has to pay a fine of $Y even though the proceeds of the crime ($Y) has been disgorged from him. In the third scenario, the gratification accepted by the offender is $Y in cash. This was not recovered from him. Here the Court would impose a penalty of $Y and that offender would only be out of pocket for this sum, which is less than the case for the other two scenarios.  A comparison of these three situations reveals that a literal reading would result in a glaring disparity: those who either received non-monetary gratification or surrendered the bribes prior to conviction would be worse off that those who held on to their gratification. It is akin to treating section 13 PCA as an additional punishment provision for the same offence. In my opinion, this approach leads to absurdity and could not have been intended by the draftsman. A literal approach will also create greater obstacles to authorities in investigating such crimes by discouraging guilty offenders from surrendering the ill-gotten proceeds of their crime, which will be contrary to public policy.
25.       On the other hand, it is clear that the purpose and object of section 13 PCA is to eliminate the ability of offenders to benefit from their corrupt activities by disgorging the bribes from the culprit who accepted it. That will act a strong deterrent to potential offenders. This is evident from the Second Reading of the Prevention of Corruption Bill 1960 on 13 February 1960. The Minister for Home Affairs said at column 380:
“Clause 13 [now section 13 PCA] empowers a Court to order a person found guilty of accepting an illegal gratification to pay a penalty equal to the amount of that gratification in addition to any other punishment imposed, and such penalty shall be recoverable as a fine. This will act as a deterrent because, in addition to the penalty for the offence, the culprit is called upon to pay the amount he had taken as a bribe.”
26.       Indeed, this purpose was so held by our High Court in
 
Tan Kwang Joo v PP
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 26
.
 In that case, the appellant was convicted under section 6(a) Prevention of Corruption Act for having corruptly obtained a gratification, namely, a tiling work subcontract valued at $226,027.41 for his brother-in-law’s company as an inducement for the corrupt act. The Court imposed a penalty of $226,027.41. On appeal, the High Court set aside the penalty order and held that the purpose of section 13 PCA is to prevent corrupt wrongdoers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of their crime. The Court said at pg 27:
“
On the matter of the penalty I am at variance with the learned trial judge's views on the said section. In my view the section unequivocally and clearly concerns itself only with the situation 'where a court convicts any person of an offence committed by the acceptance of any gratification in contravention of any provision of this Act'. Here the appellant was convicted of obtaining a gratification for Star-Tile General Contractor. It is not in dispute that the appellant personally did not receive the said sum of $226,027.41 or any part of it. 
This section in my view was intended to prevent corrupt wrong-doers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of their crimes. I cannot imagine that the legislature ever intended that in similar circumstances such as these, a convicted accused had to be called upon to pay a penalty in respect of a sum which he himself clearly did not receive, accept or obtain for himself
… (italics mine) ”
27.       By virtue of section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, it is imperative that the Courts adopt a purposive construction of section 13 PCA over the literal interpretation of the section, which will does not promote the objects of the subsection as the latter will lead to gross injustice, especially where the gratification involved is substantial. In my opinion, adopting a purposive and reasonable approach to statutory interpretation, it is mandatory to impose a penalty equivalent to that part or whole of the gratification that is accepted by the convicted offender which the offender is, at the time of the conviction, accountable for the gratification. If, at that time, the gratification has been surrendered to (or seized by) the authorities, the offender would no longer be “accountable” for the gratification as the surrender or seizure of the gratification is effectively an act that disgorges an offender of his ill-gotten fruits of crime. In such a situation, the Court need not imposed a penalty but merely orders the gratification to be either forfeited or returned to the innocent giver, as the case may be: see 
PP v Suen Kok Weng
 (CR 6/99). That would be consistent with the provision’s underlying aim in deterring corruption as it prevents corrupt wrong-doers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of their crime.
28.       This purposive construction of section 13 PCA is, in my view, consistent with logic and the intention of the Parliament. This interpretation is also supported by the various decision in our Courts. In 
Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 281
, the appellant was convicted with corruptly accepting a loan of $2,000 for himself as an inducement under section 6(a) Prevention of Corruption Act. By the time of sentencing, he had repaid $300 of the loan. The appellant was ordered to pay a penalty of $1,700 only: see judgment at paras 2, 7, 10, 11, 13 and 47. On appeal, the High Court did not question the appropriateness of this penalty order. In 
PP v Subramaniam s/o Muneyandi
 
[2003] SGDC 259
, the accused was convicted on 2 charges of having corruptly obtained for himself loans amounting to a total of $50,000 as an inducement under section 6(a) PCA. The accused was ordered to pay $40,000 as penalty only. In ordering a penalty of $40,000, the district judge took into account the fact that the accused had already repaid $10,000 out of the $50,000 gratification: judgment at para 168. No appeal has been filed against the order in that case.
29.       In 
PP v Myo Min Zaw
 (DAC 47926-36/2004, sentenced on 22 December 2004), the offender was convicted of 4 charges under s 6(a) PCA for engaging with one Mohamed Gani Bin A Othman Shah in a conspiracy to accept bribes amounting a total of $4600 as commission as a reward for covering up the non-delivering of goods by a supplier to his employer SEC Pte Ltd. Another 7 similar charges were withdrawn by the Prosecution upon the offender’s conviction. The offender was sentenced to a total of 10 weeks’ imprisonment. The prosecution
[vi]
 
submitted that no penalty be imposed as offender had made restitution of the same amount of $4600 to the Company. The Court agreed and did not impose a penalty under section 13 PCA. There has been no appeal against the Court’s decision.
30.       In the related case of 
PP v Mohamed Gani Bin A Othman Shah
, the offender was convicted of 3 charges under s 6(a) PCA for conspiring with Myo Min Zaw (Myo) to corruptly accept a total gratification of $3,725. Another eight similar corruption charges involving a gratification of $9,527.30 were taken into consideration. The prosecution
[vii]
 
confirmed that the total gratification of $13,252.50 was shared between the offender Mohamed Gani and one Myo, and the offender had only received a total of $6,627 as his share. This comprises $1,869 in the three proceeded charges and $4,758 for the eight charges taken into consideration. This fact was stated clearly in the Statement of Facts. The learned DPP then urged the Court to impose a penalty of $6,627 being the actual amount of gratification the offender had received. The Court agreed with the prosecution and ordered a penalty of that sum.
31.      
 
In 
PP v Suen Kok Weng
 (CR 6/99), a case involving entrapment, the offender subsequently pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly obtaining $2,481. One other charge of corruptly obtaining $2,000 and a charge of criminal beach of trust were taken into consideration. He received 10 month’s imprisonment in total. The District Judge also ordered a penalty of $4,481 to be paid and directed that the $2,000 seized from that person be used to pay part of the penalty. The prosecution filed a criminal revision against the order. In that case, the complainant was instructed by the CPIB to make the offer of $2,000 bribe to entrap the offender who had solicited a bribe. The clear understanding was that the money would be recovered from the offender and returned to the complainant. The High Court revised the order and reduced the penalty to $2,481 (the gratification in the two proceeded charges that was not recovered). The $2,000 seized from the accused was returned to the complainant’s wife. This case is authority for the proposition that where gratification has been recovered from an offender such as through seizure by the authorities, the objective of disgorging the gratification for the offender has been attained and it is not necessary to invoke section 13 PCA to order a penalty of that amount. Although this is a case on section 13(2) PCA, I find the reasoning quite compelling and equally applicable to section 13(1) PCA as section 13(2) PCA was specifically enacted to extend similar powers in section 13(1) PCA on the Courts to impose a penalty equal to the amount or value of the gratification specified in the outstanding charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence: see the Minister for Law’s speech of the Second Reading of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill on 22 December 1981 at columns 319 and 333.
32.       There is also the case of 
Tang See Meng v PP
 (MA/62/2001/01) which stands for the proposition that where it has been shown that the offender had accepted the gratification, a penalty has to be imposed irrespective of whether or not he had personally and directly benefited from the full sum of the gratification. In that case, the offender was convicted after a trial on 5 charges under section 6(a) PCA involving $140,000 in cheques which had been encashed. Upon conviction, the offender urged the Court to impose a penalty of $70,000 as he claimed he had in reality pocketed only half of the money from each cheque. The prosecution disputed this. The court rejected counsel’s submission and ordered the offender to pay the full penalty of $140,000 (in default 4 months’ imprisonment) on the grounds that for the purposes of an order under Section 13, it was sufficient that the accused had taken receipt of the money cashed out on each cheque. It did not matter what the offender did with the gratification he had received. This decision is not inconsistent with the other local cases and the purposive construction of section 13 PCA stated earlier. It ought to be noted that 
Tang See Meng’s
 case dealt with the situation where the offender received the full gratification and did not surrender any part of it to the authorities.
33.       With regard to the Malaysian authorities, it is pertinent to note that they are not binding on our Courts in Singapore. Secondly, with due respect, the Malaysian Federal Court adopted the literal reading of the operative word “shall” in the Malaysian statutory provision. However, our courts are bound by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act to apply a purposive approach in statutory interpretation. Hence, the Singapore Courts have taken a different approach and have held that the object of our section 13 PCA was to prevent corrupt wrongdoers from keeping or benefiting from the spoils of their crime: 
Tan Kwang Joo v PP
 (supra). Our Courts do not view a penalty order as a punitive measure, unlike those in the Malaysian authorities. This difference in judicial approach is evident in the case of 
Choy Hon Tim v PP
 (MA 378/1995, unreported). In that case, it was held that the sentencer should first impose the sentence indicated by normal principles and then consider the question of deprivation of profit. The learned Senior District Judge discussed the issue of whether a Court should as a matter of discretion impose a lesser sentence merely because the offender is liable to pay a penalty pursuant to section 13 Prevention of Corruption Act and said:
“The more significant question was really whether the Court should as a matter of discretion or as a sentencing principle impose a lesser sentence. This appeared to be the Malaysian position. This was the view of the Malacca High Court in the 
Jazzuli bin Mohsin
 (1990) 2 MLJ 190, a corruption case, where at page 192 the Court said:
… It would appear that in imposing the sentence of eight months, the learned sessions court judge did not take into consideration the additional punishment required under s 13 (which corresponds with our section 13 Prevention of Corruption Act). Had she been otherwise informed about that punishment, I am sure she could have considered the combined punishment as a whole and imposed a lesser sentence.”
The Malacca High Court did not give any reasons for the above proposition.
The Court however preferred the views by 
Andrew Ashworth in Sentencing and Penal Policy
 1983 Ed at page 294 and adopted them in the instant case:
“In principle, the exercise of depriving an offender of the profits of his illegal activities is distinct from and additional to the task of sentencing him for his crimes: 
the sentencer should first impose the sentence indicated by normal principles
, and then consider the questions of deprivation of profits.... (emphasis added)
The same author in 
Sentencing and Criminal Justice
 
1992
 Ed at page 73 puts it this way on the same issue:
It is misleading to say that the order for confiscation adds to the offender's burden, because 
the burden should not begin to be weighed until the status quo is restored.
... 
What should be avoided, in all instances, is a disparity of result which means that an offender who can readily discharge obligations under the confiscation order receives a lower sentence – especially a lower prison sentence – than one who cannot. There is a long standing principle that a wealthy offender should not be allowed to ''buy away out prison''. (emphasis added)
34.       For the foregoing reasons, I decline to follow the Malaysian authorities. As stated earlier, the legislative scheme of section 13 PCA, as I see it, is not to penalise the offender twice over, that is, to make him out of pocket of another sum equal to the gratification when the gratification has already been disgorged from him either by the seizure by the authorities or the offender voluntarily having surrendered it to the authorities.
35.       Counsel had argued that his client had not “received” the gratification in the form of money as his client had not cashed out the cheque. If that was correct, it would be an indirect attack on the conviction of the accused under section 6(a) PCA as this is tantamount to arguing that the accused did not obtain the gratification as stated in the charge. This line of reasoning can be disposed of quickly. First, for section 13(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act to operate, the accused must be found guilty of “acceptance of any gratification in contravention of any provision of this Act”. The ordinary grammatical meaning of “accept” is to “to take or receive with consenting mind; receive with favour or approval”, “physically receive or accommodate, absorb an inanimate object: see 
New Oxford Shorter English Dictionary, Thumb Index Edition
.   This is similar in meaning to the word “obtain” used in sections 5 and 6 PCA as the ordinary grammatical meaning of obtain is “come into possession or enjoyment of; secure or gain as the result of request or effort; acquire, get”: see 
New Oxford Shorter English Dictionary
. Section 13 PCA is intricately linked to sections 5 and 6 in the same Act in that there must first be a contravention of the provisions in the Prevention of Corruption Act before section 13 can apply. Thus, it makes logical sense to ascribe a similar meaning to both “accept” and “obtain”.   Once it is proved that the accused has obtained a gratification for himself under either sections 5 or 6 PCA, it must follow that the accused would be regarded as having accepted the gratification under the provisions of section 13.
36.       Second, the word “gratification” has been given a wide meaning under section 2 PCA and is not restricted to merely money in the form of cash. As defined in s 2 PCA, it includes “money or any gift, loan, fee, reward, commission, valuable security or any other property or interest in property of any description whether moveable or immovable …”. Obviously, a valid cheque is a valuable security as it is a bill of exchange. It is a negotiable instrument and can be indorsed to another person and is equivalent to cash of the same value as stated on the cheque. Hence, once a receiver received a valid cheque in contravention of section 5 or 6 PCA, he would be regarded in law as having accepted the gratification under section 13 PCA.
37.       Turning to the facts of the present case, it is not in dispute that the three cheques amounting to $600, $500 and $1,000 that were received by the accused were valid bills of exchange. Two of the cheques amounting $600 and $1,000 were not encashed but were seized by the authorities. Applying the purposive interpretation in section 13 PCA, it would not be appropriate to impose a penalty as the ill-gotten gains have already been disgorged from the accused. As for the other gratification of $1,500 (cheque of $500 and cash of $1,000), the accused had used them for his own benefit. Being loans from the giver, he had returned $1,500 to them. However, that cannot be regarded as restitution. As mentioned earlier, as this is not a case of entrapment in the manner similar to 
PP v Suen Kok Weng
, the givers are equally culpable in the corruption offences: 
Lim
 
Teck Chye v PP
 (supra). The givers are, in law, not legally entitled to claim the loan monies as they are the subject matter of the corruption offence and also regarded as the proceeds of the crime. The act of the accused in returning the loan monies to the givers cannot be regarded as restitution to the person who is legally entitled to possession of the monies. On the factual matrix of this case, the accused had, in subsequently handing back to the giver a sum of money equal to part of the value of the gratification obtained, also applied the gratification for his own purposes. Applying the proposition in 
Tang See Meng v PP
, it would be necessary to impose the penalty of $1,500 as the accused is still “accountable” for that part of gratification.
38.       Hence, this Court declines to order a penalty for the gratification in the proceeded charge as the undisputed facts showed that the gratification in that charge has been disgorged from the accused. As for the corruption charges taken into consideration, the Court, applying section 13 PCA, imposes on the accused a penalty of $1,500 (in default three weeks’ imprisonment) being the value of gratification that the accused had received and had to be accountable for. In summary, the accused is fined $8,000 in default two months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $1,500 in default three weeks’ imprisonment.  I also order the seized cheques of $600 and $1,000 to be forfeited to the CPIB for disposal.

Antecedents
5.         The accused has 2 previous convictions of unauthorised possession of controlled drugs under section 8(a) Misuse of Drugs on 22.12.1993 and 13.05.1998 for which he was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment and 2 years’ imprisonment respectively. In addition, he was admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre on two occasions on 28.8.1995 and 4.6.1997 for unauthorised consumption of controlled drugs.
Mitigation and Submission on Sentence
6.         The accused is 28 years old and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He apologized for committing these offences and urged the Court to backdate the sentence to his date of remand.
7.         The DPP did not address on sentence but tendered in statistics on cases of theft from vehicles involving cash cards 
(Exhibit D)
. 
Reasons for the Sentence Imposed
8.         It is trite law that the first and foremost consideration in the balancing process in sentencing is the question of public interest: see 
Sim Gek Yong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 537
 and 
PP v Tan Fook
 Sum [1992] 2 SLR at 533. Where offences are rife, it is in the public interest for the Courts to increase the punishment for such offences so as to deter other like-minded persons from committing similar crimes. Not only is this consistent with the philosophy in our criminal justice model of protecting the public, it is
 
also in line with an established sentencing principle that prevalence of an offence is a valid sentencing consideration; see 
PP v Rajandran
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 260
, 
R v Cunningham
 (1993) 14 Cr. App. R. (S) 444 CA.  The learned DPP informed the Court that there were 757 reported cases of theft from motor vehicles involving cash cards.   This was some 12 per cent higher than the corresponding figures for the years of 2003 and 2002.  This is tabulated below:

9.         It is pertinent to bear in mind that these figures form only part of the category of offences involving theft from vehicles as the statistics are only confined to stolen cash cards from vehicles. It is clear that such offences remained prevalent. It is therefore in the public interest that deterrent sentences be imposed in such cases.
10.       Besides this, there are other aggravating features in this case. First, the offences of theft from motor vehicles are regarded as more serious in nature than other cases of theft simpliciter: see
 
PP v Muhammad Nazar bin Saari & ors
 
(DAC 19135/98
,
 sentenced on 29 September 1998, unreported). In that case, the Court had stated that the sentencing tariff for theft from a motor vehicle was between six to nine months’ imprisonment per charge in ordinary circumstances. The Court said:
“In addition to prevalence of an offence being a valid sentencing consideration, the nature of the offence is another legitimate consideration to determine the proper sentence. In the view of the Court, theft from a motor vehicle should be treated differently from other petty thefts. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor is right that although the Penal Code distinguishes between theft simpliciter and other forms of theft, such as theft in a dwelling place or theft and theft from a motor vehicle, no legislative distinction is made between simple theft and theft from a motor vehicle. It is the presence or absence of particular factors which will indicate the gravity of the instant offence. Generally theft from a motor vehicle is a graver offence than shoplifting for example.
In this regard, the Court adopts for this case the views of the court in the Malaysian case of 
PP v Wong Chak Heng
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 457
.
 In that case, the 23 year-old accused with no previous convictions faced 2 charges for simple theft of spare tyres together with rims from a Datsun 120Y and a Ford Laser. In the Magistrate's Court, the accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of RM $200 and RM$300 respectively for each charge. On an appeal against sentence, the Federal Court of Criminal Appeal enhanced the sentences to include 18 months' and 2 years' imprisonment respectively in addition to the fines already imposed and held:-
""In ordinary circumstances, petty theft would not have attracted any immediate sentences of imprisonment but when one considers the extent to which the stealing of motorcar parts and accessories is rife at the present day, then the Court inevitably must view such an offence as a very serious crime indeed... the public are entitled to be protected if lenient sentences are passed .. if an immediate prison sentence is necessary, as I believe to be the case here, then it should be consistent with the duty to protect the interests of the public and to punish and deter the criminal.""
Even with petty thefts, custodial sentences have been imposed when they become rife. The Lord Chief Justice in 
R v Upton
 (1982) 2 (S.) 132 expressed this view:-
""This was petty theft and in ordinary circumstances it would, and should, not have attracted any immediate sentence of imprisonment at all. But when one considers the extent to which pilfering is rife at the moment, it is quite plain that where the person charged with the securing of the premises helps himself to his employer's goods, steals them, then the court inevitably must take a serious view. So in principle the learned judge was perfectly right in imposing an immediate prison sentence. With that we do not quarrel for one moment.""
A 
fortiori
, when theft from a motor vehicle is rife.”
11.       Second, the accused had systematically committed these offences for a profit over a three month period from July to September 2004 at various car parks all over the island. Thereafter, he would appropriate the value in these cash cards by obtaining refunds at ATMs at different locations.  Third, although the amount involved in each single charge is not large, the total sum stolen (including the charges taken into consideration) amounted to $1,034.51, which is not an insignificant sum. Fourth, the manner in which he carried out the offences clearly shows some element of premeditation and planning. He would visit such busy car parks at a time when many of the vehicle owners had left their motorcycles unattended there before carrying out his crimes. Thereafter, he would extract the remaining value in the cash cards at the nearby ATMs. Where the offences are pre-mediated, deterrent sentences may well be of considerable value: 
PP v Ng Bee Ling Lana
 
[1992] 1 SLR 635
 and 
R v Sergeant
 (1974) 60 Cr App R 74.
12.       In determining the sentences to be imposed, the Court had regard to the fact that the accused person had pleaded guilty to the charges at the first instance and had co-operated with the police. It is pertinent to note that where public interest is involved, a plea of guilt does not automatically entitle a discount in sentencing: see 
Balasubramaniam Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 314
 and 
Fu Foo Tong
 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
.
 As mentioned earlier, the public interest would be advanced with the imposition of stiff sentences in this case. Nevertheless, I did place some weight to his plea of guilt and his co-operation with the police as these would have been helpful to the police in solving the crimes with respect to the section 403 Penal Code charges. Although the accused is not a first offender, his antecedents are dissimilar in nature to the present offences. Hence, I did not consider the accused’s previous drug-related antecedents when sentencing him: see Roslan bin Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor 
[1999] 2 SLR 211
 and Public Prosecutor v Norhisham bin Mohamad Dahlan 
[2004] 1 SLR 48
.
13.       I was mindful that there were a total of one hundred and twelve similar offences (sixty-four charges of theft and forty nine similar charges of criminal misappropriation) and one fraudulent possession charge that were taken into consideration. This would justify the imposition of a longer sentence than would otherwise be imposed for the ten offences that the Accused had pleaded guilty to: see 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
 at 142E.
14.       Having considered the seriousness of the offences, the circumstances of the case, the mitigating and aggravating factors and the element of public interest involved, the Court sentences the accused as follows:
DAC 53038/04 (Theft)             -           8 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52762/04 (Theft)             -           8 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52763/04 (Theft)             -           8 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52769/04 (Theft)             -           8 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52771/04 (Theft)             -           8 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52827/04 (S 403)           -           6 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52830/04 (S 403)           -           6 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52831/04 (S 403)           -           6 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52859/04 (S 403)           -           6 months’ imprisonment
DAC 52860/04 (S 403)           -           6 months’ imprisonment
15.       Having regard to the seriousness of the offences committed and the aggravating factors, I ordered the sentences in DAC 52762/04, DAC 52769/04, DAC 52771/04 and DAC 52827/04 to run consecutively. In totality, the Accused was sentenced to serve a total of 2 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with effect from 18 September 2004, being his date of remand.",2005-02-18 00:00:00,SG District Court

 The appellant was convicted on 8 September 2004 on the following charge:
You, Chew Seow Leng, Male/43 years, NRIC No S1510659Z
are charged that you, on or about the 7th day of January 2004 between 11.45 am and 12.05 pm, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (“the Act”) by having in your possession,
(i)
        
 4 packets of granular substance containing not less than 149.1 grams of diamorphine in a taxi bearing registration number SHA 3884X along Puay Hee Avenue, Singapore; and
(ii)
       
 a total of ten (10) packets, two (2) straws and one (1) container of granular substance containing not less than 77.47 grams of diamorphine at No 2 Topaz Road #03-01, Topaz Mansion, Singapore,
totalling 226.57 grams of diamorphine, of which more than 15 grams of diamorphine
 
are
 for the purpose of trafficking, without any authorisation under the Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Act and punishable under section 33 of the Act.
[emphasis added]
2
         
 We dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence, and set out our reasons below.
The facts
3
         
 On 7 January 2004, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), acting on information received, spotted and trailed the appellant. The officers intercepted the taxi the appellant was travelling in and arrested him. A red paper bag, containing another yellow paper bag, was found next to the appellant on the rear seat. The red paper bag was later found to contain 149.1g of diamorphine.
4
         
 After his arrest, the appellant gave a statement to Senior Station Inspector Siew Lai Lone. He admitted to owning the red paper bag, and said that it contained 4
lb
 of heroin that he had obtained from his supplier. He also disclosed the address of his rented apartment (“the apartment”).
5
         
 A second party of CNB officers, led by Staff Sergeant Tony Ng (“SSgt Ng”), took over custody of the appellant and the exhibits seized from the taxi. The appellant was brought to the apartment, where two Chinese males, Boo Hang Guang (“Boo”) and Tan Ah Leng (“Tan”), were found, and arrested. The appellant led the officers to various parts of the master bedroom and adjoining toilet, from which a total of 77.47g of diamorphine was seized. A pocket weighing scale and more than 3,000 small empty plastic packets were also recovered.
6
         
 SSgt Ng recorded a second statement from the appellant, in which the appellant again admitted that there were 4
lb
 of heroin in the red paper bag. He said that while Boo and Tan occasionally went to the apartment to consume heroin and spend the night, they had nothing to do with the drugs seized.
7
         
 SSgt Ng took custody of the exhibits seized from the apartment. He later handed over custody of all the exhibits seized from the taxi and the apartment to the investigating officer, Assistant Superintendent Goh Boon Pin (“ASP Goh”), after informing ASP Goh of where the exhibits were found. ASP Goh took the exhibits back to the CNB headquarters, where they were kept in a locked safe and cabinet in his office. On the night of 7 January 2004, ASP Goh weighed the drugs in the presence of the appellant, who did not dispute their weight.
8
         
 The appellant exhibited drug withdrawal symptoms later that night and was referred to Changi Prison Hospital. There, he told both a staff nurse and Dr Mohd Emran Mamat (“Dr Emran”) that he had consumed about one packet of heroin a day for the preceding two months, and three straws on the morning of 7 January 2004. The appellant subsequently recovered and was discharged.
9
         
 In his statements to ASP Goh made after his discharge from Changi Prison Hospital, the appellant, who was unemployed, said that he had resumed selling heroin because he was heavily indebted to loan sharks. The heroin seized from the apartment was the remainder of 4
lb
 he had purchased from his supplier in December 2003. He would repack 1
lb
 of heroin into 56 smaller packets, which he sold for $300 each. He would also take heroin from the small packets whenever he wanted to and consumed about one packet a day. The appellant reiterated that Boo and Tan had nothing to do with the drugs seized from the apartment, and said that he gave the two men heroin free of charge, although they would sometimes give him money and buy food for him.
10
       
 At trial, the Prosecution applied to amalgamate into one charge the original two separate charges in respect of the drugs seized from the taxi and the apartment. Defence counsel did not object, and the trial proceeded on the basis of the amalgamated charge. The appellant did not challenge the voluntariness of his statements. Boo and Tan both testified that the appellant had given them heroin free of charge. Tan added that he considered the appellant to be a heavier consumer of heroin than himself. However, Dr Emran testified that he was of the opinion that the appellant suffered only mild withdrawal symptoms. If the appellant actually consumed heroin at the rate he claimed, the symptoms that would have been exhibited would be more severe. The Prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Rasaiah Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), concurred with Dr Emran’s assessment. The appellant elected to remain silent when called upon to enter his defence, and no defence witnesses were called.
The decision below
11
       
 Tay Yong Kwang J found that the Prosecution’s evidence proved that the appellant was in possession of the drugs seized from the taxi and the apartment (see 
[2004] SGHC 227
). He was satisfied, on the evidence, that SSgt Ng had taken custody of the drugs seized from the taxi and had retained them until he handed them over to ASP Goh. Tay J likewise accepted ASP Goh’s evidence as to his handling of the exhibits, and noted that the appellant neither disputed the weight of the drugs when they were weighed in his presence nor qualified the amount seized in his later statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). Thus, Tay J found that there was no break in the chain of custody of the drugs.
12
       
 Since the amount of diamorphine seized from the appellant exceeded 2g, the statutory presumption in s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“ the MDA”) applied. The appellant was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, and bore the burden of rebutting the presumption on a balance of probabilities. Defence counsel, relying on the appellant’s statements to ASP Goh, submitted that the appellant consumed about 7.5g of heroin daily from his stock whenever he wanted to. He disagreed with the two doctors’ assessment of the severity of the appellant’s drug addiction. Finally, counsel submitted that it would be prudent to assume that the appellant would want to hold on to his heroin supplies because of, firstly, his high rate of consumption, and secondly, his evidence that his supplier would contact him when supplies were available but he could not contact his supplier to ask for supplies.
13
       
 However, Tay J decided that the appellant’s undisputed statements and the drug paraphernalia seized actually buttressed the statutory presumption that the appellant was trafficking in heroin. Further, he found no evidence upon which a meaningful apportionment of the drugs could be made between that meant for the appellant’s personal consumption and that meant for trafficking. In any event, even if the appellant’s contentions were accepted, there was no chance of arguing that the appellant had trafficked in 15g or less of diamorphine, such that he could escape the death penalty. Therefore, Tay J amended the charge to include the italicised words as shown at [1] above. The amended charge was read back to the appellant, who maintained his plea of “not guilty”.
14
       
 Finally, in response to the argument by defence counsel that the mandatory death penalty imposed under the MDA was unconstitutional, Tay J expressed his agreement with the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J in the High Court in 
PP v Nguyen Tuong Van
 
[2004] 2 SLR 328
.
The appeal
15
       
 At the hearing before us, the appellant’s present counsel criticised the amalgamation at the trial of the two original charges against the appellant. Other points were raised in written submissions but not pursued at the hearing. In addition, counsel contested the legality of the mandatory death penalty imposed under the MDA, notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Nguyen Tuong Van v PP
 
[2005] 1 SLR 103
 upholding the decision of Kan J in the High Court. We will address each issue in turn.
Amalgamation of charges
16
       
 Counsel for the appellant argued that Tay J should not have allowed the Prosecution to proceed with the amalgamated charge, as the drugs seized from the taxi and the apartment constituted two distinct and separate charges. Consequently, the amalgamated charge was bad for duplicity and contrary to s 168 of the CPC, which requires each distinct offence to be the subject of a separate charge. Recognising that s 396 of the CPC operated such that the appellant’s conviction would be disturbed only if the duplicity of charges alleged occasioned a failure of justice, counsel cited case authorities where duplicity of charges was held to occasion a failure of justice.
17
       
 We rejected this argument. It was not disputed that the two quantities of drugs seized were found at different places and times. However, counsel for the appellant failed to explain how this fact advanced the appellant’s case that the two quantities should have been the subject of two separate charges.
18
       
 As the Prosecution submitted, the crux of the appellant’s charge was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking. For the appellant to be found to have been in possession of the drugs, he must have had physical control of the drugs and knowledge of their existence: 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
.
19
       
 There could be no issue as to the drugs seized from the taxi. The drugs were found in the red paper bag next to the appellant, and the appellant admitted in his statements that he owned the bag and knew what its contents were.
20
       
 As for the drugs seized from the apartment, the appellant clearly knew of their existence. Indeed, he indicated their locations to the CNB officers conducting the search. With regards to physical control, the appellant was not precluded from being in possession of the drugs in the apartment at the time of his arrest merely because he was arrested in the taxi before the apartment was searched. The drugs need not be found on the appellant physically for him to be in physical control of the drugs for the purposes of s 17 of the MDA: 
Shahary bin Sulaiman v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 457
 at [10].
21
       
 The apartment was rented by the appellant alone. All the drugs seized from the apartment were found in the master bedroom and adjoining toilet. The appellant repeatedly said in his statements that Boo and Tan used the other bedroom when they slept over, and that they had to inform him first before they entered or left the apartment. Since only the appellant had access to and the use of the master bedroom and toilet, he had custody and control of, and thus was in possession of, the drugs seized from the apartment.
22
       
 In the circumstances of this case, the amalgamation of the original charges was proper. It is clear that the Prosecution has a wide discretion to determine the charges that are preferred against an offender: 
Thiruselvam s/o Nagaratnam v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 125
.
 Multiple charges of drug possession for the purposes of trafficking in different locations and at different times may be amalgamated: 
Yong Yow Chee v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 273
.
 The weight of each of the two quantities of heroin seized from the appellant exceeded the 15g threshold that would trigger the mandatory death penalty under the MDA. The two quantities were seized in quick succession within 20 minutes. The same standards of proof and statutory presumptions would have been applicable. This case, however, did not involve the amalgamation of multiple charges of drug possession where the quantity involved in each charge fell below the statutory threshold for invoking the death penalty, but where the combined quantity would cross the threshold.
23
       
 The cases cited by counsel for the appellant on the duplicity of charges were all distinguishable from this case. 
Tham Wing Fai Peter v PP
 
[1988] SLR 424
 and 
Chinniah v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 59
 were cases where the offenders were properly convicted on multiple distinct charges where each criminal act constituted a separate offence. The case of 
See Yew Poo v PP
 
[1949] MLJ 131
 involved one charge that disclosed an offence punishable under two different provisions. Finally, 
Wee Hui Hoo v PP
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 498
 and 
Muthan v PP
 
[1947] MLJ 86
 were cases that involved alternative provisions creating separate and distinct offences. None of these situations were applicable to this appeal, and there was no issue as to any duplicity of charges in this case.
24
       
 In any event, there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was misled by the amalgamation of the original charges, or that a failure of justice was occasioned as a result. The appellant was represented by counsel at his trial, and neither he nor his counsel raised any objections to the amalgamation. In these circumstances, it was insufficient for the appellant to submit on appeal that he had been misled because he was a layman ignorant of the law.
Chain of custody of the drug exhibits
25
       
 The appellant criticised the evidence of SSgt Ng and ASP Goh as to the custody and handling of the drugs seized from him. It is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact made by the trial judge, unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence or plainly wrong. The appellate court must bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings and reasons: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
, 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
.
 This is especially the case where the findings turn on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
26
       
 The appellant seized on the apparent lack of clarity in SSgt Ng’s evidence on SSgt Ng’s cross-examination by defence counsel, which was said to cast doubt on the chain of custody of the various drug exhibits. However, what was evident from the transcript was that there was some degree of miscommunication and antagonism between SSgt Ng and defence counsel, which affected to some degree the clarity of SSgt Ng’s evidence. Nevertheless, the essence of SSgt Ng’s evidence could still be discerned.
27
       
 Tay J had found that SSgt Ng had taken custody of the red paper bag seized from the taxi. SSgt Ng had brought the bag to the apartment and had held on to it until ASP Goh arrived, after which he handed over custody of the bag to ASP Goh. Although SSgt Ng could not recall exactly when the handover took place and did not make a record of the handover, there was nothing to suggest that the handover did not take place, or that there was any mix-up or impropriety with the handling of the bag. Likewise, the evidence was clear that SSgt Ng had taken and retained physical custody of the exhibits seized from the apartment until he handed them over to ASP Goh. He made it clear in his evidence that he had in fact handed the exhibits over, and did not merely recite as his evidence the usual practice for handling drug exhibits. No other quantities of drugs were seized from the appellant apart from those seized from the taxi and the apartment, and CNB did not conduct any other arrests on 7 January 2004.
28
       
 Turning to ASP Goh, Tay J noted that there was no requirement that ASP Goh give SSgt Ng a written acknowledgment when the latter handed over the exhibits to him. We saw no reason to depart from this, although it may be desirable as a matter of practice for such acknowledgments to be given when drug exhibits are transferred by one officer to another, to ensure that the exhibits are accounted for at all times. In light of the evidence of ASP Goh, the absence of this acknowledgment did not undermine the Prosecution’s case. ASP Goh had fully accounted for his handling of the exhibits at all times, and there was no evidence that the integrity of the exhibits was impaired by their storage in his locked safe and cabinet. The appellant argued that the drugs, which had been weighed in his presence, should also have been sealed in his presence, with him acknowledging that the weighing and sealing had been conducted before him. However, there was no requirement that the exhibits be sealed in the appellant’s presence.
29
       
 We found no reason in the present case to disturb the findings of fact made by Tay J. It is crucial to note that the appellant never challenged the weight of the drugs seized from him, both when the drugs were weighed before him on the night of 7 January 2004 and in his cautioned statements recorded later. Tay J had also ruled out the possibility of a mix-up in the exhibits.
Circumstantial evidence confirming the presumption of trafficking
30
       
 The appellant argued that Tay J had wrongly found that the empty plastic packets and pocket weighing scale seized from the apartment supported the presumption of trafficking under s 17(c) of the MDA. He claimed that he could have finished all the drugs seized given sufficient time as he was a hard-core addict who had been detained at drug rehabilitation centres on six previous occasions. He asserted that the two doctors’ assessments of his drug addiction on the basis of the withdrawal symptoms he exhibited were inconclusive. Finally, Tan had given evidence that he considered the appellant to be an even more severe addict than he was.
31
       
 The appellant was found in possession of two quantities of heroin. The weight of each quantity far exceeded the 2g threshold for diamorphine beyond which the presumption of trafficking under the MDA applied. As the learned judge said, the burden therefore fell on the appellant to rebut this presumption. However, the appellant failed to do so.
32
       
 It is established law that possession of drug trafficking paraphernalia may be relevant as circumstantial evidence of drug trafficking: 
Chan Hock Wai v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 728
.
 The pocket weighing scale and empty plastic packets would have been useful for the purposes of drug trafficking, and had been recovered from the apartment along with a substantial quantity of heroin. The appellant did not explain why these items were found there, which he would have had little need for had he merely been a drug consumer.
33
       
 Tay J had correctly refused to apportion the drugs seized from the appellant into portions for the appellant’s consumption and for trafficking. The test for apportionment in 
Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 29
 requires credible evidence that part of the drugs seized was meant for self-consumption, as well as of the offender’s rate of consumption and the number of days the drugs were meant for. It was insufficient to rely on the mere say-so of the offender. However, at trial, the appellant relied almost entirely on his statement to ASP Goh that he consumed one packet of heroin a day. This evidence was clearly inadequate. No new evidence pertaining to the appellant’s drug consumption and addiction was adduced before us.
34
       
 Furthermore, Tay J, after refusing to apportion the drugs seized from the appellant, had nonetheless gone on to comprehensively consider the appellant’s arguments, assuming the appellant’s stated rate of consumption to be correct. He concluded that there was a significant shortfall that was unaccounted for between the 4
lb
 the appellant obtained in December 2003 and the 2
lb
 seized from the apartment, factoring in the amount the appellant could have consumed. As for the drugs seized from the taxi, Tay J had found it unlikely that the appellant had obtained that substantial quantity to hoard it for his own consumption, when he was unemployed and heavily indebted to loan sharks. The appellant himself had said that his financial difficulties were the reason he resorted to drug trafficking. Once again, the appellant failed to demonstrate why Tay J’s decision here should be disturbed.
35
       
 It was insufficient for the appellant to simply rely on the possibility raised in the evidence of Dr Emran and Dr Winslow of exceptional cases where a severe drug addict would fail to exhibit correspondingly severe drug withdrawal symptoms, without going on to show that he was indeed such an addict. Dr Emran, who had examined the appellant, was of the opinion that the appellant exhibited only mild withdrawal symptoms. Dr Winslow, concurring with Dr Emran, added that it was generally unlikely for a severe drug addict to exhibit only mild withdrawal symptoms. In the face of the evidence of Dr Emran and Dr Winslow, Tan’s evidence was of little value in this case. Tan based his opinion on his observing the appellant consuming heroin on each of the seven or eight times he stayed over at the apartment, presumably using his own drug consumption as a yardstick. This was an inadequate and inconclusive basis for any credible conclusion on the severity of the appellant’s drug addiction.
36
       
 The appellant asserted in written submissions that the rate of consumption of a hard-core heroin addict with easy access to heroin would rise exponentially, as he required ever higher quantities to achieve the same level of satisfaction. This was a completely new point that was not canvassed at trial, and was not substantiated in submissions. Further, counsel for the appellant saw fit to support this bare assertion by including as exhibits pages apparently downloaded off the Internet without making a proper application to adduce fresh evidence on appeal. In any case, the material exhibited would not have satisfied the test for adducing fresh evidence set out in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
 and affirmed in cases such as 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
.
 The material could have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at trial. A perusal showed it to be extremely broad and general, with no indication of the credentials of the writer and publisher, which thus undermined its relevance and credibility.
Reliance on the appellant’s statements
37
       
 Counsel for the appellant submitted that Tay J was wrong to place much weight on the appellant’s statements when the voluntariness of the statements had not been tested. This argument is seriously flawed. At no time during the trial did the appellant challenge the voluntariness of any of his statements, expressly or otherwise. Consequently, there was no need for the Prosecution to prove that the statements were made voluntarily in this case: 
PP v Mohamed Noor bin Jantan
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 289
.
 In his written submissions on appeal, he also did not challenge the voluntariness of his statements. The statements were admissible as evidence, and Tay J was free to place such weight on them as was appropriate in light of the circumstances and other evidence. To accept the appellant’s arguments would mean accepting the illogical proposition that the appellant’s silence in the face of his inculpatory statements rendered the statements unreliable, when there was no material to test the statements against.
38
       
 The appellant never denied in his statements that he was engaged in drug trafficking or that he had given drugs free of charge to Boo and Tan. In his cautioned statements to ASP Goh, he went into significant detail as to how he carried out drug trafficking activities. During the trial, he did not dispute or deny the contents of these inculpatory statements, choosing to keep silent when called upon to enter his defence. Tay J had carefully scrutinised the statements and there was nothing to suggest that the weight Tay J had placed on the statements was wrong.
Legality of the mandatory death penalty
39
       
 Counsel for the appellant recognised that the Court of Appeal had just recently reiterated its position on the legality of the mandatory death penalty imposed under the MDA in its decision in 
Nguyen Tuong Van v PP
 ([15] 
supra
). We had held, after hearing exhaustive and wide-ranging argument, that the mandatory death penalty was constitutional and did not breach customary international law. Yet, in the same breath, counsel submitted that the death sentence imposed by the trial judge was unlawful and contravened the Constitution and international law, and invited this court to reconsider its position 
vis-à-vis
 the mandatory death penalty. There was an obvious contradiction in counsel’s submissions that he did not appear to be conscious of. Be that as it may, we affirmed the decision in 
Nguyen Tuong Van v PP
, and have nothing further to add.
40
       
 The rest of counsel’s submissions on this issue were disposed of briefly as they were generally not on point. Counsel’s suggestion that this court send a “memorandum of concern” to the Cabinet to consider an alternative sentence of life imprisonment for drug-trafficking offences was wholly inappropriate in view of the clear separation of powers under the Constitution. We also respectfully disagreed with counsel’s assertion that our society is indifferent to whether a convicted drug trafficker is hanged or imprisoned for life, now that a term of life imprisonment is for the remainder of the convict’s natural life. The mandatory death penalty imposed under the MDA reflects our society’s abhorrence of drug trafficking, and counsel presented nothing before this court to show that society’s views have changed on this issue. Furthermore, any changes to the MDA to reflect changing social attitudes towards drug offences, if indeed a change has taken place, is a matter that is, more appropriately, within the purview of Parliament.
Conclusion
41
       
 The appellant failed to sustain any of his grounds of appeal. He consistently maintained that he alone was in possession of the drugs seized from him, and his statements in this regard remained unchallenged. His silence in the face of his own voluntary statements and the circumstantial evidence was telling. No serious challenge was mounted to the chain of custody of the drug exhibits or to the findings of Tay J. In these circumstances, there was no reason to disturb the appellant’s conviction and sentence.

District Judge Ronald Gwee
1.         The accused, Magenderan s/o Marimuthu (“Magenderan”), pleaded guilty to one charge under Section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”). The charge stated that Magenderan had, on 27 January 2005 at about 2.27 am, driven motor car SFP 2945 E (the “car”) along Steven Road when he had 72 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres in his breath, which exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The proportion of alcohol in Magenderan’s breath was 
72
 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath and this was 
more than double
 the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath.
2.         Magenderan admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted on the charge he faced. After considering Magenderan’s written mitigation plea presented by his Counsel, I sentenced Magenderan to a fine of $3,300 and disqualified him from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 26 months. Magenderan filed his own appeal and appealed against the order of disqualification.
3.         The SOF recited that one Sgt Edward Pee, attached to the Traffic Police, was performing police road block duties and had stopped Magenderan for a “spot check”. Sgt Pee suspected that Magenderan had been driving the car whilst under the influence of “drink” and conducted a breathalyzer test on Magenderan. Magenderan failed the test. Magenderan was escorted to the Traffic Police Headquarters where a Breath Evidential Analyser test was conducted. This test resulted in the aforesaid reading of 72 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The Prosecution said that Magenderan had no antecedents.
4.         In the written mitigation plea, it was stated that Magenderan was a single parent with 4 young children to support. Magenderan was also supporting his aged father who had medical problems. Magenderan is an operations/marketing manager with Whitefield Security Services Pte Ltd and was said to be a diligent worker. His employment required him to drive. The mitigation plea stated that at about 1.00 am on 27 January 2005, Magenderan was on his way to a job site and stopped to have a meal at St George’s Road. He met some old friends there. These friends invited Magenderan for a drink. Magenderan consumed 2 bottles of beer whilst with his friends. Subsequently Magenderan was driving towards Holland Road when he was stopped at a road block. Magenderan was said to be “totally remorseful” and assured that he would not commit “such an offence ever again”. Magenderan was said to be a person of good character who “never intended to drink and drive”. The Defence Counsel characterized the case as one of “really an error of judgment in having the two bottles of beer before he left for his worksite”. The Defence Counsel urged the Court not to pass a custodial sentence on Magenderan.
5.         The prescribed punishment for a first offender for an offence under Section 67(1) of the RTA is a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. 
For a conviction under Section 67(1) of the RTA, disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of at least 12 months is mandatory (Section 67(2)) unless the Court for “special reasons” is minded to order otherwise (a period of shorter than 12 months, or not at all, or to restrict the disqualification to certain classes of vehicles). If “special reasons” are not shown, the Court has no discretion in the matter and has to order the disqualification to cover all classes of vehicles, and has to order disqualification for a period of at least 12 months.  The Court has power to order a longer period of disqualification if deemed fit.
6.         
It is trite that the level of alcohol found in an offender’s breath (or blood as the case may be) would affect the sentence to be meted out. In 
Ong Beng Soon v Public Prosecutor 
[1992] 1 SLR 731
; 
[1992] SGHC 48
, The Honourable the Chief Justice stated that a “person substantially over the limit is obviously in more flagrant violation of the Act than a person marginally over the limit”. This was repeated by The Honourable the Chief Justice in 
Silvalingam Sinnasamy v Public Prosecutor 
[2001] 3 SLR 157
; 
[2001] SGHC 154
.
7.         Magenderan had an alcohol reading of 72 microgrammes, which was more than double the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes. In respect of the period of disqualification to be meted out (for a conviction under Section 67(1) of the RTA) where the alcohol reading was 72 microgrammes, the tariff would be 2 to 3 years.
8.         Parliament deemed it fit to prescribe that a person convicted under Section 67(1) shall (unless special reasons are shown) be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of at least 12 months. This period of 12 months has further significance, as under Section 43 (1)(b) of the RTA, where a person is disqualified for a period of one year or longer, that person’s driving licence shall be “of no effect” and the person is further prevented from driving a motor vehicle after the period of disqualification “unless he passes the prescribed test of competence to drive”. The offender’s driving licence is effectively taken away from the offender and he would have to pass the required test again to prove his competence to take to the road once more.
9.         A disqualification order of at least 12 months must therefore be seen not only as punishment, but also as protection for the majority of road users who are law-abiding. An offender who commits an offence under Section 67(1) has to be kept off the roads to protect the public, and the offender must prove, at the end of his disqualification period, that he is once again fit to be allowed to drive on the roads. It is clear, from the cases of 
Ong Beng Soon
 and 
Silvalingam Sinnasamy
, that the higher the level of alcohol, the harsher the sentence (including the period of disqualification) ought to be.
10.       The Traffic Police have been relentless in their several campaigns against “drink driving”. The Traffic Police have been continually trying to impress upon the motoring public that drinking and driving “do not mix” and that if one drinks, one should not drive. Such campaigns are intensified during festive periods, and the Traffic Police employ several media to spread their message. Magenderan committed the offence on 27 January 2005, during a period when such messages from the Traffic Police would have been at a higher level. Magenderan had consumed alcoholic drinks sufficient to push the alcohol content in his breath to 72 microgrammes (Magenderan admitted to consuming 2 bottles of beer, as stated in his mitigation plea), a reading of more than double the prescribed limit, and yet decided to drive, completely ignoring the messages which the Traffic Police have tried to drum into the consciousness of the motoring public. To take to the roads notwithstanding the previous consumption of alcohol demonstrated a reckless attitude to road safety and strongly suggested risk-taking of a high order. I cannot accept that Magenderan had merely made “an error of judgment”. The high level of alcohol in Magenderan’s system showed the magnitude of the risk that Magenderan had apparently taken on that occasion. A strong message must be sent out to persons such as Magenderan, that driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or with an alcohol level exceeding the prescribed limit is a very serious offence, and that such offenders would be severely punished.
11.       Magenderan had placed all road users around him at risk. Nearly everybody uses the roads, whether as drivers, riders, cyclists, passengers, pillion, pedestrians and commuters. The importance of road safety cannot be over-emphasised. The most serious aggravating factor in this case was the very high reading of 72 microgrammes.
12.       As stated above, the prescribed punishment was a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. The combination of the very high alcohol reading of 72 microgrammes and the aggravating factors merited a serious consideration of whether a custodial sentence would be appropriate in this case, or whether a heavy fine would be sufficient.
13.       “Drink driving” cases are on the rise. In the Singapore Police Force Annual 2004, the Traffic Police reported that 2,389 persons were arrested for drink driving in 2003, compared to 1,895 persons arrested for the offence in 2002. This represented an increase of 26.1%. In a Straits Times report on 30 August 2004, it was reported that drink driving cases in the first half of 2004 rose by about 25% compared to the same period in 2003. In a Channelnewsasia report on 4 December 2004, it was reported that between January and September 2004, “more than 1,900 drunk drivers were arrested, up 30 percent over the same period last year (2003)”. This upward trend is indeed worrying. The Courts must reflect its stern view of such offences in its sentencing policies with regard to cases of drink driving.
14.       In Defence Counsel’s mitigation plea, it was urged upon the Court to “consider the “special circumstances” in this case and, to consider exercising your discretion not to order any disqualification of his licence. Even if your Honour deems compelled to disqualify him, I urge your Honour to only disqualify him from driving Class 3 vehicle (car) and not Class…2B (motorcycle).” It is trite that unless “special reasons” are shown, the Court has no choice but to order disqualification for all classes of vehicles (as the words “be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence” in Section 67(2) of the RTA do not allow for the restriction of the effect of the disqualification order to only certain classes. This is in contrast to Section 42(1) and (3) of the RTA which deal with “discretionary” disqualification orders.) Similarly, unless “special reasons” are shown, the Court must order disqualification for a period of at least 12 months.
15.       What then are “special reasons”? In the case of 
Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor 
[2002] 2 SLR 73
, The Honourable the Chief Justice set out that a “special reason” may comprise “a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment”. The Honourable the Chief Justice continued, “It is clear that whether the facts of the case amount to ‘special reasons’ is a question of law and should be decided in view of the circumstances surrounding the offender’s commission of the offence.” So the factors to be considered are not the personal factors surrounding the individual offender, but the factors surrounding the commission of the offence. It has been suggested that nothing short of an emergency may give rise to a possible finding that “special reasons” existed (see for example 
Joseph Roland v Public Prosecutor 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
). In 
Sivakumar
 (
supra
) The Honourable the Chief Justice explained that “(b)efore an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a crucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving”.
16.       A perusal of the written mitigation plea indicates quite clearly that no “special reasons” existed in this particular case. In fact, Counsel chose to use the term “special circumstances” in the mitigation plea. There were no compelling reasons for Magenderan to have driven at the material time. As stated above, where no special reasons exist, the Court has no discretion in the matter: disqualification must cover all classes of vehicles, and must be for at least 12 months.
17.       After a consideration of the factors and circumstances in this case, and Magenderan’s mitigation plea, it was decided that an imprisonment term was not warranted in the present case and that a heavy fine was sufficient to send out the message to Magenderan and other like-minded motorists that such offences cannot be tolerated. A long disqualification period was also warranted.
18.       In all the circumstances, a fine of $3,300 was considered appropriate. It was also necessary to keep Magenderan off the roads for a sufficiently long period of time to impress upon Magenderan the importance of placing road safety above any personal consideration. The public on our roads (including any passengers that may be in the person’s vehicle) must be kept safe from deliberate risk takers who throw caution to the wind and take to the roads when they are not in a fit state to do so. As stated in paragraph 7 above, the tariff disqualification period for the level found in Magenderan’s system (72 microgrammes) is from 2 to 3 years. After considering all the circumstances of the case, I imposed a disqualification period of 26 months.",2005-03-15 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge Ronald Gwee
1.         The accused, Sim Ju Kuan (“Sim”), pleaded guilty to 4 charges relating to a motor lorry, licence number YG 8679 G (“lorry”). In summary, the 4 charges stated that Sim had used the lorry after the registration of the lorry had been cancelled, and when there was no valid vehicle licence and no requisite insurance coverage for the lorry, and had as the director of Luxuriant Landscape Nursery Pte Ltd (“Luxuriant”) kept the lorry for which there was no valid vehicle licence.
2.         Sim understood the nature of the charges he faced. He pleaded guilty to the 4 charges and understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The Statement of Facts (“SOF”) was read out to Sim. Sim admitted to the facts in the SOF without qualification. I convicted Sim of the 4 charges, on his plea of guilt. The Prosecution stated that Sim had no antecedents. After hearing Sim’s mitigation plea, I imposed a fine of $600 for each of the 4 charges. In addition, as I found that there were no “special reasons” shown in Sim’s case, I was compelled to impose a disqualification order against Sim for the 3
rd
 charge. The 3
rd
 charge was for failing to have the requisite insurance coverage as required by the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (“MV Act”), an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of the MV Act. Section 3(3) of the MV Act provides that a person convicted of an offence under that section “shall (unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification) be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction”.
3.         The court has the power to order a longer period of disqualification. Once the court finds that no special reasons had been shown, a minimum period of 12 months had to be considered. The tariff period of disqualification for a conviction under Section 3 of the MV Act is between 12 to 18 months, for a first offender, pleading guilty at the mentions stage. After considering all the circumstances, and Sim’s mitigation plea, I ordered that Sim be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 15 months. Sim filed a Notice of Appeal, against only the disqualification order.
4.         The SOF stated that the complainant was SSgt Tan Jit Cheng, attached to the Enforcement Unit of the Land Transport Authority. On 2 July 2004 at 10.55 am, SSgt Tan had stopped Sim, who was driving the lorry along Woodlands Road. The registration of the lorry had been cancelled on 14 June 2004. The vehicle licence of the lorry had expired on 14 June 2003. There was no requisite insurance coverage for the lorry on 2 July 2004. The first 3 charges had been made out. In addition, the SOF also stated that Luxuriant was the registered owner of the lorry, and that Sim was a director of Luxuriant. Thus Sim (who was driving the lorry) was also guilty of possessing the lorry when there was no valid vehicle licence in force for the lorry (the 4
th
 charge).
5.         In his oral mitigation plea, Sim said that he regretted committing the offences. The offences were committed due to “financial problems”, and Sim pleaded for leniency. Sim said that he was a volunteer with a group known as “Crime Library”. Sim said that he drove around volunteers of the Crime Library. Sim said that if he were to lose his driving licence, he could not continue his community service, and his family would be in financial difficulties.
6.         The 4 charges Sim faced related to strict liability offences. As a director of Luxuriant, the fact that the registration of the lorry had been cancelled, and that there was no valid vehicle licence and no requisite insurance coverage ought to have been known to Sim. If these facts were not known personally to Sim, it was incumbent upon Sim to ensure that the lorry was still registered for use on the roads, and had a valid vehicle licence and insurance coverage, before he drove the lorry. That he did not ensure that it was “legal” to drive the lorry on the material day was clear, in the circumstances. Sim did not offer any valid reason or excuse for his transgressions, save to say that the offences were committed due to “financial problems”. Sim clearly failed to discharge the duties imposed on drivers and those in possession of vehicles, by the MV Act and the Road Traffic Act, to ensure, 
inter alia
, that a vehicle was still registered, and had a valid vehicle licence and requisite insurance coverage before it could be used on the roads.
7.         In Paragraph 53 of 
Chua Chye Tiong v PP 
[2004] 1 SLR 22
, 
[2003] SGHC 261
, The Honourable the Chief Justice reiterated what he had held in the case of 
Sriekaran s/o Thanka Samy v PP 
[1998] 3 SLR 402
: that the policy behind the MV Act’s mandatory disqualification provision was to deter “vehicles being used in circumstances endangering the user and other persons on the road, leaving such persons without compensation should the user not be able to satisfy the judgment”.
8.         Sim had failed to demonstrate that any special reasons existed in this case. On the question of what amounted to a “special reason”, The Honourable the Chief Justice in 
Chua Chye Tiong v PP
 (
supra
) said that “the law on this issue is clear”. The Chief Justice cited the case of 
Re Kanapathipillai 
[1960] MLJ 243
, in which it was held that a “special reason” was one “special to the facts which constitute the offence”. Further, the Chief Justice said that “(s)uch a special fact may not amount in law to a defence to the charge but would be one which the court ought to take into consideration when imposing punishment. However, a circumstance peculiar to the offender would not be a “special reason” within the exception.”
9.         Further in 
Chua Chye Tiong v PP
 (
supra
) the Chief Justice cited the Malaysian case of 
PP v Hiew Chin Fong 
[1988] 1 MLJ 467
, which listed the following as 
not
 amounting to “special reasons”: “(a)…financial hardship to the offender; (b) that the offender knew no other means of earning his livelihood; (c) that the effect of the disqualification must necessarily and consequently deprive the offender of his livelihood or occupation; and (d) that the offender was a poor man and would have difficulty to get to his work”.
10.       In the case of 
Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v PP 
[2002] 2 SLR 73
 (a case involving, 
inter alia
, an issue whether the circumstances in that case amounted to “special reasons” sufficient to escape the mandatory disqualification provision in Section 67 of the Road Traffic Act) The Honourable the Chief Justice said that “(b)efore an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a crucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving”. There was apparently no emergency which led to Sim having to drive the lorry.
11.       From a consideration of Sim’s mitigation plea, the circumstances raised by Sim do not amount to “special reasons”, upon a reading of 
PP v Hiew Chin Fong
 (
supra
). The fact that Sim was in financial difficulties or had financial problems does not qualify as a “special reason”. The possibility or the likelihood that the disqualification order would severely affect his livelihood (or even take it away) or place his family in financial difficulties does not qualify as a “special reason”. Sim had not shown any reason or reasons “special to the facts which constitute the offence”. Sim had failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the lorry not be kept or used after its registration had been cancelled, or to ensure that the lorry not be kept or used when there was no valid vehicle licence or requisite insurance coverage in force.
12.       The tariff period of disqualification for cases such as the present is, as stated above, 12 months (mandatory minimum) to 18 months. I considered the policy reasons behind the imposition of the mandatory disqualification (as set out in paragraph 7, 
supra
). I also assessed that Sim had placed the public using the roads around him at greater risk: Sim had been driving the lorry, a commercial vehicle larger and heavier than motorcycles and most motor cars. Sim had also been caught driving the lorry on 2 July 2004, which was a Friday, at about 10.55 am along Woodlands Road. The possibility of Sim causing harm on the roads was increased as he had been driving on the roads during a busier part of the morning on a weekday.
13.       After considering all the circumstances, including the aggravating factors and Sim’s mitigation plea, I considered that a fine of $600 for each of the 4 charges was appropriate. In respect of the 3
rd
 charge, I considered that a disqualification period of 15 months was appropriate and I so ordered. As stated earlier, Sim’s appeal was only in respect of the disqualification order.",2005-03-22 00:00:00,SG District Court

Tay Yong Kwang J:
1          The accused is now 19 years old. He pleaded guilty to the following charge that he:
on or about the 1st day of May 2004, at about 2.00 p.m., at Sports Link Pte Ltd, #02-13/15 of West Mall Shopping Centre, No. 1 Bukit Batok Central Link, Singapore, did commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Kelvin Yang Yi Wen, male 17 years old, with the intention of causing death, by inflicting an incised wound on the neck of the said Kelvin Yang Yi Wen with a knife, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Under the said provision of law, the court may sentence the accused to imprisonment for life or for up to ten years. The court may also impose a fine or order caning.
The facts
2          The accused was born on 28 May 1985. At the time of the offence, he was four weeks away from his 19th birthday. He was unemployed.
3          The accused and the deceased were classmates in 2000 when they were both Secondary 2 students in Guang Yang Secondary School. They could not get along with each other and often fought. The following year, they moved to different classes in Secondary 3. At the end of 2001, the accused left the school to study at an Institute of Technical Education. The two teenagers ceased to have contact thereafter. In July 2003, the deceased left the school and started work.
4          It appeared from the investigations that the accused hated the deceased very much since their school days. He claimed that the deceased had made fun of him, bullied him, scolded him with “bad words”, laughed at him and made “snake sounds” at him. He further claimed that in 2002, after his short stint at the Institute of Technical Education, he began to hear voices in Hokkien telling him that if he did not kill the deceased, people would get married. The accused disliked people getting married because he was evil. He then decided to kill the deceased. He claimed that several others, including his father and his classmates, also asked him to kill the deceased. Even the deceased himself asked him to kill him. The deceased was his enemy and he would lose face if he did not kill him.
5          The accused then began looking for the deceased. He bought knives on a few occasions and, when he could not locate the deceased, would throw them away before returning home. Sometimes, he would bring a kitchen knife from his home.
6          On 30 April 2004, the accused went to West Mall Shopping Centre (“West Mall”) to do some shopping and also to look for the deceased. Quite fortuitously, he saw the deceased at the sports goods shop there. The deceased had been working as a part-time staff there for about six months. The accused observed the deceased from a distance for a while and then left for home.
7          The next day, the accused went to the same shopping mall with a knife that he had bought a few months back and which he kept at home. Upon arriving at the mass rapid transit station next to West Mall, he put on a pair of sunglasses to avoid being recognised by the deceased. He went up to the sports goods shop and pretended to browse. A sales assistant went up to him to offer his assistance but the accused merely stared at him and continued walking around. The supervisor of the shop spoke to the deceased who informed him that the accused was his former classmate and he had some mental problems.
8          When the deceased was about to walk out of the shop to buy some food, the accused took out the knife from his front right trousers pocket to try to stab the deceased at the back of his neck. A struggle ensued and both fell to the ground whereupon the accused stabbed the deceased’s neck. The deceased became motionless. None of the shop’s staff and customers dared to approach the accused as he was still holding the knife. One Caucasian customer asked him to drop the knife but was chased by the accused out of the shop. The shop’s supervisor then telephoned the police while another staff member ran out of the shop to get assistance from security officers of the mall.
9          The accused returned to the shop, walked up to the deceased’s motionless body and began to stab him repeatedly in the stomach, the neck and the face. He then walked out of the shop and stood outside.
10        Two of the mall’s security officers, Ayasamy Paliniappan and Kalidas s/o Rajendran (“Kalidas”), arrived outside the shop and wanted to prevent the accused from leaving. The accused pointed the bloodstained knife at them. He then walked about aimlessly in the shop. A cleaning supervisor, Anandan s/o Palanisamy Manickam (“Anandan”), arrived at the shop to help. The accused knelt down next to the deceased and stabbed him several more times. He then walked around the shop again, still holding the knife. A volunteer special constable from the Police Coast Guard, Imran bin Mawi, who happened to be at the mall at that time, also went up to the shop to render assistance. Kalidas took a metal rod from another shop and the four men confronted the accused, shouting to him to drop the knife. After some time, the accused threw the knife on the floor. Anandan immediately punched him in the stomach and floored him. The men pinned the struggling accused down and subdued him. The two security officers then used their neckties to bind his hands and his legs.
11        The police arrived shortly thereafter and took over custody of the accused.
12        Dr Gilbert Lau, a forensic pathologist from the Health Sciences Authority, certified the deceased’s cause of death as due to severe, acute haemorrhage primarily caused by a deep, incised wound of the neck that had severed the right common carotid artery, incised the right internal jugular vein and transected the larynx and oropharynx. In total, the deceased suffered five incised wounds and 14 stab wounds at his head, neck and upper body.
13        On 6 May 2004, Dr Daniel Fung, a consultant psychiatrist from the Child Guidance Clinic, provided a medical report on the accused based entirely on medical records kept of the accused’s visits between December 2000 and March 2002. The accused was diagnosed to have Autistic Spectrum Disorder. During his sessions at the clinic, there were reports of him being physically aggressive towards his parents, having been reported to the police for overturning a cart in Bugis Junction and beating up a student in school. The family defaulted in follow-up sessions from March 2002.
14        Dr Cai Yiming, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health and Woodbridge Hospital, examined the accused on 20 and 24 May 2004. He found that the accused was aware he had killed the deceased who, he alleged, had scolded and bullied him when they were classmates in 2000. The accused was not sure the deceased had died after the first wound. He therefore returned to stab the deceased a few more times and felt “more comfortable” after knowing that he was really dead. Dr Cai concluded that the accused held persistent persecutory delusion and hallucination and was suffering from a schizophrenic illness probably since 2000. He was of the opinion that the accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence but his mental state amounted to an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired his criminal responsibility. He stated that the accused had intended to kill the deceased. The accused was assessed to be fit to plead and to stand trial.
15        In a supplementary report, Dr Cai opined that the accused would require long-term medication and treatment and was likely to be a danger to himself or to society.
16        Dr Cai was cross-examined on his opinions by the Defence. He was referred to extracts from 
Kaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry,
 (7th Ed, 2000) and to the 
Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry,
 (3rd Ed, 1996) at p 779, where guidelines on assessing “dangerousness” of patients were set out in a table. Defence counsel suggested to him that not all the factors mentioned there were satisfied in this case. Dr Cai replied that the said table concentrated on the nature of killing. He had, in offering his opinion, also taken into consideration factors relating to the nature of the illness. The accused is suffering from a serious mental illness, he is male (the prognosis for male patients is generally not as good as that for female patients) and the onset of his illness was a slow one. There was also a delay of around four years before treatment with poor premorbid adjustment. He killed without provocation. From Dr Cai’s observation of the accused’s conduct in court and the way he responded to the court’s questions, it was obvious to him that the accused’s condition has not improved and he is still unwell. For the present offence, it was the deceased who was the accused’s target but if the illness continues, the target may shift to someone else. Dr Cai recommended life-long treatment for the accused.
17        The accused had a clean record before this case. Because of the danger he poses to the public, the Prosecution submitted that the accused should be imprisoned for life.
The mitigation plea
18        The accused’s father, a retiree, is 63 years old. His mother, a clerical worker, is 56 years old. He has a 30-year-old brother and an identical twin brother.
19        He passed his Primary 6 examinations with an aggregate score of 182. While in secondary school, he was disruptive in class and could not get along with others because of his poor communication skills. On one occasion, he suddenly and gleefully poured a packet of soya bean drink over a teacher while she was eating alone in the school canteen. There was no provocation and the teacher had no previous interaction with him. On another occasion, he suddenly threw a book at the chest of another female teacher in class and looked gleeful after that. These acts, defence counsel submitted, were in the nature of childish pranks and not evidence of a violent disposition.
20        The deceased, it was alleged, armed with an iron rod, fought with the accused in school and punched him in the face on several occasions. He also challenged the accused to kill, used vulgarities against him and made hurtful remarks like calling the accused’s mother a prostitute.
21        The accused is autistic and was therefore exempted from performing National Service. While being treated at the Child Guidance Clinic between December 2000 and March 2002, he was disruptive and appeared to have no respect for anybody.
22        Dr Tan Chue Tin, a consultant psychiatrist in private practice, examined the accused recently on 16 February 2005 and interviewed his parents and his twin brother on a number of occasions. He reported that the accused heard a voice speaking in Hokkien in June 2003 telling him to kill the deceased as doing that would prevent men and women from getting married. He did not want people to get married because he was evil. His father, his classmates and even the deceased himself urged him to kill the deceased. Troubled by those voices, he began to search for the deceased and chanced upon him at West Mall.
23        Dr Tan agreed with the Prosecution’s Dr Cai that the accused suffers from schizophrenia, a major psychosis, and that he is fit to plead and to stand trial. Acknowledging that it was difficult to say whether or not the accused would commit murder again or would be a danger to society, Dr Tan opined that “it is more likely than not that Bernard is not prone to commit another murder (and therefore more likely than not that he is not danger to society)”. The target of his killing on 1 May 2004 was a specific person whom he hated and was therefore not a random killing. He stabbed no one else. There was no history of violence or of suicide-homicidal or sado-masochistic behaviour. The critical factor for arriving at this assessment was the accused’s satisfactory response to treatment and resolution of his hallucinatory and delusional psychotic symptoms.
24        Dr Tan was cross-examined by the Prosecution on his opinion. He was referred to the same materials put before Dr Cai. Dr Tan said that treating schizophrenia involved total management and that it was not necessarily confined to an institution. Family involvement, education and care were as important as medication. The accused’s family is very supportive in the care of the accused. Although the accused will suffer from schizophrenia for a long time, Dr Tan believed that with modern treatment and family care, the accused could be made to be as functionally normal as possible. He did not think that the accused would be less likely to comply with instructions to take medication. He was of the view that the accused had recovered partially by the time Dr Tan saw him in February 2005.
25        Defence counsel stated that the accused was well-behaved in the remand prison, spending his time reading. He no longer hears the voices in his head. He has pleaded guilty, thereby accepting responsibility for his actions and saving trial time. After the death of the deceased, there was nothing to suggest that the accused would suffer a relapse and repeat such an offence. He had been provoked by the actions and words of the deceased and other schoolmates while they were in the same school and “may have erred to protect his mother’s reputation”.
26        Based on the above, defence counsel urged the court to sentence the accused to the lower tier of ten years’ imprisonment in s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).
The decision of the court
27        Before sentencing the accused to imprisonment for life, I made the following remarks.
28        This gruesome killing of a teenager is a tragic case of one young life lost at the hands of an equally young man diagnosed, quite sadly, to be suffering from schizophrenia. In cases involving accused persons such as Mr Bernard Kok here, the law is clear – in deciding whether to impose imprisonment for life or for a term of up to ten years, the court has to consider the following factors:
(a)        Is the offence in itself grave enough to require a very long sentence?
(b)        Does it appear from the nature of the offence or from the history of the accused that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such an offence in the future?
(c)        If the offence is committed, would the consequences to others be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence?
A sentence of life imprisonment is justified if the answers to these three considerations are affirmative (see 
Neo Man Lee v PP
 
[1991] SLR 146
, 
PP v Ong Wee Teck
 
[2001] 3 SLR 479
 and 
PP v Kwok Teng Soon
 
[2001] 4 SLR 516
). Caning is not imposed in such cases as the accused persons would have been suffering from such abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired their mental responsibility for their acts.
29        In the above cited case of 
PP v Kwok Teng Soon
, a decision affirmed on appeal to the Court of Appeal, I expressed the view that the purpose of the three conditions in 
Neo Man Lee v PP
 is not to determine how evil a particular accused person can be but is to extrapolate from his condition and his actions the likelihood of a relapse and what the probable consequences might be in such an event.
30        The medical evidence from the Prosecution shows that the accused here has been suffering from a schizophrenic illness from around 2000 and that he held persistent persecutory delusion and hallucination. The prognosis for his illness, unfortunately, is likely to be poor. He probably requires life-long medication and treatment and is likely to be a danger both to himself and to others.
31        The medical opinion tendered by the defence acknowledges quite fairly that the question whether or not the accused here may commit murder again and whether he poses a danger to society is a difficult one to answer. Being of the view that the killing of the deceased was person-specific and the accused had no history of violence or suicide-homicidal behaviour, the Defence’s consultant psychiatrist opines that it is more likely than not that the accused is not prone to commit another murder and therefore more likely than not that he is not a danger to society.
32        In 
PP v Kwok Teng Soon
, it was argued that the 51-year-old accused there had felt cheated by his wife, whom he almost decapitated, and that the delusional state suffered by him was therefore person-specific. As he was already 51 years old, if sentenced to the lower tier of ten years’ imprisonment, it was not likely that he would be in a similar situation again with someone else upon his release. It was also said that the accused there was responding well to the prescribed medication and that the prognosis for his illness was good. I was not persuaded by the arguments there.
33        In the present case, I regret that I do not share the optimism of the Defence’s medical opinion. There is no telling whom the accused may next consider to be his “tormentor”. Even if he was justifiably angered by the deceased’s taunting and bullying in 2000, there was a period of two to three years when there was no contact at all between them before the killing. Yet something sinister was brewing in the accused’s mind even after this period of time. Who might be the next Kelvin (the deceased) whom he must kill to “prevent men and women from getting married”? This appears to me a very real risk and I do not think society should be made to bear this risk and that some parents in the near future should have to lose their son like Kelvin’s parents did.
34        The accused requires long-term medication and treatment. Will he keep his medical appointments and comply faithfully with the directions on medication given to him? He has defaulted at the Child Guidance Clinic before. I am heartened to hear that his family is concerned and supportive. If he is sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and is released after another six years or so, his father and his mother would be 69 and 61 years old respectively. His elder brother (by then 36 years old) would have his own life to lead and so would the accused’s twin brother (by then 26 years old). Together with his past behavioural problems, including being physically aggressive towards his parents, I am not at all confident that the accused will co-operate with those eager to help him recover and see him well and I doubt his parents will be in a position to control him effectively then.
35        The Court of Appeal in 
PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
 cautioned that life imprisonment for a young offender would be much more drastic in its effect than for an older one because it is incarceration for the remainder of one’s life, subject to the possibility of parole after twenty years. It is unusual for an offender in such a case to be as young as the accused here but the consequences of his acts are no less horrifying and devastating than those of older offenders.
36        Undoubtedly, the conditions spelt out in 
Neo Man Lee v PP
 are satisfied. I feel very sorry for the unfortunate condition the accused is in but the safety of society is paramount.
37        On this topic of safety of the public, I commend all the people who assisted in subduing the then knife-wielding and agitated accused at the shopping mall, especially Mr Ayasamy Paliniappan, Mr Kalidas s/o Rajendran, Mr Anandan s/o Palanisamy Manickam and Mr Imran bin Mawi. Their quick thinking and brave acts have averted what could have been a second disaster in the busy shopping centre on that public holiday last year.
38        For the reasons stated, I now sentence the accused, Mr Bernard Kok Weng Shang, to imprisonment for life with effect from the date of his arrest on 1 May 2004.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was a petition by the Public Prosecutor to set aside the respondent’s conviction, which was procured on the basis of a false identity that the respondent had assumed. I set aside the respondent’s conviction and sentence for the reasons given below.
The facts
2          The respondent, one Raja Izzuwin, was wanted by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) for being absent without leave. On 15 October 2004 at about 1.45am, during a routine police spot check at Duxton Road, the police asked the respondent for his particulars. In order to avoid detection, he assumed the identity of one “Shaifudin”. He provided the identity card number of “Shaifudin” verbally to the police, claiming he did not have his identity card in his possession.
3          Unknown to the respondent, the said “Shaifudin” was also wanted for a total of 12 parking-related summonses issued by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) and the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”). A screening with the Divisional Operations Room by the police of the particulars given by the respondent revealed that 12 warrants of arrest had been issued against “Shaifudin” for failing to turn up in court on various dates to answer to the summonses.
4          As a result, the respondent was placed under arrest and conveyed to the Central Police Division Headquarters, and an arrest report was lodged against him. The respondent maintained his assumed identity in the lock-up and provided the identity card number and residential address of “Shaifudin” to the Charge Office staff, who recorded the information in the Charge Book. The respondent was then searched, but no identification papers were found on him.
5          
At about 9.00am that same day, the respondent was produced in Court No 14 of the Subordinate Courts. The charges by the HDB and the URA against “Shaifudin” were read and explained to the respondent and he confirmed that he understood the same. The case was adjourned to 18 October 2004, when the respondent was again produced in Court No 14. The respondent admitted to the facts of the case without qualification and pleaded guilty to all 12 charges in the summonses. In mitigation, he pleaded for leniency on the basis that it was his first offence and both his parents had passed away. It was established that “Shaifudin’s” parents had indeed passed away.
6          
The respondent was accordingly sentenced to pay a fine of $7,200, with 36 days’ imprisonment in default. The respondent was unable to pay the fine and was thus ordered to serve the default sentence at the Queenstown Remand Prison (“QRP”), where his true identity was discovered on 10 November 2004 to be that of Raja Izzuwin. On 11 November 2004, the respondent was arrested at the QRP for the offence of being absent without leave under s 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42, 2001 Rev Ed).
7          
The respondent admitted that he had assumed the identity of his friend “Shaifudin” in order to avoid arrest, as he knew that he (Raja Izzuwin) was wanted by the SCDF. On 10 December 2004, the respondent pleaded guilty to the charge by the SCDF against him under s 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act and was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment. On 11 March 2005, the respondent also pleaded guilty to one charge of giving false information under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), and two charges of false personation under s 205 of the Penal Code. Ten other charges of false personation under s 205 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, and the respondent was sentenced to a total of four months and three weeks’ imprisonment for the charges under the Penal Code.
8          
The Public Prosecutor thus petitioned for the erroneous conviction recorded against the respondent in regard to the parking summonses to be set aside. At the time of the hearing before me, the respondent was serving his prison sentence for his own offence of being absent without leave, and the real “Shaifudin” was still at large.
Setting aside the conviction
9          The revisionary powers of the High Court are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”). Pursuant to s 266(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”):
The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court.
10        The High Court’s revisionary powers are to facilitate its supervisory and superintending jurisdiction over criminal proceedings before a subordinate court so as to correct, if necessary, a miscarriage of justice arising from any of the grounds stated in s 266 of the CPC: 
Koh Thian Huat v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 28
, 
Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 362
. In addition, under s 268(1) of the CPC, the court may exercise any of the powers conferred by ss 251, 255, 256 and 257 of the CPC, which include reversing a conviction passed by the lower courts.
11        The principles governing revision are well established, and it suffices to restate that in order to attract the exercise of the court’s revisionary jurisdiction, there must be serious injustice, or a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice: 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
.
12        
This court has in several cases found a failure of justice to exist where a person has been convicted “despite the obvious absence of an essential constituent of the offence concerned”: 
Ng Kim Han v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 293
 at [10], 
Abdul Aziz bin Ahtam v PP
 
[1997] 2 SLR 96
. For example, petitions for criminal revision have been allowed where the Statement of Facts did not disclose all the necessary elements of the offence: see 
Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing Pte Ltd v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 745
.
13        In the recent case of
 
Abdul Munaf bin Mohd Ismail v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 4
, the petitioner, charged as Kathar Abdul Gafoor, had admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts, which stated, 
inter alia
, that he was an Indian national who had entered Singapore unlawfully by passing himself off as one Malaysian named Abdul Munaf bin Mohd Ismail using a photo-substituted Malaysian restricted passport. The petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge under s
 
 
6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed) for entering Singapore without a valid pass and was convicted and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and fined $2,000. He paid the fine and was serving his term of imprisonment when he petitioned to set aside his conviction and sentence. He produced six other old passports bearing the name of Abdul Munaf and a
 
document which he said was his certificate of registration of citizenship in Malaysia.
 
On the evidence, Choo Han Teck J was satisfied that the petitioner was probably Abdul Munaf, and set aside the conviction and sentence of the petitioner
 
who was convicted in the name of Kathar Abdul Gafoor
.
14        The present case is most unusual and the first of its kind to come before this court
. The respondent had memorised “Shaifudin’s” particulars well and was even able to provide “Shaifudin’s” six-digit postal code to the police verbally. His mitigation plea
 was also consistent with “Shaifudin’s” family circumstances.
15        
It is not uncommon for people to try and evade detection or arrest by assuming a false or different identity
. However, due to the respondent’s convincing and well-executed charade, the respondent’s identity was not verified before he was produced in court to face the parking charges against “Shaifudin”.
 Nevertheless, to prevent the recurrence of a case such as the present one, proper measures ought to be taken in future to verify the identity of arrested and/or accused persons.
16        I found it mystifying as to why the respondent maintained his assumed identity and pleaded guilty to the parking offences despite the fact that they were not committed by him; presumably, the respondent chose to do so as the penalty for parking summonses was far less serious than that for being absent from duty without leave.
17        It is trite law that the fact that a petitioner pleaded guilty of his own accord is not a bar to the exercise of the court’s revisionary power. The fact that a plea of guilt has been entered means only that the accused loses his right to appeal against his conviction pursuant to s 244 of the CPC, and an application by way of criminal revision is the only means by which the accused can have a wrongful conviction set aside: 
Ng Kim Han v PP
 ([12], 
supra
).
18        In the circumstances of the present case, which led to the petition for revision being brought by the Public Prosecutor, the respondent’s plea of guilt clearly did not prevent the court from exercising its powers of revision. Since the respondent did not commit the parking offences, his plea of guilt was invalid.
19        
The correct identity of an accused is surely the paramount factor in the soundness of the conviction against him. Therefore, the conviction based on the mistaken identity of the respondent was fundamentally erroneous and amounted to a miscarriage of justice, whether or not the mistake was brought about by the respondent himself.
20        Accordingly, I set aside the respondent’s conviction and sentence for the 12 parking-related offences and summonses.

12 April 2005                                                                                                        
 
District Judge Aedit Abdullah:
1
         
 The Appellant was tried on three charges of criminal breach of trust.
 
 A fourth charge was withdrawn at the start of the trial, and a discharge amounting to an acquittal was recorded.
 
 The three charges proceeded with were originally for offences under s 408 Penal Code.
 
 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I amended the charges to those under s 406, and called for the Appellant’s defence.
 
 The Appellant declined to testify on her own behalf, or to call witnesses, and the trial closed only on the Prosecution’s evidence.
 
 After considering arguments from both sides, I amended the amounts involved in each of the charges.
 
 I then convicted the Appellant on two of the charges, DAC 14768 and 14769 of 2004, and acquitted her of one, DAC 14767 of 2004.
2          The Appellant was sentenced 3 months’ imprisonment and $10,000 fine (in default 2 months) on DAC 14768, and on DAC 14769 to 6 months’ imprisonment and $10,000 fine
 
(in default 2 months).  The sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently.  The total sentence was therefore 6 months’ imprisonment, and $20,000 fine, with 4 months’ imprisonment in default.
3          The Appellant appealed against her conviction and sentence.
The charges
4          DAC 14767 of 2004 read originally:
You, Lee Siew Eng Helen(female, aged 47 years old), NRIC 2164845J, are charged that you between 9 January 2002 and 24 January 2002, in Singapore, being the General Manger of Anthola Insurance Brokers (S) Pte Ltd (hereinafter Anthola) and in such capacity being entrusted with dominion over its property, namely the monies in its Insurance Broking Premium Account maintained with the Development Bank of Singapore (account no. 011-009996-6) did dishonestly dispose of that property in violation of Section 22(3) of the Insurance Intermediaries Act (Cap 142A), which is a direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, to wit, by withdrawing a total sum of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) for the purpose of paying Anthola's operational expenses and bank overdraft and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Revised Edition).
An annex to the charge listed the withdrawal dates and amounts.
5          DAC 14768 was in the same terms, in respect of an amount of $313,000 taken between 11 January 2001 and 27 December 2001; while DAC 14769 was for an amount of $532,000 between 10 January 2000 and 29 December 2000.  Each charge had its respective annex listing the withdrawal dates
 
and amounts.
6          The Insurance Intermediaries Act, which was in force between 2000 and 2002, required under s 22, an insurance broker to deposit money collected from clients into a designated account, the Insurance Broking Premium Account (IBPA). Funds could only be withdrawn from this account, inter alia, either to pay the insurers premiums due, or as the
 
commissions due to the broker from the money collected.
7          Section 22 read:
Insurance broking premium accounts
22.
 —(1) Every registered insurance broker shall establish and maintain a separate account with any bank licensed under the Banking Act (Cap. 19) for each type of registration.
(2) A registered insurance broker shall pay into each bank account maintained by it under subsection (1), all moneys received by it —
(a) from or on behalf of an insured or intending insured for or on account of an insurer in connection with a contract of insurance or proposed contract of insurance; or
(b) from or on behalf of an insurer for or on account of an insured or intending insured.
(3) A registered insurance broker shall not, except with the consent of the Authority, withdraw moneys from a bank account maintained by it under subsection (1) except —
(a) for payment to or for a person entitled to receive payment of the moneys, including itself in so far as it is entitled to receive payment for itself;
(b) for payment to or for an insurer in respect of amounts due to the insurer under or in relation to a contract of insurance (including a contract of insurance that has been cancelled);
(c) for investments in deposits placed with any bank licensed under the Banking Act or any other securities that may be prescribed; or
(d) for repayment of moneys that were paid into the account in error.
(4) A registered insurance broker shall pay moneys received from the realisation of any investment made under subsection (3) (
c
) into a bank account maintained by it under subsection (1).
(5) If, upon the realisation of any investment made under subsection (3) (
c
), the amount of moneys received in respect of the realisation is less than the amount of moneys invested, the registered insurance broker shall make good the shortfall.
(6) Interest or other income received by a registered insurance broker from a bank account maintained under subsection (1) or from any investment made under subsection (3) (
c
) may be retained by the insurance broker for its own benefit and need not be paid into, or retained in, a bank account maintained under subsection (1).
(7) A bank account maintained under subsection (1) and any investment made under subsection (3) (
c
) shall be called an “insurance broking premium account”, with or without other words of description.
(8) A lien or claim on the moneys in any insurance broking premium account shall be void unless the moneys in the account are for fees due and owing to the registered insurance broker.
(9) A charge or mortgage on the moneys in any insurance broking premium account shall be void.
The Prosecution’s Case
8          Up to the close of the Prosecution’s case, it was their position that the Appellant had committed criminal breach of trust as a servant, by withdrawing funds from the designated account established under the Insurance Intermediaries Act for the benefit of the insurance broking company, in excess of the commission to which the insurance broking company was entitled. 
9          The Appellant was the general manager of Anthola Insurance Broker (S) Pte Ltd.  Evidence was adduced that the Appellant was the person running the business on a daily basis.  The Appellant was alleged to have instructed and approved the withdrawal of funds out of the designated deposit account in contravention of s 22 of the Insurance Intermediaries Act, IIA, in that these funds were used for payment of various office expenses, instead of being used to pay the premiums of the clients, and these funds did not represent the commission earned by Anthola Insurance Brokers. 
10        To support these allegations, evidence was adduced from three persons who served as accounts personnel in 2000 to 2002.  The first of these was PW1, who could not remember when she started with Anthola, but served with Anthola up to about the end of 2000.  She testified that more money than the commission was taken out of the deposit account.  According to her, Anthola owed the insurers money, because the income of the company was not enough to cover the expenses.  The moneys withdrawn were used for office expenses. 
11        In cross-examination, PW1 was asked about who actually gave instructions within the company, and answered that she took her instructions from the Appellant.  PW1 agreed with the Appellant’s Counsel however that she was not able to identify specifically which transaction exceeded the entitlement.  I asked PW1 a number of questions relating to the instructions from the Appellant, to which the witness testified that she had raised the difficulties in paying premiums to the insurance companies. 
12        PW2, Wendy Leong, testified that she worked for Anthola for about 2 months, starting around December 2000.  She was unable however to recall anything material about her time there. 
13        PW3 Maureen Yap, joined Anthola in Feb 2001 and left in May 2003.  She testified that money was taken from the DBS account, the premium broking account, and that not more than the commission amount could be transferred from that account to the operating expenses account held at UOB.  She testified that Anthola owed the insurance companies money and the commission earned was sometimes less than the transferred amount.  PW3 also testified that Anthola underwent a change of name subsequently. 
14        In cross-examination.  PW3 was asked about the role of the Appellant in the company. She was also asked about the rate of commission which she agreed would vary in a range, but she could not remember the various rates.  As with PW1, she could not identify specific payments which were in excess of Anthola’s entitlement.   
15        The Prosecution also adduced the evidence of Richard Lim Soo Chiang, an accountant, PW4, who was Anthola’s auditor for the early 1990’s and 2001.  The audit for 2001 was actually carried out only in 2003.  Through this witness, the Prosecution adduced an audit report for 2001, prepared by the witness.  PW4 explained the report P9, and also referred to his working file for the audit.  The crux of his evidence was on the state of the accounts of Anthola.  While this witness also testified as to the audited accounts for 2000, the audit was not done by him but by another person, who had since passed away.  
16        The cross-examination of PW4 was primarily on the actual monies collected or in the hands of Anthola.  PW4 accepted that the amount actually collected by Anthola would not necessarily be reflected in the amounts in the accounts, and that money collected by Anthola could actually be for amounts due in previous years. 
17        The Prosecution also relied on the evidence of PW5 Grace Lui, who was the representative of Kemper Insurance, an insurer dealing with Anthola from 1998 to about July 2001.  She testified that premiums were owing from Anothola, which led Kemper to seek payments from the insurance clients directly.  However, some of these clients responded that they had in fact paid Anthola.  PW4 went through a number of these instances. 
18        In questioning by Appellant’s Counsel, the issue of the relationship between Anthola and Kemper was brought up.  PW4 accepted that whether or not a particular client had paid Anthola was not a concern of Kemper.  However in re-examination, PW4 testified further that when a policy is cancelled because of outstanding premium, Anthola would still owe the outstanding amount.
19        The other representative of an insurer was William Tay, PW6, who was the Executive Vice President for AXA Regional Finance, and previously the Chief Finance Officer for AXA Singapore.  He related that from 1997 to 1998, Anthola was slow in payment, and by 1999 AXA required Anthola to do business on a cash basis, and money had to be paid directly by the insured to AXA.  A scheme of arrangement was entered into with Anthola to deal with the money owed.     
20        In cross-examination, PW6 was asked at some length concerning Anthola's role, vis a vis the insurer.  PW6 was adamant that from his understanding of the law, Anthola would not be liable for unpaid premiums. 
21        The Prosecution rested on the evidence of these 6 witnesses.
Prima Facie Case
22        The Defence submitted that there was no case to answer.  It was argued that the Prosecution failed to show how any illegality had arisen in respect of each of the 54 payments specified in the charges, namely that each of these payments had exceeded Anthola’s entitlement at the point when they were made. 
23        The Prosecution for its part submitted that there was a case to answer as the elements of criminal breach of trust as a servant were made out through the evidence of the various witnesses.  It was argued that it was sufficiently shown that the sums were withdrawn in excess of the commission earned by Anthola.  The totality of the evidence supported this, and that under s 159 (2) CPC it was not necessary to show that a specific withdrawal was in excess of the entitlement. 
24        The Court noted these arguments, but was also concerned that aside from dishonest misappropriation or conversion, that it was appropriate for the Appellant to have been charged under s 408 Penal Code for Criminal Breach of Trust as a servant, rather than simple CBT under s 406 or some other charge.  Further arguments were invited from the parties on this point.
Further no-case submissions
25        In further no-case submissions, the Defence argued that s 408 was not made out.  It was pointed out that it was not in dispute that the Appellant had used the money not for her own benefit, or anyone else’s, but Anthola’s.  It was argued that there was unlawful gain to Anthola but not unlawful loss to Anthola.  The Defence repeated its arguments that the Prosecution had failed to show that the sums withdrawn, either individually, or as a whole were in excess of the entitlement under the commission.
26        The Prosecution in further arguments contended that there had been a loss suffered by Anthola of the premiums in the IBPA, because Anthola had been deprived of its use to pay the insurance companies, relying on 
Yeow Fook Yuen v R
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 80
, 
Goo Kian v PP
 
[1939] MLJ 293
 and 
Lee Yuen Hong
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
.
  In the alternative, it was argued that charges under s 409 read with s 109 (abetment by the Appellant of CBT as an agent by Anthola), simple CBT under s 406 or criminal misappropriation under s 403 were made out.
The decision of the Court on the prima facie case.
27        At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I had to consider whether the test laid out in s 180(f) of the CPC and elaborated in 
Haw Tua Tau
 
v PP
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 was met.  I was mindful that the Court was to:
.. decide whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the offence.  If the court so decides that each essential element in the alleged offence has been established he must call for the defence.  At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence.

Elements of the charge under s 408
28        Section 408 reads:
408.
 Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or employed as a clerk or servant, and being in any manner entrusted in such capacity with property, or with any dominion over property, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment ….
29        The elements that had to be established by the Prosecution in respect of a charge under s 408 were that:
(a)        the Accused was a clerk or servant, or employed as such;
(b)        the Accused was entrusted in such capacity with property or dominion over property;
(c)        the Accused committed criminal breach of trust in respect of that property.
30        For criminal breach of trust to be committed, the Accused must have dishonestly misappropriated or converted to his own use the property, or dishonestly used or disposed of that property in violation of any direction of law.  In the present case, the Prosecution’s original charges were that the Appellant had dishonestly disposed of that property in violation of the direction of law contained in the Insurance Intermediaries Act. 
31        The question then was whether the Appellant had committed dishonest use or disposal of property when she used funds in the IBPA, entrusted to her by the Company, for the benefit of the Company itself.  A contravention of the direction of the direction of law could not by itself give rise to an offence of criminal breach of trust.
32        Turning to the issue of whether the act of criminal breach of trust as a servant had been committed, what had to be determined was whether there was dishonest use or disposal.  A disposal would only be dishonest if it is done with the intention to cause wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another:  s 24 Penal Code.  Applying that in the context of a charge under s 408, for criminal breach of trust as a servant, the criminal breach of trust must involve a dishonest disposal of the property entrusted to the servant in that capacity.  The criminal act must result in wrongful loss or wrongful gain.   
33        It should also be noted that is not possible to speak sensibly of wrongful gain to the employer under s 408 charge since the property is entrusted by the employer in some way.  There can be no gain when the property was the Employer’s to entrust.
34        As for wrongful loss, this was possibly caused to the insured or the insurers, but while that may be pertinent in other forms of criminal breach of trust (such as a charge under s 406), that was not relevant to a charge under s 408.  Though it is not explicitly spelled out, s 408 does require that the loss be caused to the employer in some way.  This is clear from the requirement in s 408 that the accused be a servant of the employer, and that the property be entrusted to him in that capacity.  Loss to persons other than the employer is not relevant under s 408.   
35        That left the issue whether the actions of the Appellant caused wrongful loss to Anthola.  The Prosecution argued in their Further No-Case submissions that wrongful loss was caused to Anthola, as Anthola could not use the monies wrongfully taken out to pay the insurance companies the premiums due.  It was true that the money was not available to pay the insurance companies, but that was only because the money had been used to pay for Anthola’s own operating expenses.  There was still benefit to Anthola from the mis-use of the funds.  To take a perhaps simplistic example, but in the spirit of the illustrations in the Penal code, the Prosecution’s case on s 408 was akin to saying that a servant entrusted with wheat in the master’s warehouse could be charged for criminal breach of trust as a servant if she used the wheat, not to sell to others as intended, but to bake bread for the master and his family.  It is noteworthy here, that in comparison these difficulties do not arise in respect of s 406, since the wrongful loss there is not just restricted to the Employer or Master.
36        The Prosecution relied on the case of 
Yeow Fook Yuen v R
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 80
 as an illustration that deprivation of use of funds could amount to wrongful loss.  Certainly deprivation is a form of wrongful loss, but the example in 
Yeow Fook Kuen
 as well as the other cases cited by the Prosecution differ in a significant way from the present case.  There was in effect no deprivation of the use of the money since Anthola benefited directly and tangibly from the impugned criminal acts of the Appellant: she used or directed the use of the funds for Anthola’s benefit through enabling Anthola to pay off its expenses.
37        This chain of reasoning shows that there must be a nexus between the alleged criminal breach of trust and the position of the Appellant as a servant.  For a charge under s 408 to be made out, the Appellant must have committed criminal breach of trust qua servant vis a vis his or her master.  The misuse of funds which does not result in the deprivation of benefit to the Master or Employer of a servant, cannot amount to criminal breach of trust by that servant qua servant.  The mere fact that the Servant may have violated a direction as to the use of the funds, whether express or implied, does not give rise to criminal breach of trust.  Neither does it suffice that the Servant’s actions may have deprived the Master or Employer of one kind of benefit, where those actions confer some other benefit instead. 
38        On the facts as adduced by the Prosecution therefore, the Appellant did not commit criminal breach of trust as a servant.  While the Prosecution’s evidence at face value showed that the Appellant had taken or caused to be taken funds out of the IBPA, these funds were not sued for the benefit of the Appellant herself or another person.  It was not disputed that these funds were in fact used for the purposes of Anthola itself, namely its operating expenses. 
39        It should be noted that effectively s 408 was not contravened here as the direction of law was not one that governed the relationship between the Appellant and her Master or Employer.  It was instead a direction concerning the holding of funds by the insurance intermediaries for the benefit of the clients or the insurers.  A contravention of that direction of law would not necessarily result in a breach of trust in the context of the relationship between the servant and the employer. 
40        The use of such funds, could, from Anthola’s point of view, have been in breach of internal guidelines or good practice. But it could not vis-à-vis Anthola have amounted to criminal breach of trust as a servant.  While it perhaps cannot be stated conclusively, it is likely that there will be few instances where s 408 is made out in a situation where the direction of law does not form part of the relationship between the employer and the servant.
41        Finally I note that the Prosecution referred to 
Lee Yuen Hong
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
, it was emphasised that a temporary deprivation too could give rise to dishonesty.  But this does not assist at all in the present case. 
Whether the defence should be called
42        As for Counsel’s arguments that no prima facie case was made out that there was any misappropriation since the Prosecution could not point to any specific withdrawal being in excess of entitlement, I was of the view that at this stage in the proceedings, it was at the very least, a reasonable inference from the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses that there was misappropriation of the sums in that there had been a violation of the direction of law that nothing beyond the specified withdrawals under s 22(3) of the IAA.  Despite the arguments of the Defence, I was of the view that criminal misappropriation or breach of trust had been shown to the appropriate standard.  
Amendment of charges at close of prosecution’s case.
43        As I concluded that the charges under s 408 were not made out, it then remained to consider whether the defence should be called at all,, or whether the charges should be amended so that they were sustained by the Prosecution’s evidence.
44        The Prosecution submitted a number of alternative charges.  It sufficed for me to consider the highest charge, that is the most serious, that could be maintained by the evidence adduced by the Prosecution.  The Court could not to my mind amend to the lowest possible charge sustainable, ignoring other charges made out, as this would be tantamount to assuming prosecutorial discretion.
45        The severest alternative put forward by the Prosecution was for the charges to cover abetment of criminal breach of trust by an agent under s 409 CPC.  For this to be made out as a prima facie case, however, it had to be shown that the Appellant had abetted criminal breach of trust by Anthola.  Certainly, it is not necessary for the principal to commit an offence, see for instance s 115 Penal Code, but the Appellant must have intended to abet the commission of the offence of CBT as an agent.  I did not find that the Prosecution’s case supported such charges.  The Prosecution should have adduced evidence to show that the Appellant acted to do so, but there was no such evidence.  It was also significant in this regard that there was no evidence from the directors of Anthola, nor did any of the Prosecution witnesses give evidence that there was any policy by Anthola, as a corporation, to commit criminal breach of trust.  The absence of such evidence militated against a conclusion, even on a prima facie basis, that the Appellant had intended to abet criminal breach of trust by Anthola, regardless whether Anthola did or did not itself commit criminal breach of trust. 
46        In comparison, a charge under s 406 for simple criminal breach of trust was prima facie supported by the Prosecution’s evidence under the test in 
Haw Tua Tau
.  The evidence was that there was money in the dominion of the Appellant, which was subject to a direction of law.  The evidence from the Prosecution witnesses showed that these monies were withdrawn from the trust account, and transferred to the current account, upon the direction of the Appellant.  At this stage of the proceedings, I could not accept that the inferences to be drawn from the prosecution’s evidence did not lead to the conclusion that there was a prima facie case against the accused.
47        In view of my conclusion that the Prosecution’s case supported charges under s 406, it was not necessary for me to consider whether offences under s 403 were made out, though it is noted that that a similar conclusion was likely. 
48        I amended the three charges accordingly to offences under s 406, and called the Appellant to elect whether to give evidence or remain silent.
49        The Appellant chose not to give evidence, and did not call any witnesses.  Counsel did consider an application to recall one of the witnesses, PW4, but after consideration, did not press the application.  I was of the view that based on what Counsel informed the Court that the evidence sought need not come from PW4: it appeared that the questions were to be concerned with funds not being by Kemper. PW4 would not have known this himself, as he was not part of Anthola but was only its auditor.  I then left it to counsel to consider calling his own witness. In the event, this was not done because of the Appellant’s election.  For completeness, I should also state that I was also minded to rule that there was no right to recall that witness PW4 following the amendment of the charges at that point as the reasons for recalling did not arise out of those amendments. 
The Close of trial
50        As the Appellant chose not to give evidence and did not have any witnesses on her part, the Court had to decide based on the Prosecution’s evidence, and the submissions of both sides.  I was mindful that the burden lay on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Prosecution’s case at the close of trial
51        The Prosecution’s submissions at the close of trial was largely similar to those made at the end of its case. 
52        The effect of s 22(3) of the Insurance Intermediaries Act was that the insurance brokers were not allowed to touch the net premiums for their own purposes; that is withdrawals from the IBPA could be made only  to either pay the premiums or the commissions due.  This was a direction of law which was violated by the Appellant knowingly instructing and authorising the transfer of monies from the IBPA to its operating account in excess of the commission entitled.
53        It was argued that the sums withdrawn were in excess of the commission earned.  PW1’s evidence was that the withdrawals were in excess when she was there.  Premiums were not forwarded to the insurers, and instead used through Anthola’s operating account.  She gave evidence of the insurance companies chasing for premiums not paid, that the Appellant would settle the outstanding sum if it was small, and that there were times when there were simply insufficient funds to pay.  Commissions were also withheld by the insurers. 
54        PW3, who was with Anthola from February 2001 to May 2003, had testified as well that Anthola was transferring monies in excess of the commission earned, as reflected in the reconciliation statements. 
55        PW4, the auditor for 2001, testified that in 2001, $288,972 was booked as commission, but the commission actually received was less.  The Prosecution argued that based on the aging list in P10, a sum of $457,116.51 had not been collected for 2001, though it was booked.  Assuming 15% commission, $60,000 worth of commission was not collected.  And in fact the amount booked and uncollected was higher as shown by P10.  The sums owed by trade debtors also show a significant amount of premiums booked but not collected.  At the same time, Anthola did not receive significant extra commission, or production allowance, for hitting sales targets.  In fact PW4 testified that Kemper had set off the production allowance earned by Anthola against amounts owed to Kemper. 
56        The maximum commission booked by Anthola for 2000 and 2001 were $397,704 and $288,972, which represented the maximum amount that Anthola could withdraw from IBPA.  However, Anthola collected less in premiums, and therefore the amount that could have been drawn was lower.  By transferring sums of $532,000 and $313,000 for these years, the direction of law under s 22(3) was breached.
57        Evidence from PW5 showed that sums were owing to Kemper, which eventually led to cancellation of some policies.  PW5 testified that Kemper had chased Anthola for payment of premiums owing. 
58        PW6, the CFO of AXA, testified that AXA was owed premiums 
59        The Prosecution submitted that the evidence from the various prosecution  witnesses showed that transfers were in excess of the commission entitled.  The audited accounts also showed that the maximum commission for 2000 and 2001 were far less than the amounts withdrawn, which showed the maximum possible commission fell below the amounts transferred out.  P12 was also corroboration that Anthola had collected premiums from certain clients but did not forward the nett premiums to the insurance company.
60        The evidence of the representatives of the insurance companies supported the conclusion that premiums were being used for office expenses, as the insurance companies could not collect the nett premiums due to them. 
61        An adverse inference should also be drawn against the Appellant for not giving evidence in her own defence.  It was submitted on the authority of 
Oh Laye Koh v PP
 
[1994] SGCA 102
 and 
Quak Siew Hock David v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 533
, that the Court could draw such an adverse inference when the prosecution’s evidence called for an explanation.  The Prosecution also referred to the statement of the Court of Appeal in 
Chia Chien Wen Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
, that guilt invokes the privilege of silence.  Prosecution relied as well on 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
[1993] 3 SLR 261
, that silence in the face of hard evidence sufficient to constitute a prima facie case inevitably leads to the result that the charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
62        The Prosecution argued that in the present case, the credibility of the prosecution witnesses was not in dispute, and no issue of choosing between the evidence of the witnesses arose.
63        The evidence showed, it was contended, that there was no reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the transfers of money out of the IBPA account to the operating expenses account were in excess of the entitled commission.  PW1 and PW3 testified to this effect.  Furthermore given that the insurance companies were constantly chasing Anthola for payment of the premiums, the Appellant must clearly have known that the premiums were being used for office expenses.  Her refusal to give evidence showed that it would not have been different from PW1’s evidence.  She had also not given evidence contradicting PW1’s testimony that  upon her telling the Appellant of the excess over commission, the Appellant had told PW1 that the use of money in excess of the entitled commission was needed to keep Anthola running.  Nor was it even put to PW1 that she had not in fact told the Appellant of this.  
64        As to the quantum transferred in excess, the Prosecution accepted that the exact figure could not be ascertained by calculation by any of the witnesses.  However, the Prosecution argued that it could establish the lowest possible amount which was the subject of the offences.  The basis of this was to take the amounts transferred, and compare it with the maximum possible commission earned for each of the respective years.  This would show the lowest possible amounts taken.  However, the prosecution argued that based on the aging lists, collected commissions were in fact lower than the booked commissions.  While there were no audited accounts which would help for 2002, PW6 testified that $11,000 was withheld by AXA from Anthola, and this gives the appropriate quantum for the charge for that year of $19,000.
The Defence case
65        The defence agued that the Prosecution had failed to prove its case.  The prosecution witnesses were not able to pin point specific payments in excess.
66        The defence took issue with the Prosecution’s calculation of the sums that were taken.  It was argued that the Prosecution’s assumptions were wrong or mere conjecture as there was no correlation between the amounts withdrawn for payment of commission and the amount booked for the period.  This was because the withdrawn amount included sums entitled for commissions earned during the  preceding year or years.  The commission actually received by Anthola in each year would be more than what the Prosecution alleged.  In support of this, the Defence pointed to the fact that commissions would be collected at least 3 months after they were initially booked.  The defence also argued that the Prosecution did not establish that the commission was indeed at an average of 15%. 
67        The Prosecution had failed to show that the withdrawals were in excess of the entitlement.  It was pointed out that the Prosecution witnesses did not dispute that on occasion, the commission rate could be as high as 60%.  As for the aging list, this was static, and showed the position only as of December 31 of the year in question. 
68        The prosecution’s position also failed because it did not take into account that amounts paid after December 31 would not be reflected.  In the circumstances, the figures that the Prosecution argued were in excess could not be relied upon. 
69        It was further argued that in respect of 2002, the Prosecution concluded that a sum of $11,000 owing from AXA to Anthola should be credited for that year.  The Prosecution however did not show how the amount for that year was in fact misappropriated, and how the withdrawals could be related to the sum owing. 
70        The Prosecution, it was argued, failed to prove its case on the facts, and relied only on suppositions.
The Decision
71        In view of the silence of the Appellant, before convicting her, I had to consider the totality of the prosecution witnesses’ evidence, as tested in Court, and inferences drawn from the silence, and whether these established the guilt of the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt:  
Oh Lay Koh
 .  Additionally, as noted in 
R Yoganathan v PP
 
[1999] SGHC 241
 once the Prosecution had proven a prima facie case, the evidential burden then shifts to the accused, to adduce evidence in support of his innocence.  This did not happen in the present case.
The effect of not giving evidence
72        Section 196 of the Criminal Procedure Code lays out the consequences where an accused person chooses not to give evidence on his own behalf:
(2)        If the accused –
(a)        after being called upon by the court to give evidence … refuses to be sworn or affirmed ….
  the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.
The Prosecution argued that in not giving evidence an adverse inference should be drawn against the Appellant.
73        The Defence was content to take the risk of challenging the Prosecution’s evidence alone, without adducing evidence of its own.  This meant that the Court did not have evidence of the Appellant’s version of events.  Her own version was not put forward.  No contradictory version was in fact adduced in evidence. There was in particular, no explanation by the Appellant of her own actions, inaction or intentions.  All that could be surmised of her version was from the puts made to the various prosecution witnesses, and puts by themselves are not evidence. 
74        In the circumstances, it was clear that adverse inferences had to be drawn against the Appellant for her failure to give evidence and to call witnesses on her behalf.  In particular, these inferences would concern her knowledge of the withdrawals from the IBPA, and, a disregard, at the every least, whether these withdrawals were or were not in excess of the sums permitted under s 22(3) IIA. 
75        Additionally, as stated by the Honourable the Chief Justice in 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
[1993] 3 SGHC 119
:
If, apart from the disputed facts and the credibility of the witnesses, there is hard evidence, whether in the shape of documents or photographs of what are known as ‘silent facts’, which is itself sufficient to constitute a prima facie case on the charge, the accused cannot choose to remain silent when called upon.  If he does remain silent, the unavoidable result is that the case would then have been effectively proved against him beyond reasonable doubt by default.
76        In the present case, I found that the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses (aside from PW2, who as it was did not recall much) was clear and was not shaken at all in the cross-examination by Appellant’s counsel.  Having heard their evidence, I found that their evidence was cogent, and credible.  In the absence of any contrary evidence adduced by the Appellant, and in the absence of any doubt caused by the cross-examination, I found that the Prosecution’s evidence should be accepted.  
77        Additionally, there was also the documentary evidence in the form of the accounts of the broker, adduced through PW4, showing the state of the accounts, the amount of commission booked for each year and the withdrawals made within the year. 
78        Thus while the burden lay on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the failure of the Appellant to proffer any explanation led to the inference that there was no explanation that could be made.  That then raised the question whether the withdrawals were in fact made without any authorisation under s 22.
The effect of the withdrawals
79        The crux of the defence then was that legally, the evidence of the Prosecution did not establish the commission of the offences alleged. It was argued, both at the close of the Prosecution’s case and at the close of trial, that the Prosecution failed to correlate each withdrawal with the entitlement of Anthola to its commission.  That is, the Prosecution had to show misappropriation, it was argued by the Appellant’s counsel, through specific withdrawals being in excess of entitlement. 
80        I rejected this argument.  A criminal breach of trust in violation of a direction of law is the use of the funds without regard to such direction as specified under s 22 IIA.  Section 405 defines criminal breach of trust, in its relevant aspects, as follows:
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, …. dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged … commits ‘criminal breach of trust’. 
Section 22 limits withdrawals to a number of specified purposes.  Withdrawals  for the benefit of the broker are limited to those for commission, as being payment to which it was entitled to receive for itself under s 22(3)(a).
81        Given that the purpose of s 22 is to ensure the separation of funds of insured persons from those of  the broker, and given the restrictions contained in s 22(3), it was to my mind necessary that each withdrawal be linked directly to a particular sum deposited. That is, a withdrawal as commission due to a broker in respect of a specific client could only be made if moneys had actually been deposited in to the account as premium paid by that client.  Under the scheme of s 22, as I interpreted it, no money could be withdrawn as money due to the broker from that client if the whole of that money had in fact been used for other purposes, such as payment to the insurer or invested under s 22(3)(c).  This approach goes to some extent against the fungibility of money, but I could not see how else s 22 could function as effective guard against the unauthorised use of funds in the insurance broking premium account, particularly as the money would come from different clients.  If this approach were not taken, it would permit the withdrawal of Peter’s money, for instance, to pay Paul’s premium, and that went against the control over the use of funds contained in s 22.  Certainly, the approach as interpreted here requires rigorous and detailed accounting, but to my mind, that was part of the intent of the section.
82        Therefore, s 22 was not merely contravened when there is a withdrawal in excess of entitlement. Section 22 required that each withdrawal was in fact authorised in one of the ways listed under s 22(3), and that each withdrawal, for commission for instance, was for a commission earned in respect of a sum already deposited in respect of a specific client.  The Prosecution showed that these withdrawals were not in fact authorised, since the withdrawals of specific sums of money was not correlated to specific deposits made by particular clients. 
83        It was clear from the evidence of PW1 and PW3 that the withdrawal of sums had no correlation to the deposits made by specific clients.  PW1 testified:
Anthola took out more money then commission.  For example, client paid premium, so we did not pay to insurance company.  And if you check monthly accounts, if the client had paid this is reflected in the ledger, but the insurance company money still outstanding in the statement of accounts from the insurance company.  The other thing is by looking at the accounts.  For example at this time, we had a profit of $10k, that is our commission entitlement, but we would withdraw 30k to cover operating expenses.  Sometimes clients can pay direct to the insurance company; the insurance company will not pay back the entitlement to Anthola.  Our entitlement meaning the commission entitlement.  It was not paid because we owe them more than what we are entitled to get, so they hold the entitlement to contra against the outstanding. 
84        The witnesses did state that they could not point to any single withdrawal being in excess of entitlement, but they remained constant that the withdrawals were made without regard to the restrictions in s 22, particularly, that they were not the amounts representing the commission earned.  PW1 testified in cross-examination [NE 20C – 21A]: 
Q:         Look through this stack of payments, 26 pages, all the remaining vouchers, are you able to point out which of these payments exactly which ones you are very sure that Anthola not entitled ?
A:         I am not able to because it’s one by one. I won’t be able to identify which ones Anthola were not entitled to.
Q:         The entire stack in P6, to the UOB account as indicated in the vouchers, not able to point to a single one of them as being Anthola not being entitled to.
A:         I can’t, because I can’t remember.
Q:         It is not just that you can’t remember, did you ever point out to anyone at any point in time any of these particular payments which were clearly identified as Anthola not being entitled to?
A:         Helen is aware. I pointed out to Helen. But I can’t identify which voucher. Overall she’s aware about the case.
85        In re-examination, she reiterated [at NE 24B]:
I had testified that I pointed out to Helen.  When I told her, she said she’s aware, but she said we had no choice.  We can’t deny paying the staff. We had no choice but to temporarily take the money or whatever
.
86        PW3’s evidence was similar [at NE36C - 37B]:
I just know that we should keep this broking account and bank in clients monies when they pay, and forward to insurance companies when due.  We are not allowed to transfer more than what was required to UOB account.  
By this I mean, when we receive $1000, suppose we earn 20% commission, we cannot transfer more than 20% out.  During my time in Anthola, Anthola had not kept to this restriction. 
I say this because, every month we have to transfer out to UOB account to pay staff salaries and other like CPF, other operating expenses.  During these monthly transfers, the restriction was breached on the premium broking account, we owed the insurance companies quite a lot of money and we didn’t pay them.  Anthola did not pay them because there were not enough funds in the bank.
There were not enough funds in the bank to pay the insurance companies, because we owed the insurance companies more than 2 million, I think.  So we always pay the staff salary first.  Only when the insurance companies called and chased payment then we would pay them.
I say Anthola had broken this restriction because Anthola for example had transferred $20k to $30k to UOB bank.  The transfer of 30k was a breach of the restriction because the commission earned is less than the amount transferred out.  I know the commission earned was less than the transferred amount, because every month there is a reconciliation statement to be done.  To reconcile the insurance company’s statement of accounts.  To see how much we actually owe them. 
87        PW3 then continued later [at 37D]:
I know the transfer is more than the commission earned, because in the reconciliation statement there would be a column showing how much the client paid, and what is the nett amount payable to the insurance company.  I can’t remember the commission rate.  The reconciliation statement will show me the transfer is more than the commission earned.  Based on calculation.  Based on a percentage.  Before a transfer is made, I would prepare a payment voucher.
88        PW3’s evidence was  not shaken by the relevant cross-examination [NE 47B – 47E]:
Q:         P8 PVs.  Able to tell level of entitlement by Anthola at time of payment or transfer from DBS to UOB?
A:         No.
Q:         If so, since unable to tell us what Anthola’s entitlement was, at the time of each of these payments, you will not be able to tell us which if any of these 24 payments in P8 had breached or was in breach of the restriction.
A:         I can’t tell.
Q:         You can’t even tell if any one of these 24 payments was in breach of the restriction.
A:         This is a round figure, 20k, it may or may not exceed.
Put:      Not relying on speculation, of the 24 transactions you are not able to identify which one of these is a payment in breach of restriction.
A:         I can’t identify.
89        While PW3 did testify that she did not know for certain if the Appellant knew of the transfers in excess, she also further testified in re-examination that the Appellant
 
was the person in charge of Anthola. 
90        PW3 had thus testified that the Appellant had not cared whether any of these withdrawals were in fact authorised under s 22.  She remained unshaken in this testimony, though she could not tell by the time of the trial, which payments had exceeded Anthola’s entitlement.
91        The evidence of these witnesses thus showed that the withdrawals were made without regard to the restrictions on withdrawal under s 22(3).  Additionally, the clear inference from PW1 and PW3’s evidence was that these transactions were done at the direction of the Appellant, since she was the one in charge of Anthola, and approved the transfers.  An explanation was required.  Had the Appellant testified as to her knowledge or approval, this conclusion could have been averted, but she did not, and an inference was drawn against her on this point.
Adverse inference of contravention of s 22(3)
92        Aside from my interpretation of s 22(3) that there had to be a correlation between withdrawal and deposit, there was also the other ground that given the evidence of the witnesses above, the failure by the Appellant to merely adduce any evidence to the contrary, such as even a bare denial by her on the stand, was telling, and justified an inference that these withdrawals were indeed made in contravention of s 22(3) as being in excess of the entitlement by Anthola.
93        It has already been noted that the Appellant failed to adduce any evidence as to her knowledge and intention as to the use of the funds in the IBPA.  In addition, the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, PW1 and PW3, showed that there was no assessment by her whether the funds withdrawn were actually Anthola’s entitlement.  Her silence in the face of this evidence meant that there was no explanation by her as to a crucial point.  Had she given testimony there would at least have been something before me.  As it was there was nothing.
94        Counsel was content to argue simply that there was no evidence adduced by the Prosecution of excess of entitlement for each and every withdrawal.  It was true that the Prosecution witnesses could not supply this.  But the Appellant’s silence in the face of the Prosecution’s version meant that there was no explanation for what went on, and whether these withdrawals were indeed in excess.  The inference that had to be drawn in this silence then was that the withdrawals were indeed in excess.
Misappropriation on an aggregate basis
95        Also aside from my interpretation of s 22(3) that there must be correlation between withdrawal and deposit, I also concluded that given that most transactions are done not on a cash basis but on an accrual basis, requiring that misappropriation be established only by a particular withdrawal being in excess of a particular entitlement would create too much of an opportunity for funds to be used in disregard of the direction of law.  It is to my mind sufficient for a charge of criminal breach of trust to made out that the misappropriation be shown on an aggregate basis rather than on the basis that a particular withdrawal was beyond what was entitled.  For one, as pointed out by the defence itself, premiums would be subject to a credit period, which means that the funds need not be paid in immediately, but only before the expiry of the relevant credit period.     
96        Section 159 (2) CPC, referred to by the Prosecution, permits the specifying of a gross sum for an offence, rather than separate sums for each instance of criminal breach of trust:
When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed without specifying particular items … and the charges so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence.
97        This does permit aggregation of instances, but the section is in the end only concerned with a sufficiency of a charge, rather than whether the charge is in fact established at law.  This section does not therefore, to my mind, assist all that much, though it does at least indicate that aggregation is contemplated by the legislature.
The amounts misappropriated
98        From the above, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been criminal breach of trust under s 406 for each of the three years.  However, it was necessary to identify the amount taken under each charge.  Here, I was mindful that the Prosecution’s burden was still to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  
99        The Prosecution proceeded on the basis, at the close of the trial, of calculating the lowest possible amounts taken in excess.  The Prosecution looked to the booked commission for each year.  The Defence argued that this approach ignored the fact that commissions may only be collected much later.  However taking into account the aging lists, which show the premiums not collected, it is evident that any commissions not collected could not be more than the premiums not collected either.  Taking this together with the adverse inference against the Appellant for not testifying, as well as burden that lay upon her to adduce evidence against the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied at the end of the day, that there was no reasonable doubt that after calculating the lowest possible mathematically amount would be the amount of money misappropriated beyond a reasonable doubt. 
100      It was not sufficient for the defence to point to the possibility that some commissions would only be collected much later, possibly years after.  Should this be the case, and no evidence was adduced by the Appellant in her silence, then a similar situation would arise in respect of the commissions earned in 2000 and 2001.  As pointed out by the Prosecution, it was the booked commission that was deducted in deriving the lowest possible sum.  Some of that booked commission could potentially be only collected later.  Therefore taking the booked commission as the earned commission would already give the accused the benefit of the doubt. 
101      In any event, the mere possibility of a commission being collected at some other point in time was not sufficient in the circumstances to raise a reasonable doubt.  The Prosecution was not required to prove its case beyond all doubt and all possibility.
Charges amended at the close of trial
102      Having heard the arguments from both sides, I was of the view that the quantum specified in the charges were not made out at all, and the amounts should be reduced to the lowest possible amounts for each year, as conceded by Prosecution.
103      Therefore the 3 charges were amended as follows:  The
 
1st charge: 19,000; the 2
nd
 charge: $24,028 and the 3
rd
 charge, $134,296.  The Appellant confirmed that she still wished to claim trial to these amended charges.
The decision of the Court on the charges
104      From the above, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had committed simple criminal breach of trust as alleged in the second and third charges.
105      However, I concluded that it was unsafe to convict the Appellant on the 1
st
 charge, covering 2002.  The difficulty with this charge was that there were, firstly, no audited accounts for that year, and there was no evidence of any booked commission for that year.  The only evidence of commission was that $11,000 had been withheld from AXA from Anthola,   which was the basis for the reduction of the subject matter of the charge to $19,000, instead of $30,000 as originally alleged. 
106      From the reasoning I had adopted above, there was to my mind sufficient evidence to show criminal breach of trust continuing into 2002.  But in the absence of any evidence as to what the highest possible commission could be, I could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that there was criminal breach of trust of that $19,000 or of any particular sum.  I could not on the evidence before me, assign any amount of money to the criminal breach of trust charge for that year.  In the circumstances therefore, the only recourse was to acquit the Appellant on this charge.  
Anthola’s status
107      Before I gave my decision, a point was raised by Counsel concerning whether Anthola was a registered insurance broker, subject to regulation under the IIA, and when this occurred, as this would clearly have an impact on the charges.  Prosecution’s position was that it was in any event not disputed. But since the Defence sought to clarify this, and both parties were amenable to an adjournment to determine the matter, I adjourned, to allow the Prosecution to determine Anthola’s status. 
108      As it was, the gazette notification was accordingly adduced, and marked and admitted as P16.  This discloses that Anthola was registered as an insurance broker with effect from 30 June 2000.  Additionally, as pointed out by the Prosecution, s 42 of the Insurance Intermediaries Act, which was a transition provision, stipulated, that an insurance broker would be deemed as a registered insurance broker if immediately before 31
st
 Dec 1999 it had been carrying on as insurance broker.  The evidence of the witnesses, particularly PW1, and to a lesser extent PW5 and PW6, showed that Anthola was in the business of insurance brokerage before that date.  Therefore Anthola was deemed to be a registered insurance broker from 31 Dec 1999 and was such a broker in fact from the date specified in the gazette notification.  The issue of Anthola’s status was therefore not a live one.  
Sentencing.
Mitigation.
109      Oral mitigation was made by Counsel for the Appellant.  He referred to the fact that she was a first offender.  He emphasised that the Appellant was not the decision maker, and only assisted in the management of the company.  He described her criminal acts as technical breaches, and noted in particular that the Appellant had not pocketed the funds.  He said that the Appellant
 
acted on her management’s decision and transferred the funds to the company’s account, for the payment of the company’s legitimate expenses. 
110      Counsel also noted that the Act was short-lived, and that there was no specific punishment provided for the breach of s 22.  He also referred to fact that
 
he Appellant had also cooperated in the investigations.
111      He urged leniency and the imposition of a fine.
Prosecution’s submissions
112      The Prosecution did not submit on sentence but raised the point that after the Insurance Intermediaries Act was repealed and replaced by Financial Advisors’ Act, similar provisions exist in that Act and under the offence provision, s 32, it is provided that a maximum fine of $100,000 may be imposed. No term of imprisonment is specified by the legislation. 
Sentence passed
113      In passing sentence, I took note of the punishment prescribed under the Financial Advisors Act.  While a high maximum fine is specified, no term of imprisonment is laid down.  That indicates Parliament’s intention as to the degree of seriousness of charges under that Act. 
114      However, the charges here were under the Penal Code, and the maximum fine that could be imposed by me on each charge was $10,000.  In view of the amounts involved, even a maximum fine on each charge of $10,000 alone was not adequate at all.  Some term of imprisonment was therefore required in addition to the fine. 
115      In determining the duration of the sentence of imprisonment, I took note of the strong mitigatory factor here that the accused did not benefit herself, and used the funds for the company.  I also noted that I am now sentencing after trial, albeit one that was not prolonged, given the position taken by the defence.   
116      Accordingly, I sentenced the accused on the second charge to 3 months’ imprisonment and $10,000 fine, in default 2 months’ imprisonment, and on the third charge, to 6 months’ imprisonment and $10,000 fine, 2 months’ imprisonment in default.  The sentences of imprisonment were to run concurrently, giving a  total of 6 months’ imprisonment, and $20,000 fine, with 4 months’ imprisonment in default. 
117      Bail was extended pending appeal.",2005-04-12 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge See Kee Oon:
The charges
1
         
 The accused was initially charged on 15 October 2004 with four counts in respect of separate Penal Code (Cap 224) offences.
 
 These were for offences of rioting (s 147) in DAC 46371/2004, criminal intimidation (s 506) in DAC 46372/2004, theft in dwelling (s 380) in DAC 46373/2004 and dishonest receipt of stolen property (s 411) in DAC 46374/2004.
 
 On 30 March 2005, he pleaded guilty before me to two out of these four counts, for offences of rioting and theft in dwelling respectively.
 
 The amended first charge (DAC 46371/2004) which he pleaded guilty to averred as follows:
You, Mukhantan s/o Perumal, Male/21 years old, NRIC: S8327073Z, Nationality: Singaporean, are charged that you, on the 22
nd
 day of May 2003, at or about 3.30 pm, at the hut beside Blk 292 Bishan St 24, Singapore, together with Ragumaran s/o Davindran, Easudas Jason, Afzal Ahmed s/o Mohamed Meeran, Vimal s/o Alagappasamy and two unknown persons were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Franklin Samuel Raj s/o Dawson, in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly, one or more of you did cause hurt to the said Franklin Samuel Raj s/o Dawson, to wit, by punching and kicking [him], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
2
         
 The accused also pleaded guilty to the amended third charge (DAC 46372/2004) which stated thus:
You, Mukhantan s/o Perumal, Male/21 years old, NRIC: S8327073Z, are charged that you, on the 13
th
 day of May 2003, at or about 1.45 pm, at Bishan NTUC Fairprice, Bishan Junction 8, 9 Bishan Place, Singapore, which is a building used for the custody of property, together with an unknown person and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit theft of 2 bottles of ‘Barcadi’, with total value of S$10.28, in the possession of one Ong Ying Khaim, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 read [with] Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
3
         
 I sentenced him to 18 months’ and two months’ imprisonment respectively, with the sentences running concurrently.
 
 The other two charges were taken into consideration with his consent for the purpose of sentencing.
 
 In the amended second charge (DAC 46372/2004), he admitted acting together with Easudas Jason in furtherance of their common intention to commit criminal intimidation by threatening Franklin Samuel s/o Raj Dawson on 22 May 2003, at or about 3.45 pm, in Tamil that they would kill his family.
 
 In the amended fourth charge (DAC 46374/2004), he admitted dishonestly receiving a ‘Nokia’ handphone valued at $100, being stolen property belonging to Naavasiva s/o Ramasamy, from Afzal Ahmed s/o Mohamed Meeran.
The statement of facts
4
         
 The accused admitted the statement of facts without qualification.
 
 The statement of facts revealed that the accused bore a grudge against Franklin Samuel s/o Raj Dawson (‘the victim’).
 
 The victim was at Bishan bus interchange on 22 May 2003 some time after noon when he was confronted by the accused, Ragumaran s/o Davindran (‘Ragumaran’), Afzal Ahmed s/o Mohamed Meeran (‘Afzal’), Vimal s/o Alagappasamy (‘Vimal’) and one of the unknown accomplices.
 
 The victim ignored them and boarded a bus.
 
 However, the accused followed the victim up the bus.
 
 Ragumaran, Afzal, Vimal and the unknown accomplice followed.
5
         
 On the bus, the accused and his four accomplices surrounded the victim where he was seated.
 
 The accused called Easudas Jason (‘Jason’) and told him that he had someone for him.
 
 Upon hearing this, Jason told the accused to bring the victim to meet him at a hut beside Block 292 Bishan Street 24.
 
 The victim was then told that one of the group’s ‘brothers’ wanted to talk to him.
 
 Afzal snatched the victim’s handphone from him.
 
 Out of fear, the victim later alighted with the group at a bus stop and boarded another bus from across the road.
 
 They headed to Block 292 Bishan Street 24 where they brought the victim to a nearby hut.
6
         
 At the hut, the group took away the victim’s wallet and noted his particulars as stated on his identity card.
 
 Thereafter they returned him the wallet. 
 
 The victim later noticed that a $50 note had gone missing from his wallet.
 
 Some time later, at about 3.30 pm, Jason arrived at the hut in a wheel-chair with the other unknown male Indian accomplice.
 
 Jason was wheel-chair bound due to an attack on him by persons believed to be members of the ‘Ang Soon Tong’ secret society.
 
7
         
 Jason had been told that the victim was an ‘Ang Soon Tong’ member.
 
 He punched the victim several times and caused him to fall to the ground.
 
 Members of the accused person’s group then kicked the victim several times in the head.
 
 The victim was again punched and kicked over another two instances.
 
 The group also made the victim eat cigarette ashes and a lit cigarette.
 
 They then forced him to drink alcohol with cigarette ashes in it before allowing him to leave.
8
         
 The victim sought medical attention at Alexandra Hospital later that night.
 
 According to the medical report dated 21 July 2003 prepared by Dr Simon Chong Shih Jian, the victim sustained the following injuries as a result of the assault:
a.
        
 redness of the right eye
b.
        
 subconjunctival haemorrhage in the lower eyelid
c.
        
 1-cm abrasion at the nasal bridge
d.
        
 1-cm scratch mark at the left lateral canthal area
9
         
 The facts pertaining to the shoplifting charge were straightforward.
 
 On 13 May 2003, the accused was caught red-handed stealing two bottles of ‘Bacardi’ liquor at the NTUC Fairprice Supermarket located at Bishan Junction 8 shopping centre.
 
 He was spotted by Mr Ong Ying Khim (‘Mr Ong’), the security officer of the NTUC Fairprice outlet, taking the bottles from the refrigerator and handing them to his accomplice.
 
 The accused and the accomplice then walked out of the store without making payment.
10
       
 Mr Ong alerted his colleague and together they managed to detain the accused.
 
 Mr Ong also managed to retrieve the two stolen bottles of ‘Bacardi’ but could not prevent the accomplice escaping.
 
 To date, the accomplice has neither been identified nor located.
Sentences passed on accomplices to the rioting charge
11
       
 I was informed that Jason had been dealt with earlier and had been sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for the rioting charge and 3 months’ imprisonment for a charge of voluntarily causing hurt.
 
 The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
 
 Jason was traced for a previous conviction.
 
 Afzal was already undergoing a term of reformative training for a robbery offence when he was dealt with for the rioting offence.
 
 He was sentenced to a further term of reformative training.
 
12
       
 Vimal was given a stern warning.
 
 As for Ragumaran, Mr S Magintharan, counsel for the accused, explained that he was apparently given probation for other offences in 2003.
 
 Subsequently, on 4 February 2005, he was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the rioting offence.
 
Mitigation
13
       
 The accused had no previous convictions.
 
 He turned 21 on 3 September 2004.
 
 Some six weeks thereafter, he was charged in court with the present offences.
 
 Mr Magintharan submitted a comprehensive written mitigation plea.
 
 He urged the court not to impose a custodial sentence, as all the offences were committed when the accused was below 20 years of age.
 
 Moreover, the accused had changed his ways and had reformed himself before he was charged in court.
14
       
 The accused is now above 21 years of age.
 
 After completing his secondary school education in 1999, he had enrolled for a diploma course in Electronic Computer Communication at Nanyang Polytechnic but did not complete his course in 2002.
 
 He could not be re-admitted into the said course in 2003 as he had committed the present offences by then.
 
 Primary and secondary school reports were also tendered to attest to his previous good conduct.
 
 By the time he was charged with the present offences in October 2004, he had already been enlisted in full-time national service since June 2004.
 
 He signed on in September 2004 to serve as a regular serviceman in the Singapore Navy.
 
 However, upon being charged in court, he was suspended from his duties.
15
       
 Mr Magintharan was instructed that the accused comes from a loving and caring family.
 
 His parents recognised that they had been lax in their supervision of him in the past, thus allowing him to stray and mix around with undesirable company.
 
 They pleaded for him to be given another chance in life. 
 
 On his part, the accused himself attributed his wrongdoings largely to negative peer influence.
 
 He has since severed ties with these friends.
16
       
 Mr Magintharan further submitted that while the accused was performing his basic military training (‘BMT’), he had demonstrated his remorse and recanted his previous misdeeds.
 
 He exhibited a copy of his BMT Platoon Commander’s (undated) testimonial indicating that the accused was ‘a capable leader among his peers … always encouraging his fellow trainees to put in their best and maintain discipline at all times’.
 
 According to the testimonial, the accused had ‘expressed remorse and repentance for his past wrongdoings’ and had ‘definitely changed his ways since entering the army’.
17
       
 In respect of the rioting charge, Mr Magintharan sought to show that the victim himself was a secret society member.
 
 The victim was also a student at Nanyang Polytechnic, along with the accused, for the period 2000 to 2002.
 
 Mr Magintharan informed the court that the victim and his friends had accosted and assaulted the accused sometime in 2000.
 
 Subsequently, the victim had bullied the accused while they were still studying at the Polytechnic.
 
 The accused himself was said to have no secret society connections.
18
       
 The accused did not meet the victim again until they chanced upon each other at Bishan Junction 8 shopping centre on 22 May 2003, when the rioting offence took place.
 
 The accused recognised the victim and pointed him out to his group of friends, which included Ragumaran, Vimal and Afzal, as the person who had beaten him up during his Polytechnic days.
 
 According to the accused, his friends coaxed him to exact revenge.
 
 He proceeded to confront the victim and also threatened him but with no intention to commit any offence or to assault him.
 
 Thereafter the group asked the victim to follow them so that they could ‘question’ him as to why he had assaulted the accused.
   
19
       
 Along the way, the group met Jason, who recognised the victim as a member of a secret society who had assaulted him and caused him to be wheel-chair bound.
 
 Jason then started assaulting the victim to the surprise of the group.
 
 The accused claimed that he did not actually assault the victim at any time.
 
 However, the matter got out of hand and the victim suffered minor injuries as a result of the assault.
  
20
       
 Mr Magintharan submitted that the accused was remorseful and deserved a second chance.
 
 He had committed the offences when he was young and impulsive, while under the influence of bad company.
 
 Moreover, there had been undue delay in prosecution as a result of which the accused had suffered prejudice.
 
 He was only charged after he had turned 21, about 1½ years after the offences were committed.
 
 Citing 
Tan Kiang Kwang v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 280
, Mr Magintharan said that the delay in prosecution was a valid mitigating factor in the present case as it could be shown that ‘the accused had changed for the better between the commission of the offence and the date of sentence’.
21
       
 Mr Magintharan sought to show that if there had been no undue delay in prosecution, assuming that the accused had been charged before he turned 21, the court might well have granted him probation.
 
 It was submitted that probation would still be appropriate notwithstanding that he was already above 21 years of age.
 
 It would serve no purpose to imprison him, much less to subject him to caning.
 
 The accused had reformed himself and was no more a threat to society.
22
       
 On the issue of parity in sentencing, Mr Magintharan further pointed out that Vimal was let off with a stern warning and Ragumaran was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal.
 
 I have since ascertained from the court’s records that Ragumaran was originally placed on probation on 26 August 2003, three months after the rioting offence was allegedly committed.
 
 Ragumaran was only charged in relation to the rioting offence on 29 November 2004 in DAC 52301/2004.
Reasons for sentence
23
       
 I shall deal with this last point on parity (or perceived disparity) in sentencing first.
 
 Mr Magintharan sought to show that the prosecution’s decision not to further prosecute Ragumaran in February 2005 may have been a result of the court having voiced concern over the delay in prosecution in Ragumaran’s case.
 
 By the time Ragumaran was prosecuted in November 2004, he had already successfully completed his term of probation.
 
 At any rate, when the probation order was made in August 2003, the court had been apprised of Ragumaran’s pending rioting matter.
 
 As his role in the rioting offence had not been fully established at the time, no charge was actually brought against him then.
 
24
       
 Whatever the case, Ragumaran must consider himself very fortunate to have been placed on probation in August 2003.
 
 To his credit, he had managed to successfully complete the course of probation.
 
 In such circumstances, it was perhaps understandable why a decision was taken not to further prosecute him in relation to the rioting charge.
 
 Foreseeably, continued prosecution and the prospect of further punishment would have undone whatever good had been achieved by the earlier term of probation.
25
       
 As I pointed out in open court in the course of passing sentence, unlike Ragumaran, the accused was facing not merely one charge.
 
 He faced four charges in all and had pleaded guilty to two, with the other two counts taken into consideration.
 
 Ragumaran and Afzal were each charged with only one count of rioting.
 
 In any case, it should be noted that Afzal had pleaded guilty earlier and was sentenced to a further term of reformative training.
 
 Jason faced two charges.
 
 He had also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment in all.
 
26
       
 I had also noted that the accused had hardly played a passive role in the offence, notwithstanding Mr Magintharan’s attempt to minimise the extent of his involvement by putting forward a slightly different version of events in his mitigation plea.
 
 The accused himself had admitted to the statement of facts, which contained clear indications of how he had initiated the act of accosting the victim.
 
 He was also the one who had called Jason to tell him that ‘he had someone for him’.
 
 Jason then instructed them to bring the victim to the designated meeting point.
 
 Thereafter, they had subjected the victim to sustained mental and physical torment and abuse.
 
27
       
 All these facts indicated that there was at least a certain degree of premeditation to the offence.
 
 The statement of facts was in fact fortified by Mr Magintharan’s instructions to the effect that the group had wanted to ‘question’ (or rather interrogate) the victim as to why he had assaulted the accused and had wanted to ‘resolve the matter’ with the victim.
 
 These euphemistic phrases sounded innocuous enough, but they could scarcely conceal the fact that the group had acted with malice in mind.
28
       
 I was not persuaded by Mr Magintharan’s submission that the entire incident was a mere coincidental or spontaneous confrontation that somehow got ‘out of hand’ after Jason came into the picture.
 
 I regarded this submission with scepticism.
  
 The inferences that could be drawn from the statement of facts were clear.
 
 The initial act of accosting the victim itself may have been done on impulse, or as a show of bravado.
 
 If all they had intended was to resolve differences with the victim, this could have been achieved there and then.
 
 There was no necessity to call Jason to relay the sinister message that they ‘had someone for him’.
 
 There was no necessity to forcibly remove the victim’s handphone and wallet, relieve him of cash, and to compel him to follow them to their rendezvous with Jason at Block 292 Bishan Street 24.
 
 What eventually transpired did not appear to me to be simply a case of things getting ‘out of hand’.
29
       
 In my assessment, the group had shared the common object of making the victim suffer retribution for what he had allegedly done to the accused in 2000 as well as for his alleged involvement in the assault that resulted in Jason’s unfortunate physical state.
 
 In any case, the accused himself had already admitted fully to the extent of his involvement as characterised in the statement of facts, without making any attempt to qualify his plea.
 
 The accused and the remaining group members were present over each of the three separate instances of assault that ensued because they shared the common object of causing hurt to the victim.
30
       
 I would also unhesitatingly dismiss the suggestion that the offence was of a trifling nature since the victim ‘only suffered minor injuries as a result of the assault’.
 
 I would not consider the range of injuries noted in the victim’s medical report (see para 8 above) and in the statement of facts ‘minor’, having regard also to the series of three separate rounds of assault enumerated in the statement of facts.
 
 I would certainly not consider any offence of rioting trifling, especially where the victim had been forced by sheer weight of numbers to comply with the group’s demands and thereafter be subjected to repeated assaults and intimidation.
31
       
 I saw no merit in counsel’s suggestion that the accused did not actually intend to carry out his threat to kill the victim’s family members (the TIC charge in DAC 46372/2004).
 
 This can hardly be mitigating since the words uttered would clearly have caused the victim, or any reasonable man in his circumstances, to comprehend their threatening nature.
 
 There was clearly an objective basis for the victim to be alarmed and this would fortify the inference
 
 of guilty intent: see 
Ramanathan Yogendran v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 563
.
32
       
 I turn next to Mr Magintharan’s contention that the accused did not actually assault the victim.
 
 Presumably this point was made to justify a more lenient approach towards sentence.
 
 In rioting offences involving a group acting pursuant to a common object, efforts are often made to distinguish the roles of each member of the group.
 
 The High Court had however noted in 
Pannirselvam s/o Anthonisamy v PP
 
[2005] SGHC 26
 that where an accused is convicted on a charge involving common object to cause hurt, he is ‘not sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, since it is the very fact that his acts were not committed in isolation that constitutes the gravity of the offence’.
 
 Rather, he is sentenced for ‘having by deed or encouragement been one of the number engaged in a crime against the peace’, following 
R v Roderick Alexander Ferguson Caird
 (1970) 54 Cr App R 499.
33
       
 In practice, some consideration may be given to accused persons who play wholly nominal roles in a rioting offence, particularly where they are mere ‘bystanders’ or ‘observers’ to the unlawful assembly.
 
 Thus the court will still take into account the actual conduct of the offender in the riot, whether by way of aggravation or mitigation: see 
Lim Thiam Hor & Anor v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
.
 
 The accused could hardly be said to be a mere ‘bystander’ in the present case.
 
 By his own admission, the entire incident might not even have arisen but for his long-standing ‘grudge’ against the victim, dating back (according to his own account) to 2000.
 
 Seeing the opportunity to exact revenge, he found further strength in numbers.
 
 As the court noted in 
PP v Diki Zulkarnaini bin Saini
 (DAC 57026/2000):
Any participation whatever, irrespective of its precise form, in an unlawful assembly of this type derives its gravity from becoming one of those who, by weight of numbers, pursued a common and unlawful object.
 
 The law of this country has always leant heavily against those who, to attain such a purpose, use the threat that lies in the power of numbers.
34
       
 Seen in proper perspective, there was every reason to treat the accused as a key player in the rioting offence, and to note the seriousness of the offence itself.
 
 But for his initiatives, the offence would not have been committed. 
 
 It was also clear that the offence did not arise out of pure spontaneity.
 
 There was a certain element of premeditation, leading to the group accosting the victim and eventually subjecting him to repeated assaults and intimidation.
35
       
 Despite Mr Magintharan’s attempts to portray the accused as a person of consistent good conduct, I was not persuaded that this was necessarily the case.
 
I attached no weight to a Primary One school certificate awarded to him in October 1990 for ‘good conduct’ when he was only 7 years old.
 
 Curiously, no effort was apparently made to produce any such report from Nanyang Polytechnic, which would at least be of more recent vintage.
 
 I was only informed that the accused ‘unfortunately’ did not complete his course at the Polytechnic, but not of the reasons for this.
36
       
 The undated testimonial from the accused’s BMT Platoon Commander spoke well of his performance during the course.
 
 He had demonstrated good attitude towards training and shown that he was capable of leadership.
 
 More importantly, he was noted to have expressed ‘remorse and repentance for his past wrongdoings’.
 
 Thus it was suggested that he had made some effort to turn himself around while performing his national service.
 
 However, it was unclear how much weight I could attach to this testimonial, given that BMT spans a relatively short duration.
 
 As the testimonial indicated, the Platoon Commander appeared to have derived his information largely from piecemeal and intermittent ‘PC (ie. Platoon Commander) interviews’ with the accused.
 
 It was also not clear how much actual contact or interaction the Platoon Commander had with the accused to enable him to be convinced that the accused was indeed genuinely remorseful and repentant.
37
       
 Nonetheless, I accepted that the accused had, at the very least, expressed his remorse at various stages although he did not actually plead guilty at the first available opportunity.
 
 Various adjournments were sought to enable a total of five representations from counsel as well as his Member of Parliament to receive consideration from the Attorney-General’s Chambers.
 
 By the time he actually pleaded guilty, some five and-a-half months had elapsed since he was first charged.
38
       
 The accused had committed the offences when he was younger.
 
 Notwithstanding that, he could hardly be characterised as an immature and impressionable adolescent. Among the group of five persons identified as members of the unlawful assembly, only Jason was older than the accused.
 
 Ragumaran, Vimal and Afzal were all relatively younger than him, being 18, 18 and 17 years old respectively at the relevant time.
 
 In the premises, I saw little merit in his claims of being under negative peer influence.
 
 He was old enough to have known better – at the time of the offences, he was already well on his way to turning 20.
39
       
 Mr Magintharan relied on 
Tan Kiang Kwang v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 280
 in support of his submission that delay in prosecution can be a valid mitigating factor if it can be shown that ‘the accused had changed for the better between the commission of the offence and the date of sentence’.
 
 As a statement of general principle, this is well-established and I am familiar with the facts and reasoning in that decision.
40
       
 I gave due consideration to the considerations raised in 
Tan Kiang Kwang
.
 
 However, the circumstances in the present case were not such as to warrant a departure from the type of sentence ordinarily imposed in rioting cases where violence is actually used and the victim has sustained injuries.
 
 At the highest, they could mitigate the overall length of the custodial sentence.
 
 I was even prepared to go as far as to exempt him from the caning sentence which is usually imposed in rioting cases.
 
41
       
 As the accused had already turned 21, it was only in the most exceptional situations that probation might still be considered.
 
 I was not persuaded that this was one such instance.
 
 At any rate, even assuming that he had been charged before he turned 21, I did not share Mr Magintharan’s view that he might well have been placed on probation then.
 
 The seriousness of the offences, the extent of the accused’s involvement and the range of offences committed weighed heavily against probation in this case.
 
 While there was no evidence to suggest that the accused himself was a secret society member, it would not necessarily mean that this would justify a non-custodial sentence for an offence of rioting.
42
       
 Assuming that the charges had been preferred before the accused had turned 21, he would in all likelihood have been considered either for reformative training or imprisonment.
 
 If he had been sentenced to reformative training, he would have had to undergo a minimum term of 18 months at the reformative training centre (‘RTC’), up to a possible maximum of three years.
 
 Some accused persons have been known to request to be sentenced to imprisonment outright, being disenchanted with the prospect of what is perceived to be a longer period of ‘incarceration’ at the RTC.
Conclusion
43
       
 Custodial sentences are the norm for rioting offences.
 
 A clear message of deterrence must be sent to show that mindless acts of group-initiated violence and brutality cannot be tolerated.
 
 In the present case, a gang of seven had set upon one victim, motivated by what appeared to be two lingering vendettas.
 
 The victim was subjected to three separate rounds of assault.
 
 The accused and Jason had even threatened to kill his family.
 
 The fact that the victim himself may have been a secret society member is irrelevant.
 
 In addition, the accused faced another theft charge.
 
 A non-custodial sentence would have been manifestly inappropriate.
44
       
 The key mitigating factors were that the accused had kept himself away from crime since the commission of the offences, had expressed remorse and had owned up to the offences.
 
 He was a first offender and was still relatively young.
 
 In view of these considerations, I did not impose any caning sentence.
 
 I also ordered that his two sentences of 18 months’ and 2 months’ imprisonment respectively would run concurrently.",2005-04-19 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge Ronald Gwee
1.         The accused, Cheong Wai Keong (“Cheong”), pleaded guilty to a charge of driving whilst having so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of alcohol in his breath exceeded the prescribed limit, an offence under Section 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) and punishable under Section 67(1) and (2) of the RTA. This offence is popularly referred to as “drink driving”.
2.         Cheong was represented by Counsel. Cheong admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which had been read to him. The SOF recited that Cheong was the driver of motor car SDV 7890 M (the “car”). On 24 June 2004, the complainant, Sgt Kelvin Chee Hau (a police officer attached to Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre) attended to a dispute at 10 Ubi Crescent, Ubi Tech-Park Building.
3.         At the scene, Cheong admitted to the complainant that he, Cheong, had driven the car earlier, a short distance along Ubi Crescent. Cheong’s intention was to park the car inside Ubi Tech-Park Building but was stopped by the security guard. As Cheong gave out a strong smell of alcohol and had an unsteady gait, the complainant administered a breathalyzer test on Cheong. Cheong failed the test. Cheong was placed under arrest and escorted to the Traffic Police Division for a Breath Evidential Analyzer (“BEA”) test. The BEA test result showed that Cheong’s breath specimen contained 87 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, which exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.
4.         I convicted Cheong on his plea of guilt. The Prosecution submitted that Cheong had been previously convicted on 15 December 1983 of 2 charges relating to driving/permitting driving with an expired driving licence, and failure to insure against 3
rd
-Party risks. Cheong was sentenced to fines of $150 per charge, and was also disqualified in respect of a Class 2 driving licence for 12 months for the insurance charge. Cheong had several other previous criminal convictions, but these were not for traffic offences.
5.         The punishment prescribed for the first conviction under Section 67(1) of the RTA is a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. Enhanced punishment is prescribed for a second or subsequent conviction. In addition to the prescribed punishment in subsection (1), subsection (2) provides that a person convicted of an offence under the section “shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification, be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of his conviction or, where he is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of his release from prison.”
6.         Thus, disqualification for a minimum period of 12 months would be mandatory for a conviction under Section 67(1) of the RTA, unless “special reasons” were shown to the court, and the court thought fit to order otherwise. If no special reasons were shown, or upon the demonstration of special reasons the court was not minded to “order otherwise”, the court had to order disqualification for at least 12 months. The court also had power to order a longer period of disqualification, if it deemed it fit to do so.
7.         Defence Counsel made a mitigation plea on behalf of Cheong, and also submitted that there were special reasons in this case, thus warranting the consideration of the exercise of the discretion of not imposing the mandatory disqualification for the stated minimum of 12 months. The Defence was asking the Court to disqualify Cheong “for less than the mandatory period”.
8.         In the written submission tendered by Defence Counsel, it was stated that on the night before the date of the offence, Cheong had parked the car by the side of the road, along double yellow lines. Cheong had met his friends that night and had consumed alcohol. Cheong had no intention of driving the car that night after having parked it. The next morning (the date of the offence), Cheong was informed that “there was some problem with one of his workers, who was at the Techpark”. Cheong was asked to proceed to the location “to see if he could solve the problem”.
9.         It was then stated that when Cheong reached the location he “realized” that the car was parked along double yellow lines and “may cause obstruction” to other road users if “he left it there for the whole day”. Cheong therefore decided to move the car to the car park at the Techpark which was “just beside where he had parked his car”. Three photographs were annexed to the submissions to demonstrate where the car had been parked, along the road, before Cheong drove it into the Techpark.
10.       It was said that Cheong drove a distance of 25 feet from where he had parked the car “to the beginning of the driveway into the car park” and another 35 feet “along the driveway to the barrier of the carpark”. It was further said that Cheong had parked the car in a “designated parking lot” inside the car park. Cheong had driven the car at 7.55 am on the date of the offence. The Defence submitted that there was “no traffic on that road at that time” and that Cheong had driven “along the side of the road and turned left into the car park”. It was contended that as it was “still early in the morning, there was no one using the short stretch of the road”. It was said that Cheong parked the car in a parking lot in the car park, and had no intention of driving the car after that.
11.       It was the contention of the Defence that as Cheong had driven over a short distance “and in circumstances such that he was unlikely to be brought into contact with other road users”, these amounted to “special reasons” and therefore Cheong should be disqualified for a period shorter than the mandatory minimum of 12 months.
12.       What then are “special reasons”? The Honourable the Chief Justice, in 
Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor 
[2002] 2 SLR 73
, 77
 stated that a “special reason” may comprise “a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment”. A special reason was a reason “which is special to the offence but not … special to the offender” (at p 79). Further, the Chief Justice said (at p 77) that it was clear “that whether the facts of the case amount to ‘special reasons’ is a question of law and should be decided in view of the circumstances surrounding the offender’s commission of the offence”.
13.       In 
Sivakumar
 (
supra
 at p 77) the Chief Justice had phrased the question which faced the High Court in the appeal in that case as “whether the facts surrounding the commission of the s 67(1)(b) offence were extenuating or pressing circumstances that amounted to ‘special reasons’.” The appellant in the 
Sivakumar
 case had characterized the situation which led to his driving in that case as one which was brought on by an emergency. On this issue, the Chief Justice said (at p 78) that “(b)efore an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a crucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving”.
14.       In Cheong’s case, there was clearly no emergency. A careful study of the photographs tendered by the Defence shows that, in the position as asserted by the Defence, the car would have caused little or hardly any obstruction at all, certainly not of a level that called for its immediate removal by a person clearly not in a fit state to drive. The SOF had stated that Cheong had smelt strongly of alcohol and that his “gait was unsteady”. Cheong had admitted to these contentions without qualification. Having apparently committed the offence of parking alongside double yellow lines, it was certainly uncalled for Cheong to commit a more serious offence (under Section 67(1) of the RTA) just to move the car away from the road marked with the double yellow lines. There were no “extenuating or pressing circumstances” here, and Cheong did not demonstrate that “there was no alternative but for him to drive”, or that he had “explored every reasonable alternative before driving”. There was no valid reason for Cheong to drive in his inebriated state. He could have asked a sober driver to move the car. In the circumstances, there was nothing at all to suggest that the car had to be removed on an urgent basis. The most that Cheong could offer was that the car “may cause obstruction…if he left it there for the whole day”. There was nothing to suggest that the car was in fact causing obstruction.
15.       The Defence was relying on its contention that Cheong had driven only a short distance “and in circumstances such that he was unlikely to be brought into contact with other road users”. In support of this submission, the Defence made 2 unsupported assertions, that at 7.55 am, there was “no traffic on that road at that time of the day” and that “(a)s it was still early in the morning, there was no one using the short stretch of the road”. The date of the offence, 24 June 2004, was a weekday and was not a public holiday. The time of the offence (7.55 am) could not be said to be “still early in the morning”. The Defence did not show any evidence to support the said assertions. It was not unreasonable to assume that at 7.55 am on a working weekday, there might well have been vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic along that stretch of road, which appeared to be in the vicinity of places of work. As the Defence had made the contentions as bare assertions, uncorroborated by any evidence, I could not agree that these were circumstances such that Cheong was unlikely to have been brought into contact with other road users. It was more likely than not, that there may have been other vehicles and pedestrians in the vicinity of where the car was before Cheong drove it into the car park. In those circumstances, Cheong would have potentially been a danger to those around him when he made the decision to drive the car at the material time. As the Chief Justice said in 
Sivakumar
 (
supra
 at p 80), “Roads in Singapore have to be made as safe as possible for law-abiding road users and pedestrians. In cases of drink driving, the courts are always mindful that a motor car in the hands of an inebriated person is a potentially devastating weapon.” I found that the circumstances surrounding Cheong’s driving of the car on the material date did not amount to special reasons.
16.       Even if I am wrong in holding that the circumstances here do not amount to special reasons, that would not automatically mean that Cheong was entitled to a “discount” in the period of disqualification. In 
Sivakumar
 (
supra
 at p 78-79), the Chief Justice said that, “In any case, even if ‘special reasons’ were established, it did not automatically follow that the appellant would not be disqualified. There must be a separate process of considering whether the discretion must be exercised in favour of the offender”. Further, the Chief Justice said (at p 79), “In my opinion, the limited discretion not to disqualify 
can only be made in very exceptional circumstances,
 having regard to the special circumstances as well as to the whole of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.” (emphasis added). Whilst the reference was to the discretion “not to disqualify”, I am of the view that the discretion whether or not to impose a period of disqualification shorter than the mandatory minimum period of 12 months is similarly subject to the same circumspection, and should only be exercised in very limited situations.
17.       As to the circumstances which the court had to consider, the Chief Justice in 
Sivakumar
 (
supra
 at p 79) cited Lord Widgery CJ in 
Taylor v Rajan 
[1974] RTR 304
, 340
 who said, “Last, but by no means least, if the alcohol content in the defendant’s body is very high, that is a very powerful reason for saying that the discretion should not be exercised in his favour”.
18.       The BEA test result showed that Cheong had 87 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. This was more than 2.4 times above the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath.
19.       I could not ignore the fact that the alcohol level in Cheong’s body was very high. As stated earlier, the SOF had recited that Cheong’s gait was unsteady. Cheong asserted that he had consumed alcohol the night before the offence. Yet, it would appear that despite the passage of time through to the morning, the alcohol in Cheong’s body still had a very strong influence on him, causing his gait to be unsteady. The combination of the very high alcohol reading and the obvious physical manifestation of the adverse effect of the high alcohol content on Cheong’s bodily functions amounted to a “very powerful reason” why (even if special reasons did exist in this case) the discretion (not to disqualify for at least 12 months) should not be exercised in Cheong’s favour. In any event, this was not a case demonstrating “very exceptional circumstances”. The brevity of the episode of driving and the short distance travelled could not amount to “special reasons” but would have some weight as mitigating factors.
20.       
It is trite that the level of alcohol found in an offender’s breath (or blood as the case may be) would reflect the seriousness of the offence and affect the sentence to be meted out. In 
Ong Beng Soon v Public Prosecutor 
[1992] 1 SLR 731
; 
[1992] SGHC 48
, the Chief Justice stated that a “person substantially over the limit is obviously in more flagrant violation of the Act than a person marginally over the limit”. This was repeated by the Chief Justice in 
Silvalingam Sinnasamy v Public Prosecutor 
[2001] 3 SLR 157
; 
[2001] SGHC 154
.
21.       The alcohol level in Cheong’s body was high: it was more than 2.4 times the prescribed limit. For the level of alcohol in Cheong’s body, the tariff punishment would be a fine of not less than $2,500. The tariff disqualification would be for a period of not less than 2 years. I took into account all the mitigating factors put forth by Defence Counsel, especially (as stated above) the brief period of Cheong’s driving and the short distance travelled. In all the circumstances it was felt that the sentence (fine and period of disqualification) to be meted out to Cheong should be below the stated tariffs. I decided that a fine of $2,300 and disqualification for the mandatory minimum period of 12 months was sufficient in all the circumstances, and so ordered. Cheong appealed against the sentence.",2005-04-29 00:00:00,SG District Court

1          The appellant was convicted in the District Court on one charge of criminal intimidation towards one Yak Hong Chia (“Yak”) and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment under the first limb of s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed): see 
[2005] SGDC 57
.
 She appealed against her conviction alone. I dismissed the appeal, and now set out my reasons.
Facts
The charge
2         
 
The charge against the appellant read as follows:
DAC 29977/2004
You,
Name: Ong Sock Hung, Female, 54 years old
 NRIC: S2012789I
 Date of Birth: 15 March 1950
 Address: Block 101 Rivervale Walk #17-28
are charged that you, on 1st day of July 2004, at or about 1.15pm, at the 16th floor staircase, Blk 101 Rivervale Walk, Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation to one Yak Hong Chia, to wit, by pointing a chopper at Yak Hong Chia, and saying words to the effect “I will kill your whole family” in Mandarin, with intent to cause alarm to the said Yak Hong Chia, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The Prosecution’s case
3          The appellant and Yak lived at Block 101 Rivervale Walk, Singapore, and were neighbours for about six years. The appellant lived on the 17th storey at unit #17-28, a unit that was directly above Yak’s unit on the 16th storey.
4          There had been a long and acrimonious dispute between the appellant and Yak’s family. The appellant complained that there were odours coming from Yak’s flat and heat emanating from the walls of Yak’s flat. She scolded Yak and her family almost on a daily basis.
5          On 1 July 2004 at about 1.15pm, Yak was alone at home when she heard the appellant throwing things and making a lot of noise in the appellant’s flat. Yak then heard the appellant complaining about smells as she made her way down the staircase.
6          At that time, the door of Yak’s flat was open with only the grille gate locked. Yak took two steps towards the door and peeked outside. She saw a person at the foot of the staircase brandishing a chopper towards the direction of her flat. She only had a partial view of this person and could only see the person’s hand and leg. As the person gestured with the chopper by moving it forwards and backwards with a hacking motion, the person uttered very loudly in Mandarin words to the effect that she would kill Yak’s whole family. Yak recognised the voice to be that of the appellant. After a few seconds, the appellant went back to her unit, scolding continuously along the way.
7          Yak was frightened by the appellant’s threat. When the appellant left, she went out of her flat and, standing outside the opposite flat, asked her neighbour Mdm Lim Saw Gaik (“Mdm Lim”) if she had heard the appellant and seen the appellant coming downstairs with a knife. Yak, however, did not take note of Mdm Lim’s reply, as she was still in great fear that the appellant would come down with the chopper again. She quickly ran back to her flat.
8          Yak then called her husband, Tan Soo Chor (“Tan”), to inform him of what had happened. Tan was worried about her safety and told her to call the police. At about 1.43pm, Yak called the police for assistance. The police subsequently seized a chopper and two knives from the appellant’s house, and Yak identified the chopper as the weapon which the appellant had used to threaten her. The appellant was subsequently placed under arrest.
9          Mdm Lim testified in court that Yak had indeed gone over to her flat to inform her that the appellant had come down with a knife. Mdm Lim further testified that she did not hear or see anything out of the ordinary at the material time. However, it later transpired that on the day of the offence, Mdm Lim had told Sergeant Kelvin Phua Kai Shuan (“Sgt Phua”) that she had heard the words of the threat uttered by the appellant to Yak although she did not see the appellant wave the knife.
10        Tan was also called as a witness by the Prosecution, for the sole purpose of rebutting the appellant’s claims that the dispute between the appellant and Yak’s family was settled in May 2004. Tan testified that sometime in May or June 2004, he had gone to the appellant’s flat to try to resolve the dispute between them. He testified that on that day, he and the appellant were initially talking at their windows. He tried to explain to the appellant that what she experienced was not caused by him or his family, but the appellant did not accept his explanation and they ended up quarrelling. During the quarrel, Tan told the appellant, “Don’t force me to hit you.” In response, the appellant told Tan to come upstairs to her flat.
11        Tan subsequently went upstairs to find out what the appellant wanted. However, when he arrived at the appellant’s gate, the appellant, holding a chopper, walked towards the door and said, “You come and I am going to kill you.” Tan spoke to the appellant and, after a while, the appellant appeared to calm down. Tan denied the appellant’s claim that he had sworn to her that he was not responsible for the occurrences that disturbed her sleep. His evidence was that he could not say that the matter had ended amicably in May 2004, as by the time the meeting ended, he still did not know what the appellant was going to do to his family and him.
12        The Prosecution also adduced evidence from Dr Adrian Wang (“Dr Wang”), a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health. Dr Wang was of the opinion that the appellant was of sound mind at the time of the alleged offence and that she was fit to stand trial. However, Dr Wang’s provisional diagnosis was that the appellant was suffering from a delusional disorder. This was a mental illness characterised by the patient having a false, unshakeable and non-bizarre belief. Dr Wang noted that the appellant held a firm and unshakeable belief that her neighbours were against her, that there was an odour coming from her neighbour’s flat and that there was heat coming from the walls on the neighbour’s side. At the time of the trial, Dr Wang was keeping track of the appellant’s condition by scheduling outpatient visits for the appellant.
The defence
13        The appellant denied the allegations made against her. She testified that she was sleeping in her flat at the time of the incident.
14        The appellant gave evidence that in the middle of the night of 30 June 2004, she felt the walls of her flat warming up and cooling down a few times, before a surge of heat and a smell woke her from her sleep at 5.30am on 1 July 2004. She felt a little frustrated as this was not the first time such things occurred.
15        As the appellant was sweeping the floor later that morning, the walls again warmed up. The walls only cooled down at around 7.50am or 8.00am, but the kitchen tiles soon started to warm up. At about 8.05am, the appellant went downstairs to investigate and feel the walls. She touched the walls as she proceeded down the stairs from the 17th storey to the ninth storey. However, the walls felt normal.
16        At that time, the appellant was carrying a mobile telephone which had a pair of scissors and a key-chain hidden behind it. The appellant said that she usually carried a pair of scissors whenever she went out as a form of protection. The appellant was of the view that Yak could have seen her carrying the scissors and had mistaken the scissors for a chopper.
17        When the appellant went back to her flat, she found that the kitchen wall had cooled down. She then sent out an e-mail entitled “abusive neighbours/strange happening” to the relevant authorities at about 9.25am that morning. Subsequently, the appellant went to the market and returned to her flat at about 10.40am. She had her lunch at around 12.00 noon, after which she went to have an afternoon nap. She did not wake up until the police arrived outside her flat.
18        The appellant further testified that although she and Yak’s family had frequent quarrels, by 1 July 2004 she no longer suspected Yak’s family to be behind the strange odours and surges of heat that she experienced in her flat. This was because sometime in May 2004, Tan had gone to her house and sworn to her that he was not responsible for them, and she had believed him. The appellant also admitted that she had confronted Tan with a chopper during their conversation in May 2004. However, she claimed that this was because Tan had first stretched his arm through her gate, saying “I want to punch you long ago.” He had also shouted vulgarities at her and almost touched her chest. In anger, she had run to the kitchen and taken the chopper. Tan subsequently cooled down and swore to her that he had not disturbed the appellant’s sleep at night. The appellant maintained that the meeting ended amicably after she accepted his word.
The decision below
19        The trial judge noted that the Prosecution’s case against the appellant was based wholly on the identification evidence of Yak. After a careful consideration of the evidence, the trial judge held that the person who had waved the chopper and uttered the threats was the appellant. The trial judge found that Yak and Tan were credible and honest witnesses, whereas the appellant was not a credible witness. The trial judge further found that it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s threats had indeed been directed at Yak, with intent to cause alarm to her. The trial judge held that the Prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly, she convicted the appellant on the charge.
The appeal
20        On appeal, the appellant advanced a whole litany of complaints against the trial judge’s decision, many of which overlap with one another. I found it helpful to group the appellant’s main grounds of contention under four broad headings, which were:
(a)        the trial judge’s reliance on the evidence given by the various prosecution witnesses;
(b)        the identification of the appellant as the person outside Yak’s flat;
(c)        the person at whom the threat was directed; and
(d)        the admission of evidence that was prejudicial to the appellant.
21        I now deal with each ground in turn.
The trial judge’s reliance on the evidence given by the various prosecution witnesses
22        The appellant questioned the credibility of Yak and Tan, and argued that the trial judge had misdirected herself with respect to the proper inference which ought to be drawn from the evidence of Mdm Lim.
23        I noted at the outset that the trial judge had made a finding of fact that Yak and Tan were credible witnesses. It is trite law that an appellate court will be slow to disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. This is because the appellate court does not have the advantage of hearing the witnesses and observing their demeanour in court: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
; 
Dong Guitian v PP
 
[2004] 3 SLR 34
.
 An appellate court may thus reverse such findings only if it is convinced that the findings are wrong, and not merely because it entertains doubts as to whether the decision is right: 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
.
 However, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings, the appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
24        The appellant raised many arguments to advance her submission that Yak was an unreliable witness. In my view, all the arguments raised were unmeritorious. First, the appellant argued that Yak could not have known that the appellant threw things and made a lot of noise in her flat on the day of the incident, because it was not possible for Yak to see through the ceiling of her flat into the 17th floor unit above her. It was clear to me that although Yak could not actually see what the appellant was doing, it was possible for her to hear the sounds made by the person in the unit above her. Yak would have been aware that the appellant lived alone, given that Yak and the appellant had been neighbours for six years. Therefore, contrary to what the appellant argued, the evidence given by Yak that the appellant had thrown things and made a lot of noise in the flat above did not in any way show that Yak was a dishonest or unreliable witness.
25        Second, the appellant argued that it was odd for Yak to have seen the appellant wave the chopper and yet not have seen the appellant’s face. The appellant pointed out that Yak had explained her failure to see the appellant’s face by saying that she was frightened and did not look at the person’s face, yet she had contradicted herself by claiming that the appellant’s face was very fierce. However, from my perusal of the notes of evidence, it appeared to me that Yak had made an inference, and not an observation, that the appellant looked very fierce. Viewed in this light, I found that Yak had not contradicted herself on this point. Indeed, Yak clarified that she came to the conclusion that the appellant looked very fierce because of the fact that the appellant was scolding very fiercely on that day. Further, given that Yak saw the appellant holding a chopper and moving it forwards and backwards with a hacking motion, I found it unsurprising for Yak to have reached the conclusion that the appellant looked very fierce.
26        Third, the appellant pointed out various inconsistencies in Yak’s evidence. Yak testified in court that she could not see the handle of the chopper, whereas the evidence of Sgt Phua was that Yak had told him on the day of the incident that the handle of the chopper was black. The appellant also argued that Yak had given inconsistent evidence as to her location when she saw the appellant. She had initially said that she was sitting on the sofa in her flat when she saw the appellant, but she later changed her evidence to say that she took two steps from the sofa before she could see the appellant. The appellant further took issue with the inconsistencies in Yak’s testimony as to the time at which she had telephoned the police, as well as to the sequence of events that took place after the incident occurred and before she called the police.
27        In my opinion, these discrepancies did not show that the trial judge was plainly wrong in accepting Yak’s evidence. The trial judge had to look at the picture in its entirety in determining whether to believe Yak. It was my opinion that the discrepancies pointed out by the appellant regarding the colour of the handle of the chopper, the location that Yak was at, the time Yak called the police and the sequence of events were immaterial discrepancies which had no direct bearing on whether the appellant had committed the offence. As I previously held in 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
, in such a case the trial judge is perfectly entitled to find that the discrepancies do not detract from the general veracity of the prosecution witness on the material issues.
28        The next argument advanced by the appellant involved an attack on the credibility of both Yak and Tan. The appellant submitted that as there was a long history of enmity lasting five years between the appellant and Yak’s family, there was a strong probability that Yak and Tan had colluded to frame the appellant. This could be contrasted with the fact that no evidence was adduced to show any motive for the appellant to have thrown things about in her flat or threaten Yak in the manner alleged.
29        In my opinion, this argument was patently unsound. The appellant had made an assertion against Yak and Tan that was based on pure speculation. There was no evidence on the record to show that Yak and Tan had colluded to concoct evidence and frame the appellant. I did not think that the fact that there was a dispute between the parties necessarily led to the conclusion that Yak and Tan would go out of their way to concoct evidence against the appellant. On the other hand, I felt that there was a plausible motive for the appellant to have carried out the alleged acts. In this regard, I completely rejected the appellant’s claim that she had no motive to threaten Yak and her family because she no longer suspected Yak and her family to be responsible for the smell and heat that she experienced. This was because the e-mail that the appellant sent out on the morning of 1 July 2004 to the relevant authorities that was entitled “abusive neighbours/strange happening” showed that the appellant still thought that Yak’s family was responsible for the smell and the heat.
30        In the circumstances, I was of the opinion that the trial judge was not plainly wrong in holding that Yak and Tan were credible witnesses.
31        The appellant further argued that the trial judge had misdirected herself as regards the true and proper inference that she ought to have drawn from the evidence of Mdm Lim. The appellant pointed out that Mdm Lim had testified in court that she did not see or hear anything out of the ordinary. However, on the day of the incident, Mdm Lim had told Sgt Phua that she heard the words of the threat uttered by the appellant although she did not see the appellant wield the chopper. The appellant argued that the reason for this inconsistency was that Mdm Lim had initially agreed with Yak’s version of the events in the spirit of neighbourliness, but after going to court, she was impressed by the solemnity of the court proceedings and had then told the truth. The appellant argued that Mdm Lim’s testimony in court should thus have been believed in preference to the evidence given to the police officers.
32        In my view, there was no merit to this argument. The trial judge, at [41] of her Grounds of Decision, noted that her assessment of Yak’s credibility and veracity was not affected in any way by Mdm Lim’s evidence that she had not heard anything out of the ordinary before Yak went to her gate. It appeared, therefore, that the trial judge had not made use of the evidence that Mdm Lim gave the police officers to corroborate the evidence given by Yak regarding the witnessing of the threat. The appellant’s objection was thus invalid.
33        I further noted that the fact that Mdm Lim had not seen or heard anything out of the ordinary did not affect the Prosecution’s case against the appellant. Although Yak was the sole witness against the appellant, there is no requirement in law that her evidence has to be corroborated by an independent witness. Nevertheless, I was aware that in such circumstances, Yak’s testimony had to be so compelling to the extent that a conviction might be based solely on it: 
Kuek Ah Lek v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 252
 at [60]; 
Yeo Eng Siang v PP
 
[2005] SGHC 47
.
 In the present case, I was satisfied that a conviction of the appellant solely on the basis of Yak’s testimony was not unsafe. I saw no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that Yak was a credible witness. As the trial judge pointed out, it was not surprising that Mdm Lim had not heard or seen anything at the material time, as Mdm Lim was very busy attending to her children and chores, the television set was switched on, and her children were making a lot of noise.
34        For the reasons above, I found that the trial judge was justified in relying on the evidence given by Yak and Tan, and that she had not
 
misdirected herself with respect to the proper inference which ought to be drawn from the evidence of Mdm Lim.
The identification of the appellant as the person outside Yak’s flat
35        The appellant argued that the trial judge had erred in inferring that the appellant was the person outside Yak’s flat, when the quality of Yak’s visual identification had been very poor. The appellant pointed out that Yak had not seen the face of the person outside her flat but had only seen that person’s hand and leg. The appellant also submitted that the trial judge had given too much weight to the fact that Yak had purported to identify the person by her voice, when identification by voice was a weak and unsatisfactory form of identification.
36        I was of the view that the trial judge had not erred in her inference that the appellant was the person who had waved the chopper and uttered the threats. The trial judge had rightly pointed out that the Prosecution’s case against the appellant relied wholly on the identification evidence of Yak, and she had considered and applied the guidelines for the assessment of identification evidence which were stated in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
 and adopted in the recent case of 
Phua Song Hua v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 33
.
 The trial judge had correctly concluded that in terms of visual identification, the evidence was not of good quality. This was for the very reason that Yak had not seen the face of the person who had stood outside her flat, and had only seen the person’s leg and the hand holding the chopper.
37        In my view, the trial judge had not placed undue weight on the fact that Yak had purported to identify the appellant by voice. The trial judge had considered Yak’s identification by voice only after she had concluded that the visual identification evidence of the appellant was of poor quality and when she was ascertaining if there was other evidence which supported the correctness of the identification. The appellant failed to appreciate that the identification by voice was, however, only one factor that the trial judge took into account at this stage of the test. The second factor that the trial judge took into account was the fact that before the person uttered the threat to kill Yak’s whole family, the person had also complained about some odours. In addition, the trial judge took into account the fact that this person had been speaking from the 17th storey and subsequently as she made her way down the stairs to the 16th storey. The trial judge then held that it would be a very odd coincidence indeed that the person, if she was not the appellant, had a voice which resembled hers so closely, had the same grievance of bad odours against Yak and had come from the floor where the appellant lived. The trial judge held, on the authority of 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
, that odd coincidences could, if unexplained, be supporting evidence.
38        It was clear to me that the trial judge was correct in her analysis of the evidence. Contrary to what the appellant argued, the supporting evidence need not be visual as opposed to vocal. What was important was that the supporting evidence was evidence that made the judge sure that there was no mistake in the identification: 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
. In the present case, the numerous coincidences were sufficient to assure me that there was no mistake in the identification. Given that Yak and the appellant had been neighbours for about six years and Yak had been subjected to daily scoldings by the appellant, it was very likely that Yak had correctly recognised the voice of the appellant. There was no evidence that anyone else besides the appellant had complaints about a smell coming from Yak’s flat. Further, the appellant stayed alone in her unit most of the time and it was very unlikely that the complaining had come from someone else who was in the appellant’s flat. In my view, it was clear that the person who had uttered the threats and wielded the chopper was the appellant.
The person at whom the threat was directed
39        The appellant submitted that there was no evidence that she had pointed the chopper at Yak. The appellant claimed that the trial judge was wrong to infer that the threat was directed at Yak when there was no evidence that the appellant had faced Yak when she uttered the threatening words or that the appellant had intended to address those words to Yak.
40        In my opinion, this point was adequately addressed at [43] of the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision. As the trial judge pointed out, it was evident from the HDB floor-plan that the appellant could only see Yak’s unit and no other unit at the spot where the appellant stood with the chopper. The appellant must have known that Yak was at home at the material time, as the door of Yak’s flat was open and the television set was switched on. Further, the evidence of Dr Wang, the psychiatrist who examined the appellant, was that the appellant did not have a problem of seeing or imagining people who were not there. I also noted that the appellant had been complaining about some odours as she made her way down the staircase from the 17th floor. For the past six years, she had believed that the odours came from Yak’s flat. When the appellant stopped at the foot of the staircase on the 16th floor and uttered the threatening words and wielded the chopper, the reasonable conclusion therefore was that the words were directed at Yak and the chopper was pointed at Yak.
41        As such, I ruled that this ground of appeal should fail.
The admission of evidence that was prejudicial to the appellant
42        The appellant’s last argument related to the admission of certain evidence by the trial judge. The appellant claimed that the trial judge had erred in failing to exclude evidence given by Tan that the appellant had previously threatened him with a chopper. The appellant argued that such evidence was more prejudicial than probative, and would suggest that she was, by virtue of her previous behaviour, more prone to committing the present offence. The appellant also submitted that, beyond relying on Dr Wang’s expert opinion that the appellant was fit to stand trial, the trial judge should not have admitted into evidence Dr Wang’s provisional diagnosis that the appellant suffered from a delusional disorder. Such evidence was prejudicial to the appellant as it was akin to evidence of bad character and gave rise to an inference that the appellant had a propensity to commit the offence in question.
43        In my opinion, this argument was plainly untenable. The trial judge had made it very clear that Tan’s testimony on the meeting that he had with the appellant in May 2004 was relevant only for the rebuttal of the appellant’s claim that the dispute between Tan’s family and her had been resolved amicably in May 2004. It was only relevant for the rebuttal of the appellant’s claim that she had no motive in July 2004 to threaten to kill Yak’s whole family. The trial judge had made it very clear that she completely rejected the submission that the appellant, by her conduct towards Tan in May 2004, had demonstrated a propensity to arm herself with a chopper and make threats to kill people. In these circumstances, I was of the view that the trial judge had not erred in admitting the evidence given by Tan.
44        I also found that the trial judge had not erred in admitting the evidence given by Dr Wang. Besides accepting Dr Wang’s evidence for the purpose of establishing that the appellant was fit to stand trial, the trial judge had only considered the evidence for two other purposes. The first was to determine whether the appellant had directed her threat at Yak or at an imaginary person; and the second was to determine whether a lighter sentence would be appropriate for the appellant. The trial judge had therefore only considered Dr Wang’s evidence for certain purposes which were not prejudicial to the appellant, and had not made use of the evidence to establish that the appellant was more prone to committing the offence in question. In the premises, the trial judge had clearly not erred in admitting Dr Wang’s evidence.
Conclusion
45        A careful consideration of the notes of evidence and the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision led me to the conclusion that the appellant’s conviction should be sustained. Although Yak was the sole witness in this case, I was satisfied, on the whole of the evidence, that the charge against the appellant was made out. In my opinion, the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant were without merit and the appellant had failed to establish that the trial judge erred in convicting her. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.

Kan Ting Chiu J:
1          This is an action against a company for breach of contract and against its controlling shareholder for inducing the company to breach the contract.
2          The plaintiff, Otech Pakistan Pvt Ltd, is a company in Pakistan. The first defendant, Clough Engineering Limited, is an Australian company. The second defendant, William Harold Clough, is a shareholder of the first defendant.
3          The first defendant had entered into two contracts with Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd (“OGDCL”), a government-owned corporation in Pakistan, in connection with the construction of two gas-condensate processing plants. Both contracts did not run to the first defendant’s expectations. One contract was suspended, and OGDCL was seeking to encash a performance guarantee furnished by the first defendant. The first defendant suffered loss and damage under the other contract.
4          The first defendant engaged the services of the plaintiff to assist it to defend OGDCL’s claims against it and to prosecute its claims under the contracts against OGDCL.
5          The plaintiff claimed that in April 1997, the first defendant agreed to pay it for its services 40% of any amount recovered from OGDCL in excess of US$8m.
6          In November 1999, that agreement was renegotiated so that the first defendant was to pay the plaintiff 20% of the net amount recovered from OGDCL with no minimum on the amount the first defendant received.
7          In the action, the plaintiff alleged that after the first defendant had settled its claims against OGDCL for US$7,515,000, the first defendant did not pay the plaintiff its agreed fees of US$1,503,000 (20% of US$7,515,000).
8          The plaintiff sued the first defendant for breach of contract. It also sued the second defendant for having induced the first defendant to breach the contract.
9          In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleged:
3.         The Second Defendant has been and is a controlling shareholder of the First Defendants. He was the Managing Director of the First Defendants until 1988. He has been a major and substantial shareholder of the First Defendant either directly or through other companies. As such, he has been the major motivating force behind the said the First Defendants and their alter ego.
…
27.        On or about 28 March 2002, Jeremy Roberton and Paul Archer of the First Defendants met with the Plaintiffs’ Director, Sohail Latif and breached the First Defendants’ agreement to pay 20% of the settlement amount of the First Defendants’ claims against OGDCL. Jeremy Roberton stated so. Jeremy Roberton said to Sohail Latif that they were authorized and directed by the Second Defendant to state that the First Defendants would not pay the agreed remuneration. The breach occurred in Singapore.
…
30.        The Second Defendant engineered and induced the First Defendants to breach their contract or agreement to pay remuneration as described above. The Second Defendant did so by direct interference. He did so by instructing Jeremy Roberton to state that the First Defendants would not pay the Plaintiffs their agreed remuneration. The Second Defendant had full knowledge of the contract between the Plaintiffs and the First Defendants. He intentionally interfered with the Plaintiffs’ contractual rights and had no justification for it. In the circumstances, the Second Defendant is liable in tort to pay the sum of US$1,503,000 as damages for inducing breach of contract.
10        The defendants applied for paras 3 and 30 in their entirety, as well as the third sentence of para 27, to be struck out on the basis that the claims against the second defendant “disclose no reasonable cause of action, are an abuse of the process of the Court and/or should be struck out pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court”.
11        Although counsel for the defendants was convinced that the application must succeed, it was dismissed by the senior assistant registrar who heard it, and I dismissed the defendants’ appeal against that decision. I will explain why the application had failed.
12        The defendants relied on the decision in 
Chong Hon Kuan Ivan v Levy Maurice (No 2)
 
[2004] 4 SLR 801
.
 In that case, the defendant, Maurice Levy (“Levy”), was a director of a company, Publicis Eureka Pte Ltd (“Publicis”). The plaintiff, Chong Hon Kuan Ivan (“Chong”), had been the managing director and chief executive officer of Publicis, whose employment was terminated by Publicis.
13        Chong commenced action against Publicis and Levy and other directors of Publicis. Chong’s claim against Levy was that Levy had conspired with the other directors of Publicis to induce Publicis to terminate his employment, and his claim against Publicis was for the wrongful termination of his employment agreement.
14        Levy applied to strike out two paragraphs of the statement of claim which contained allegations of the conspiracy, inducement and the resultant damages. Levy’s application was founded on the principle that a company can only act by its officers, servants or agents and if the individual defendant was acting within the scope of his employment, as the company’s 
alter ego
, the claim of conspiracy must fail.
15        The application was heard by an assistant registrar who allowed it. Subsequently, Chong amended his statement of claim to rely on certain exceptions to the principle referred to. After the amendment, the assistant registrar reversed the previous order to strike out the action.
16        In the amended form, Levy was alleged to have conspired with the other directors of Publicis to procure Publicis’ termination of Chong’s employment. It was also alleged that Levy and the other directors were acting outside the scope of their office or employment when they did that.
17        Levy appealed against the assistant registrar’s second decision. The appeal was heard by Woo Bih Li J. Woo J reviewed cases on this point from several jurisdictions. In particular, he acknowledged and adopted a principle enunciated by McCardie J in 
Said v Butt
 
[1919] 3 KB 497.
18        In 
Said v Butt
, the plaintiff had obtained a ticket for the first performance of a play at a theatre. He knew that the theatre would not sell him a ticket, and bought a ticket through a friend. The defendant, the managing director of the theatre, saw him at the theatre and directed the theatre attendants to refuse the plaintiff admission to the performance. After he was denied admission, the plaintiff sued the defendant for procuring the theatre to breach the contract for his attendance at the performance.
19        McCardie J dismissed the action. He found that there was no enforceable contract between the plaintiff and the theatre. But he went further and examined the claim on the assumption that there was a contract.
20        He noted at 504:
If the plaintiff is right in his contention, it seems to follow that whenever either a managing director or a board of directors, or a manager or other official of a company, causes or procures a breach by that company of its contract with a third person, each director or official will be liable to an action for damages, upon the principle of 
Lumley
 v. 
Gye
 (1853) 2 E. & B. 216, as for a tortious act. So, too, with the manager or other agent of a private firm, who does the like thing.
and went on to say at 505:
[T]he servant who causes a breach of his master’s contract with a third person … is the alter ego of his master. His acts are in law the acts of his employer. In such a case it is the master himself, by his agent, breaking the contract he has made, and in my view an action against the agent under the 
Lumley
 v. 
Gye
 principle must therefore fail, just as it would fail if brought against the master himself for wrongfully procuring a breach of his own contract. This, I think, is the true answer to the ingenious arguments … on behalf of the plaintiff upon this point.
and therefore:
[I]f a servant acting bona fide within the scope of his authority procures or causes the breach of a contract between his employer and a third person, he does not thereby become liable to an action of tort at the suit of the person whose contract has thereby been broken.
21        It should be noted that although McCardie J referred to “servant” in the last two passages quoted, he was using the term broadly to cover persons of authority, such as directors and managers who are the management of a company, when he referred to “the servant who causes a breach of his master’s contract”.
22        Woo J reviewed cases from several jurisdictions and concluded that the principle was subject to two conjunctive qualifications: (a) that the servant must be acting 
bona fide
; and (b) that he must be acting within the scope of his authority.
23        On the facts of that case, he ruled that the allegations that Levy and the other directors were acting outside the scope of their authority were bare allegations. Consequently, he allowed the appeal and struck out the allegations of conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract.
24        In deciding whether and how the principle applies to a case, the pleaded connection between the company and the human defendant is important. The claim may be made on the basis that the defendant, as a director or officer of a company, had conspired with others to induce the company to breach a contract. Or the claim may be framed simply that the defendant had conspired to and had induced the breach without reference to his office in the company.
25        When the allegation is that the defendant had conspired to and had induced the breach 
qua
 director, that, without more, must imply that the defendant had been acting 
bona fide
 and within the scope of his office. “
Bona fide
” here is to be taken to mean that the defendant was acting in good faith in the discharge of his office, and not that he was acting in good faith in the action complained of; a director may believe that it is for the good of the company to breach a contract intentionally. In such a situation, the principle would operate to defeat the claim against the defendant as a matter of law.
26        Where the allegation of conspiracy and inducement is made without reference to the defendant’s office, the principle will not apply unless steps are taken to bring it into operation. The initiative would have to be taken by the defendant to show the acts alleged against him were done by him in good faith in the discharge of his office.
27        The position is the same where the allegation is that the defendant had acted in bad faith or in excess of his powers when he purported to act in the discharge of his office.
28        In the last two situations, the claims are not defeated unless the defendant proves the qualifying facts, 
ie
 that the actions (a) were taken in good faith, and (b) were within the scope of his office.
29        Coming back to the facts of the present case, there is no reference in the Statement of Claim to the second defendant’s position in the first defendant. The allegations were that he “has been a major and substantial shareholder” and he “has been the major motivating force behind [the first defendant] and [its] alter ego”. In fact, the second defendant was not a director of the company or, as far as it was disclosed, the holder of any office in the company when the alleged conspiracy or inducement took place.
30        In these circumstances, the plaintiff’s claim against him does not carry the fatal flaw McCardie J identified in 
Said v Butt
 (see [20] and [21] above)
.
31        The second defendant may still rely on the principle in that case to defeat the claim if he can bring himself under the principle. But in his Defence filed to the claim, it was not pleaded that he was acting in good faith and within the scope of his authority as an officer of the company. The invocation of the principle to strike out the claim against him was without basis.",2005-05-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

District Judge Siva Shanmugam
1.         The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of consuming Nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug,  an offence under s8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act Chapter 185.
The charge
2.         The charge against the Accused reads as follows:
DAC 17417/2005
You, Lee Kok Hong, are charged that you, on or about 23
rd
 March 2005, in Singapore, did consume a controlled drug specified in Class C of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act , Cap 185, to wit, Nimetazepam, without authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(i) and punishable under Section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185”.
3.         The Accused was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one month.
Facts
4.         The Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution is reproduced here:
“STATEMENT OF FACTS
1.         Accused person is Lee Kok Hong, M/24 years, DOB 06.06.1980, I/C: S8070757F. Accused is presently working as a waiter at KTV.
2.         On 23
rd
 March 2005 at about 0330 hrs, the accused was arrested at Este Disco Pub at Clarke Quay on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug.
3.         Whilst at Central Police Divisional Headquarter, Central Narcotics Bureau office, two bottles of urine samples collected from the accused were sealed as “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SA-05-00634-1 LEE KOK HONG S8070757F” and C-SA-05-00634-2 LEE KOK HONG S 8070757F” in his presence.  The samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority on 23
rd
 March 2005 for analysis.
4.         On 15
th
 April 2005, the Health Sciences Authority issued Chemist certificates bearing Lab nos. N2-2005-03170-070 and N2-2005-03170-079 respectively, stating that the urine samples marked C-SA-05-00634-1 LEE KOK HONG S8070757F” and C-SA-05-00634-2 LEE KOK HONG S 8070757F” were analyzed and found to contain Nimetazepam which is a class C controlled Drug listed in The First Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act Chapter 185.(Cap.185)
5.         The accused had therefore consumed the said controlled drugs without any authorization under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185) or the Regulations thereunder and is charged accordingly for one count of consumption of a controlled drug under Section 8(b)(i) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), Chapter 185.”
Mitigation
5.         In mitigation the Accused merely pleaded for leniency.
Prescribed Punishment
6.         An offence under s8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act is punishable with a maximum fine of $20,000 or imprisonment for 10 years or both.
Sentencing Considerations
7.         In assessing the appropriate sentence to be passed on the Accused the Court was guided by the recent decision of 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP
 
[2005] SGHC 63
.
8.         In 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia,
 V K Rajah J, following an enlightening review of the sentencing benchmarks and tariffs for consumption offences, opined that the appropriate spectrum of imprisonment for first time consumers of Class A drugs is between 6 to 18 months.
9.         The Judge in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
 went on to make the following instructive observations on sentencing considerations:
“Adopting this wider spectrum of sentencing options for first-time offenders will allow adequate regard to be duly given to the many imponderables involved when such offences are committed, such as: What was the amount of drug(s) consumed (though admittedly evidence related to this may not invariably be reliable depending on how soon after the consumption of a drug the urine sample was taken); what was the occasion that led to the act of consumption; was it planned or incidental to some other event; were there several others simultaneously consuming drugs; was any payment involved; is the accused a first-time drug consumer, a casual consumer or an addict? While this is by no means a comprehensive or exhaustive list, it is intended to highlight some of the thought processes a sentencing judge should apply when determining the appropriate custodial sentence for drug consumption offences. Given that not all offences of consumption are the same, it follows that not all acts of consumption ought to be punished identically with a rigid, immutable starting point that constitutes an end by itself.”
10.       The Judge in the same case also raised the following suggestion on the role of the Prosecution in the sentencing exercise:
“I
 
would also suggest, for the future, that if the Prosecution intends to press for a particularly deterrent sentence in relation to a consumption offence, it should adduce evidence either through the Statement of Facts or otherwise of the circumstances pertaining to the act of consumption.”
11.       In 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
 the Accused was sentenced to a ‘higher than usual’ 8 months imprisonment due to the Accused’s relative maturity as well as the nature of the drug involved, namely cocaine.
12.       The Statement of Facts in the instant case reveals that the Accused was arrested at Este Disco Pub at Clarke Quay on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug. His urine samples were subsequently analyzed and found to contain Nimetazepam.  
13.       The Accused, a male, aged 24 years, was a first offender. He had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity in the First Criminal Mentions Court. He was unrepresented in Court. 
14.       Despite the observations made in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
, the Prosecution in the present case, though not pressing for a deterrent sentence, had also seen it fit not to address the Court on the sentencing considerations identified in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
. No evidence was led either through the Statement of Facts or otherwise as to the circumstances surrounding the act of consumption, whether any payment was involved and whether the accused was indeed a first-time drug consumer or a casual consumer or an addict.
15.       The Accused’s act of consumption was his very first brush with the law and drugs. Based on the Accused’s lack of drug abuse history and in the absence of any other evidence to suggest otherwise, the Court was drawn to infer that this was indeed a one-off episode with no aggravating features present.   
16.       The nature of the drug involved would be a relevant consideration.
 
The Honourable the Chief Justice made the following observation in dealing with Ecstasy, a Class A drug in
 
Ooi Joo Keong v PP
 
[1997]
 
2 SLR 68
 :
“It is generally not for the courts to determine the relative dangers of various drugs, especially when Parliament has, no doubt with the benefit of expert advice, deemed it proper or even necessary to classify the drug as belonging to a class which can be described as most dangerous.”
17.       The drug involved in the present case is
 
Nimetazepam. Parliament had deemed it proper to classify Nimetazepam as a Class C controlled drug, at the lower end of the spectrum of dangerous drugs.
18.       In 
Shan Kai Weng v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 274
, the Accused, who had no record of drug abuse, was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for an offence of possession of a Class C drug under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
19.       The Judge in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
 had also not ruled out the imposition of fines as adequate punishment in appropriate cases:
“I do not intend to catalogue the instances when a fine would be appropriate; suffice it to say that while the judicial discretion to impose a fine is ex facie statutorily conferred without any fetter, it should be employed, in so far as Class  A drug offences are concerned, only sparingly and in purely exceptional cases.”
20.       Notwithstanding that Nimetazepam is a Class C drug, the Court was of the view that the mere imposition of a fine would not be a suitable sentence in the instant case. General deterrence has always been a necessary consideration in dealing with offences relating to controlled drugs and the present case was no exception. The imposition of a fine may also convey the wrong impression that experimentation with drugs may be tolerated: see 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
21        In assessing the appropriate sentence to be passed the Court took into account all the circumstances of the case, the absence of a drug abuse record and the nature of the drug involved. The Court sentenced the Accused to imprisonment for a term of one month.
22.       The Prosecution has now formed the view that the sentence passed is manifestly inadequate and has filed a notice of appeal.",2005-05-19 00:00:00,SG District Court

Given that not all offences of consumption are the same, it follows that not all acts of consumption ought to be punished identically with a rigid, immutable starting point that constitutes an end by itself.”
10.       The Judge in the same case also raised the following suggestion on the role of the Prosecution in the sentencing exercise:
“I
 
would also suggest, for the future, that if the Prosecution intends to press for a particularly deterrent sentence in relation to a consumption offence, it should adduce evidence either through the Statement of Facts or otherwise of the circumstances pertaining to the act of consumption.”
11.       In 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
 the Accused was sentenced to a ‘higher than usual’ 8 months imprisonment due to the Accused’s relative maturity as well as the nature of the drug involved, namely cocaine.
12.       The Judge in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
 had also not ruled out the imposition of fines as adequate punishment in appropriate cases:
“I do not intend to catalogue the instances when a fine would be appropriate; suffice it to say that while the judicial discretion to impose a fine is ex facie statutorily conferred without any fetter, it should be employed, in so far as Class  A drug offences are concerned, only sparingly and in purely exceptional cases.”
13.       In 
Shan Kai Weng v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 274
, the Accused, who had no record of drug abuse, was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for an offence of possession of a Class C drug under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
14.       The Statement of Facts in the instant case reveals that the Accused was arrested at Tiong Bahru Plaza. He had in his possession 10 tablets containing Nimetazepam. His urine samples were subsequently analyzed and found to contain Nimetazepam.  
15.       The Accused, a male, aged 32 years, was a first offender. He had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity in the First Criminal Mentions Court. He was unrepresented in Court. 
16.       Despite the observations made in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
, the Prosecution in the present case, though not pressing for a deterrent sentence, had also seen it fit not to address the Court on the sentencing considerations identified in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
. No evidence was led either through the Statement of Facts or otherwise as to the circumstances surrounding the act of consumption, whether any payment was involved and whether the Accused was indeed a first-time drug consumer or a casual consumer or an addict. There was also no evidence to suggest that the Accused had actively procured the drugs found in his possession: see 
Shan Kai Weng.
17.       The Accused’s present offences was his very first brush with the law and drugs. Based on the Accused’s lack of drug abuse history and in the absence of any other evidence to suggest otherwise, the Court was drawn to infer that this was indeed a one-off episode with no aggravating features present.   
18.       The nature of the drug involved would also be a relevant consideration.
 
The Honourable the Chief Justice made the following observation in dealing with Ecstasy, a Class A drug in
 
Ooi Joo Keong v PP
 
[1997]
 
2 SLR 68
 :
“It is generally not for the courts to determine the relative dangers of various drugs, especially when Parliament has, no doubt with the benefit of expert advice, deemed it proper or even necessary to classify the drug as belonging to a class which can be described as most dangerous.”
19.       The drug involved in the present case is
 
Nimetazepam. Parliament had deemed it proper to classify Nimetazepam as a Class C controlled drug, at the lower end of the spectrum of dangerous drugs.
20.       Notwithstanding that Nimetazepam is a Class C drug, the Court was of the view that the mere imposition of fines would not be a suitable sentence for the current offences. General deterrence has always been a necessary consideration in dealing with offences relating to controlled drugs and the present case was no exception. The imposition of a fine may also convey the wrong impression that experimentation with drugs may be tolerated: see 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia
21.       In assessing the appropriate sentence to be passed the Court took into account all the circumstances of the case, the absence of a drug abuse record and the nature of the drug involved. The Court sentenced the Accused to imprisonment for a term of one month on each of the two charges. As the offences were distinct, the Court further ordered the sentences to run consecutively.
22.       Apart from the present case, this Court had also imposed a one month imprisonment sentence on 3 other cases involving first time consumers of Class ‘C` drugs: see

26 May 2005
 
District Judge Aedit Abdullah
1.
        
 The Appellant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of one count of forgery, under s 465 Penal Code, for which he was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment.
  
 The Appellant being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the reasons for the sentence are now given.
The charge
2.
        
 The charge against the Appellant reads:
You, Ho Wei Chuan, M 36 years old, NRIC No. 6817856H, DOB 11.05.1968, are charged that you on the 11th day of October, 2004 at about 11.00 pm at Deck B3 of Block 527 Choa Chu Kang Street 51, #06-277, Singapore, did fraudulently forge a document, namely, HDB season car park label for the month of October 2004, to wit, by using a scanner and altering the dates and vehicle number on the said carpark label, with the intention of causing it to be believed that it was original documents issued by HDB, and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 465 Penal Code Cap 224.
The facts
3.
        
 The material portions of the Statement of Facts admitted by the Appellant read as follows:
4.
        
 On 12.10.2004 at about 9.30 am the complainant called Police informing that he found a car parked using a forged HDB season car park label.
5.
        
 Investigations revealed that on 11.10.2004 at about 10.00 am, accused went over to his sister’s place to take over [his] sister’s car SDV 5537Y as he was given custody of the car while [his] sister was away in Thailand.
 
 On the same day and at about 10.00 pm, he parked the car at deck B3 at Block 527A Choa Chu Kang Street 51 and proceeded home.
6.
        
 On the same day at about 11.00 pm, while the accused was at home, he used his Canon scanner to scan an image of a used HDB season parking label into his Acer laptop and used the software Adobe Photoshop to edit the image. He edited the validity period to 1.10.04 - 31.10.04 and the vehicle registration number to SDV 5537Y.
 
 After doing so, he printed the image using an Epson Colour printer.
 
 Upon printing the re-produced parking label, he displayed the said label on the dash board of the said car and used it as a genuine.
7.
        
 On 12.10.04 at about 8.50 am, the complainant received complaints about illegal parking at Block 527A Choa Chu Kang Street 51 and together with other enforcement officers, made a check.
 
 They randomly checked on the car registration plates using their handheld ticking system and discovered that the accused had displayed a re-produced parking ticket and display it on motor car SDV 5537Y.
8.
        
 Accused thus had forged as HDB season car park label valued at $88.20 cents for the month of October 2004, by using a scanner and altering the dates and vehicle number on the said carpark label with the intention of causing it to be believed that it was [sic] original document issued by HDB.
Antecedents
4.
        
 The Appellant has no previous conviction.
Mitigation
5.
        
 The Appellant relied on his letter of mitigation in which he expressed regret for what he had done and that his moment of foolishness had not only affected him, but his family as well.
 
 He further said that since his business failure and that he was declared a bankrupt in 2001, he has not been able to secure a full time job and is working on a part time basis till the hearing.
 
 His father had passed away three months previously, and he needed to take care of his 60 year old mother and one year old baby girl.
 
 He pleaded for leniency from the Court as throughout his 36 years of life he had not committed any criminal offence before.
 
 He had nothing to add in oral mitigation.
6.
        
 After sentence was passed, the Appellant again pleaded for a fine to be imposed.
 
 He reiterated he had to take care of his mother.
  
 I informed him that I had already passed sentence, and would not in any event, change what had been imposed.
7.
        
 I should also note that the Appellant in his written mitigation asked that the media be prevented from reporting the matter, to protect his part time job.
 
 I was of the view though that there was nothing in this case that warranted any restriction on the publication of information.
Prosecution’s submissions
8.
        
 The Prosecution did not address the Court on sentence. 
 
The Sentence imposed
Imposing imprisonment
9.
        
 In arriving at the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the Court was well aware that the charge against the Appellant was under s 465 for simple forgery rather than aggravated forms, such as forgery of public documents under s 466, or forgery for the purposes of cheating under s 468.
   
 The appropriate sentence therefore had to be measured against the range of conduct caught by s 465.
 
 It also had to be within the prescribed punishment under s 465, which was up to 2 years’ imprisonment or fine, within the District Court limit, or both.
 
10.
      
 There were to my mind a number of factors which showed that a fine was not an appropriate punishment. 
  
 Firstly, what was significant about the commission of the offence by the Appellant was that the forgery was not a simple alteration of a letter or two in a handwritten note.
 
 The Appellant had taken some pains to commit his crime. He had scanned in the image of a used parking label, altered the validity period and the vehicle registration number, and then printed out the fake label using a colour printer.
    
 This showed that the criminal act was not impulsive or committed on the spur of the moment.
  
 It clearly required thought, planning and premeditation; this was an aggravating feature:
 
 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] SGHC 80
.
 
 
  
 Though he had done all this within the space of a day or less, this did not detract from the fact that this was a considered act requiring the planned use of the computer equipment and peripherals to manufacture a fake car park label.
 
11.
      
 Secondly, the forgery was not targeted merely at a private individual, or a commercial entity.
 
 The target here the Housing and Development Board, which built and runs the carparks as part of its statutory functions under the Housing and Development Act,
 
 presumably s 13(b), which deals with the function of the
 
 HDB to manage property vested in it.
 
 While private entities do also own and maintain carparks, this does not detract from the public function performed by the HDB here.
   
 Though the charge against the Appellant was not one of forgery of a public document, as was the case in 
Wong Kum Meng v PP
 MA 418/93/01
,
 which involved a forged road tax disc, the criminal act did affect the performance of public functions by the HDB. 
  
 It was not a private loss, but one suffered by a public body in the performance of its public functions. 
  
 Fraud on the authorities calls for a deterrent response:
   
 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
, at para 29.
 
12.
      
 Thirdly, it is necessary to deter similar acts of forgery. 
  
 An unequivocal and strong message of the sort highlighted in
 
 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
 and 
Lim Teck Chye v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 72
 had to be given to deter similar offences.
 
 The Prosecution did not submit on the need for deterrence, but that lies within the discretion of the Court: 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
[1998] SGHC 50
.
 
 
 
 Given that scanner and colour printing technology are easily available, and lend themselves readily to the production of forgeries, the temptation to misuse these technologies must be quashed.
 
 Those foolish enough to so misuse the technology must be punished to a degree to deter others from similarly committing such acts.
13.
      
 It is no answer to the need for general deterrence that the forgeries may be easily caught.
 
 
  
 Ease of detection of a particular criminal act may mean that those who are foolish enough to commit the crime will be caught, and this may in itself act as an instrument of deterrence.
 
 But the operation of this deterrence through effective enforcement does not mean that there should not also be deterrence by way of the sentence imposed.
 
 Where the need is great enough, deterrence may have to be supplied by various means.
 
 To my mind, given the ready availability of the technology and method employed by the Appellant here, this is indeed such a case.
14.
      
 In the present case the Appellant was apparently caught out because the enforcement officers had run the licence numbers through a hand held system.
   
 That the Appellant’s forgery was easily discovered in this instance did not justify a lenient treatment of the Appellant, or that the need for deterrence was negated.
   
 The ability of an enforcement agency to detect criminal acts does not confer any credit on the accused when it comes to sentencing.
 
 It has nothing to do with him.
 
 It shows neither remorse nor good conduct on his part.
 
 The efforts, expertise and expense incurred by the enforcement agency cannot lead to a lower sentence being imposed on the accused.
   
15.
      
 It is true that the fact a criminal act is so badly conceived that it has no chance of success is a relevant factor in sentencing.
  
 In 
Nomura Taiji v PP
 
[1998] SGHC 19
, the Honourable the Chief Justice said [at para 135]:
I agreed with the trial judge that the amount of the loss which could have resulted was an important factor to be taken into account in determining the severity of the sentences. However, it is not in every case that the sentence should reflect proportionately to the amount of the loss which could result to the victim. In this case, given that the amount was so astronomical, I would have thought that the appellants would have known better than to try to pull a stunt like this and think that they could get away with it. I thought that the scam was so ridiculous and absurd that it would never have succeeded in any event, and I felt that this had to be taken into account in determining the sentences for the appellants.
This consideration was not however material in the present case.
 
 The discussion in 
Nomura
 
 
 was focussed on whether the amount in question there, which was a very large amount, called for a correspondingly severe sentence.
 
 The Honourable the Chief Justice concluded it did not because the criminal act was unlikely to succeed.
 
 In the present case, however, the need for a deterrent sentence could not be outweighed by lack of success of the criminal act, for the reasons given above.
     
 Furthermore, the sum involved in the forgery here was not large, and was not in itself, unlike 
Nomura
, a reason for a heavy sentence.
 
 Rather it was the other factors highlighted above which called for a deterrent sentence, and these are not negated by the lack of success, or minimal prospect of success.
16.
      
 While there was apparently no reported or cited similar case involving s 465, there have been a number of cases concerned with the alteration of vehicular documents and punishable under the Road Traffic Act, RTA.
  
 Section 129(2) makes it an offence for anyone to alter a document carried on a vehicle or licence issued under the Act.
  
 A range of offences is prescribed, depending on whether the offence concerns a supplementary licence or not. For the former, the maximum punishment is $10,000 fine for a first offence, and for a subsequent offence, a fine of up to $20,000 or 12 months’ imprisonment or both.
 
 As for other licences and documents, the maximum punishment is a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment of 12 months or both.
 
 The maximum punishment has been revised through the years.
17.
      
 In one of these cases, 
PP v Robert Luk Tai Kong
 MA 298/96/01, a fine of $1,000 was imposed for an offence under s 129 Road Traffic Act.
 
 While 
Robert Luk
 bears a superficial similarity with the present case in that the consequence of the criminal act was an evasion of payment for one day, I did not find that the reasoning in 
Robert Luk
 applied here, both in view of the offence charged and the greater culpability flowing from the criminal act of forgery. Furthermore, in the earlier case of In 
Sujatha Jayaram v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 410
, a sentence of
 
 two weeks’ imprisonment was upheld by the Honourable the Chief Justice.
  
 Similar sentences were imposed in a series of other cases involving contravention of s 129(2), such as 
Ashok Kumar Giri v PP
 MA 430/93/01, 
PP v Siow Chee Kiong
 MA 362/94/01, 
PP v Quah Siat Yong
 MA 163/94/01 and 
Eng Chiew Tee v PP
 MA 73/95/01.
   
 The exceptions were 
Lau Suan Liat Charlie v PP
 MA 168/97/01, in which there was no revenue loss, and 
Hassan bin Sulong v PP
 MA 175/97/01, in which the accused had apparently an exemplary public service record.
18.
      
 In the end, I was of the view that these cases offered limited guidance, as these were not concerned with charges under s 465 or other forms of forgery.
    
 The culpability of a person convicted under s 465 is greater than that of a person convicted under s 129 RTA, and should be dealt with accordingly.
 
 Furthermore, the range of punishment prescribed by the RTA was also lower than that under s 465.
19.
      
 In comparison to the RTA cases, there is also the case of 
 
 Wong Kum Meng
, in which 12 months’ imprisonment was imposed by the District Court on a charge under s 466 of using as genuine a forged road tax disc, although admittedly the appeal in that case lapsed.
20.
      
 The factors highlighted thus show that a 
 
 fine is not a sufficient punishment. The conduct of the Appellant was of a degree calling for the greater punishment and deterrence in a term of imprisonment.
 
 
  
 The present case was not a situation where a fine was merited because either there was no intent to cause harm, or only minimal harm was caused.
 
 While it is true that the loss in the end was small, being in the end only a day’s parking charges, the aggravating factors noted above meant that the small loss suffered could not decide the matter.
    
 The need for deterrence and the degree of culpability displayed by the other circumstances of the offence outweighed the fact that the loss was not that large.
21.
      
 Furthermore, although a deterrent sentence could take the form of a high fine, as stated in the case of
 
 
PP v Cheong Hock Lai
 
[2004] SGHC 122
, a securities case, it was not appropriate here.
  
 Imposing a fine only, even a maximum fine of $10,000, would to my mind, have sent an entirely wrong signal, and not sufficiently deterred similar acts of forgery.
The duration of imprisonment
22.
      
 However, while imprisonment was called for, I was of the view that a substantial term of imprisonment was not necessary in the circumstances.
 
23.
      
 As noted above, the Appellant was not charged with an offence under s 466 or s 468, both of which carried much longer terms.
 
 I took into account that the maximum punishment that could be imposed was 2 years’ imprisonment.
24.
      
 I noted that the monetary value of the subject matter of the forgery was also not large – it was some $88 odd.
 
 Furthermore, the forgery was detected a day after it was created.
 
 The actual gain by the Appellant was therefore minimal.
25.
      
 There was also the fact of the plea of guilt.
  
 The Accused did not have any previous conviction.
 
 That obviated the need for any additional specific deterrent against him personally, and showed his good character up to the time of the commission of the offence.
 
 On the other hand, as noted in a number of cases, such as 
PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet
 
[2000] SGHC 285
 
 
 
 
 the plea of guilt and lack of antecedents would 
 
 only amount to neutral factors in the face of the need for deterrence.
26.
      
 The mitigation made by the Appellant did not raise any other matters calling for leniency, aside from his clean record.
 
 For instance, the difficulties faced in relation to his family and personal finance were matters of personal hardship which had no effect on the sentence to be passed.
   
 In 
Tan Fook Sum,
 the Honourable the Chief Justice noted at para 31:
… The position is that hardship caused to the family by way of financial loss occasioned by imprisonment is of little weight today; and of no weight if the term is short: 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
 at p 928. Hardship because of other family circumstances is also disregarded. Such hardship is the price which the convicted person must bear and cannot affect what would otherwise be the right sentence: 
R v Ingham
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 184 as cited in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
 at p 308. Although ensuing hardship may exceptionally mitigate the rigour of punishment, the circumstances must be exceptional before the court will decide against a custodial sentence on this ground. Clearly, the circumstances of this case fell far short of those required to qualify hardship as a mitigating factor sufficient to persuade the court not to impose a custodial sentence.
27.
      
 In the present case, there was nothing in the Appellant’s personal or familial circumstances that was exceptional and called
 
 for an exception to the general rule that these were immaterial in sentencing.
    
 That the parking label was for the Appellant’s sister’s car
 
 is immaterial, since the Appellant had the use of the vehicle, according to the SOF.
 
28.
      
 What mitigatory factors there were were not so strong that they negated the need for a term of imprisonment to be imposed for the reasons above.
 
 However, they did point against a substantial term. In this context I bore in mind the need to ensure that the deterrent effect required did not lead to a sentence so heavy that it was unjust against the Appellant: 
Xia Qin Lai
.
 
 
 
Conclusion
29.
      
 All in all then, balancing the factors in favour of imprisonment, with these factors in favour of the appellant, I was of the view that a punishment of several weeks’ imprisonment was sufficient to both deter and adequately punish the criminal act.
 
 Anything less than four to six weeks would to my mind not constitute sufficient deterrence, in view of the factors discussed earlier.
 
 On the other hand, anything in the range of several months appeared to be disproportionate given the amount involved and the absence of any other criminal conviction.
   
 In the end therefore, I was satisfied that a term of
 
 6 weeks imprisonment balanced adequately all these considerations.
Bail pending appeal
30.
      
 Subsequent to the passing of sentence, the Appellant appealed my decision, while he was on bail pending his surrender to the Court. In view of his appeal, I granted him bail pending appeal in the same amount.",2005-05-26 00:00:00,SG District Court

The Appeal
 
 
1                      The accused pleaded guilty before me on 5 May 2005, to one charge under section 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224), of causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide.  The negligent act alleged consisted of the accused having failed to keep a proper look-out when turning right along the junction of Bedok Reservoir Road and Bedok North Road at about 10.08 am on 14 June 2004, thereby colliding into the deceased who was then “cycling along the pedestrian crossing crossing from the right to the left of [the accused’s] perspective”.
 
 The accused was convicted on his plea of guilt and fined $6,000.  He was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 5 years.  The accused has paid the fine.  He now appeals against the sentence.  The notice of appeal does not indicate whether the accused is appealing against the fine or the order of disqualification (or both). 
The facts
3                      According to the statement of facts admitted by the accused, on 14 June 2004 at about 10.08 am, he had been driving his motor lorry YG 6230 E along Bedok Reservoir Road.  The traffic flow at the material time was moderate; the weather was fine; and the road surface was dry.  On reaching the signalized junction of Bedok Reservoir Road and Bedok North Road, the accused had negligently failed to keep a proper look-out while turning right onto Bedok North Road; and as a result, he had collided into the deceased, one Abd Rahman bin Naim.  At the material time, the deceased was cycling along the pedestrian crossing, from the accused’s right to his left.  On the accused’s lorry colliding into him, the deceased fell onto the pedestrian crossing and later died in hospital at 4.06 pm the same day.  The cause of death was certified as severe head injury, consistent with injuries sustained from a road traffic accident.  The deceased’s blood sample was found to have contained codeine, lignocaine, metoclopramide and morphine, while his urine sample was found to have contained codeine, lignocaine, and metoclopramide.  The forensic pathologist and the medical officer attending the case opined that these drugs were of therapeutic origin; further, that they had been within therapeutic limits and were of no significance in the causation of death.
4                      Neither the accused’s lorry nor the deceased’s bicycle were found to have had any inherent defects.  The traffic lights at the junction were not found to have been faulty or malfunctioning at the time of the accident.
5                      In mitigation, defence counsel stated that the accused had turned into Bedok North Road
 
when the traffic light was green in his favour and after he had waited for traffic from the opposite direction to pass.  Counsel submitted that the accused had not been able to spot the deceased in time because the deceased must have been “coming from an inconspicuous angle, going against the general direction of traffic, and partially shielded from the last vehicle that passed”.  The accused alighted from his lorry to check on the deceased immediately after the collision.  He expressed remorse over the deceased’s death.
6                      The accused, who is married with 2 adult children, is also said to be running a small metal engineering business.  He ferries his workers and delivers materials in his lorry.  He asked to be allowed to retain his driving licence because he needed it for his business.  A letter from the Traffic Police dated 18 November 2003 was produced to show that the accused had maintained a clean driving record between 1 October 1998 and 30 September 2003.
The reasons for the sentence
7                      In passing sentence, I noted that in cases under the negligent limb of s 304A of the Penal Code where the cause of death is a traffic accident, the sentences imposed by the district courts on first offenders who plead guilty have tended to consist of fines in the range of $5,000 to $8,000, as well as orders for the accused’s disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles.  These disqualification periods have generally tended to start at around 5 years for first offenders.
8                      In 
PP v Yee King Poh
 
[2004] SGDC 168
, for instance, the accused pleaded guilty midway through a trial, to a charge under the negligent limb of s 304A.  The accused, who had been driving a lorry at the material time, admitted having caused the death of the driver of a motor car by encroaching upon the double white lines drawn on Raffles Boulevard when emerging from Temasek Boulevard into Raffles Boulevard, thereby causing a collision between his lorry and the deceased’s car.  The accused was a first offender who was a driver by occupation.  In mitigation, the accused produced evidence from accident re-constructionists to show that the deceased had been driving in excess of the speed limit at the material time.  The deceased was also alleged to have been “racing” with other drivers at the time.  The deceased’s blood and urine samples were found to have contained ethanol as well as drugs such as nimetazepam (a Class ‘C’ controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act) and nordiazepam.  The toxicologist reported that the drugs found in the deceased’s blood and urine samples might have impaired his driving ability but were “not directly related to the cause of death”, which was certified as “left haemothorax due to ruptured aorta and pulmonary artery”.  These were injuries consistent with those sustained in a traffic accident.  In sentencing the accused, the learned district judge opined that there was no evidence to show that the deceased’s driving ability had in fact been impaired by the drugs consumed; and that even if the deceased had affected by the drugs and had been speeding, the accused – had he been paying attention - should still have seen or heard the deceased’s car approaching.  The fact that the accused had failed to notice the deceased at all merely confirmed that he had failed to keep a proper look-out or to exercise proper care and caution when turning onto Raffles Boulevard
.  The accused was fined $7,000 and disqualified for 5 years from driving all classes of vehicles.  He appealed against the sentence but the appeal was dismissed on 2 September 2004.
9                      In 
PP v Teo Poh Leng
 
[1992] 1 SLR 15
, the accused – a first offender - pleaded guilty to a charge under the negligent limb of s 304A.  She had caused the death of 2 persons by failing to exercise proper control of her car, thereby causing it to skid and lose control when negotiating a bend.  The car collided into the two deceased who were then walking on the pavement.  On appeal, the High Court imposed on the accused a fine of $10,000 and disqualified her from driving all classes of vehicles for life.
10                    Even in cases where the court has felt that the deceased person contributed substantially to the accident, the sentences imposed have still consisted of both fines and disqualification orders, although in such exceptional cases the sentencing court has imposed a lower range of fines and a shorter period of disqualification.  In 
PP v Teng Syn Kok
 MA 77/2000/01, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under the negligent limb of section 304A.  He had driven into a traffic light junction when the light was in his favour.  On seeing the deceased then crossing at the pedestrian crossing despite the pedestrian crossing light being against her, the accused had sounded his horn to alert the deceased and had then attempted to pass her on the right.  Unfortunately the deceased continued to move across the road, which resulted in the accused colliding into her.  The learned district judge opined that in trying to pass the deceased on the right after horning instead of giving way to her, the accused had committed an error in judgement, but that his culpability “was on the lower end of the scale”: this was not, for example, a case where the accused had failed to keep a proper look-out.  The accused was fined $2,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a year.  The prosecution initially filed an appeal against the sentence but later discontinued the appeal.
 
11                    
PP v Siti Zubaidah bte Salleh
 MA 19503/2000 was another case heard before the same learned district judge who dealt with 
Teng Syn Kok’s
 case (above).  In that case, the accused also pleaded guilty to a charge under the negligent limb of s 304A.  A first offender and a mother of 2 teenage children, she had been driving along Jurong East Street 13 when she approached a pedestrian signalised crossing.  As she reached the crossing, the traffic light changed from red to green in her favour.  She was then traveling within the speed limit of 50 kmph.  The deceased had suddenly run out across the road in contravention of the pedestrian crossing light which was then against her.  The deceased encroached into the accused’s path, leading to a collision.  The learned district judge opined that whilst the accused had erred in failing to keep a proper look-out for errant pedestrians such as the deceased, her culpability was “on the lowest end of the scale”.  He imposed a fine of $1,000 and disqualified her from driving all classes of vehicles for a year.  The prosecution filed an appeal against the sentence but later withdrew the appeal.
12                    In the present case, I took into account the mitigating value of the accused’s plea of guilt and his clean record.  However, in respect of counsel’s contention at one point that the deceased must have been crossing the pedestrian crossing when the crossing light was against him, I noted that this contention was not supported by the statement of facts or by any other evidence.  In any event, even assuming for the sake of argument that the deceased had been moving against the pedestrian crossing light, the accused had - on his own admission - failed to notice the deceased at all.  This was in spite of the fact that the deceased was riding a bicycle at the time and would thus have been moving at a height more elevated than that of the normal pedestrian.  Comparing the present case with the two “exceptional” cases of 
Teng Syn
 Kok and 
Siti
 Zubaidah, where the deceased persons were plainly seen as having contributed substantially to the accidents, this was not a case where the accused’s culpability could be said to be on the lower end of the scale.  It was also not a case which had such exceptional facts as to warrant either non-imposition of a disqualification period or imposition of a disqualification period much shorter than the prevailing norm.  In this respect, it is apposite to recall the comments made by the High Court in 
PP v Poh Teck Huat
 
[2003] 2 SLR 299
.
  Whilst this was a road traffic case under the rash limb of s 304A, the High Court’s comments (reproduced below) apply equally to road traffic cases under the negligent limb of s 304A:
… the motor car is clearly a potentially lethal device. Thus any driver who gets behind the wheel must appreciate the responsibility placed upon his shoulders. Such accidents are totally avoidable and such loss of life needless…
Conclusion
13                    Taking into account the circumstances of the present collision, the mitigating factors and the sentencing precedents, I was of the view that a fine of $6,000 and a disqualification period of 5 years would be appropriate in this case.",2005-06-16 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge Aedit Abdullah
1
         
 The Appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted of one count of forgery, under s 465 Penal Code for which he was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment and fined $10,000, in default, 3 months’ imprisonment.
 
 Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.
 
 The Appellant being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the reasons are now given.
The charge
2
         
 The proceeded charge (PS 144 of 2005) against the Appellant reads:
You, Leonard Chin Tze Jien (Male/28 years), NRIC No. S7624012D, are charged that you, on or about 4 January 2004 in Singapore, forged a certain document to wit, a reseller agreement (recruitment of students) for the territory of Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China, between Informatics Holdings Limited and one Tan Chee Meng dated 31 December 2003 that was valued at S$500,000, with the intention of causing it to be believed that the said agreement was signed by one Tan Chee Meng which you knew was not true, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 465 Penal Code Cap 224, 1985 Revised Edition.
The facts
3
         
 The material portions of the Statement of Facts admitted by the Appellant reads as follows:
2.
        
 At the material time, on or about 4 January 2004, the [Appellant] was a principal consultant of PurpleTrain.com. Pte Ltd (“Purple Train”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Informatics Holdings Ltd (“Informatics”).
3.
        
 As a principal consultant, the [Appellant] had to market licences of Informatics, which gave the licensees the right to recruit students for PurpleTrain courses in certain foreign countries.
Background
4.
        
 Investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department revealed that the [Appellant] first approached his friend, one Tan Chee Meng (“Tan”) on or around September 2003 to market licences from Informatics.
 
 Tan, was not keen on entering into any licencing agreement with Informatics but agreed to help the Accused market the licenses to his other friends.
5.
        
 On 22 December 2003, the [Appellant] reported to Informatics that he would be bringing in five deals totalling $1.75 million for that quarter.
 
 However, the deals did not materialise and by 29 December 2003, the [Appellant] knew that none of Tan’s friends were keen on entering into any licensing agreement with Informatics and it was impossible to close deals.
 
 The [Appellant] thus reported to Ong Boon Kheng (“Ong”), the Chief Executive Officer of Informatics that he had lost the deals.
 
 Ong then insisted that the Accused closed the deals.
6.
        
 The [Appellant] thus asked a friend, one Seng Phey Zhen to lend him two pre-signed blank cheques assuring her that they would not be banked in.
 
 The [Appellant] then filled in amounts of $100,000 and $50,000 on the cheques and submitted them to Informatics to represent the amounts as deposits for the licensing and franchise deals.
 
 However, the Finance Manager of Global Franchise and Licensing Sales in Informatics, one Loke Chee Kwong, could not recognise the revenue based on the cheques alone and asked the [Appellant] for the agreements and supporting details.
Facts relating to PS 144 of 2005
7.
        
 On or about 4 January 2004, the [Appellant] prepared a reseller agreement (recruitment of students) for the territory of Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China, between Informatics and Tan, dated 31 December 2003, valued at S$500,000 by using a soft copy of the reseller agreement that he had in his office laptop computer.
8.
        
 A day later, the [Appellant] forged Tan’s signature on the reseller agreement and faxed the forged reseller agreement from his home to Loke Chee Kwong.
 
 The [Appellant] had forged Tan’s signature on the reseller agreement with the intention of causing the reseller agreement to be believed as genuine with the intention of causing the reseller agreement to be believed as genuine and signed by Tan, a fact he knew was not true.
 
 The forged reseller agreement was included in the third quarter of financial year 2004 results for Infomatics and boosted their sales by S$350,000, as Informatics recognised 70% of the value of the deal upon receipt of a 10% deposit of $50,000 deposit from the client.
9.
        
 The [Appellant] had thereby committed an offence of forgery under Section 465 Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Revised Edition).
Antecedents
4
         
 The Appellant was convicted of three charges concerning traffic violations, with another taken into consideration.
 
 He had no property offence convictions.
 
Mitigation
5
         
 A written mitigation plea was tendered by Counsel for the Appellant.
 
 This mitigation plea related the circumstances and facts surrounding the commission of the offence.
 
 These facts, which did not qualify the plea, were not disputed by the Prosecution.
 
6
         
 It was related that although the Appellant wanted to resign from Informatics, the CEO, Ong, and the Senior Vice-President, Mr Lim Wee Kee, persuaded him to stay on to see if he could help Informatics hit its sales targets.
 
 The Appellant was constantly reminded of the need to meet targets, specifically by bringing in 4 reseller agreements with Tan.
 
 As it turned out, no reseller agreements could be concluded. The Appellant informed Ong that the deals would not transpire in time for these to be reported in the 3
rd
 quarter. According to the mitigation plea, Ong’s reaction was to insist that the deals be closed, and stated that the sales had been announced to the Board of Directors.
 
 The Appellant felt obliged to help with the targets, though he had no financial incentive, as Ong had groomed him and nurtured his career.
 
 The Appellant also said that he felt pressured to help.
7
         
 As recounted in the Statement of Facts, the Appellant obtained two blank cheques from a friend, filled in the sums payable, and handed these to a Finance Manager in Informatics, telling the latter not to bank the cheques in.
 
 Upon getting reminders for the submission of the reseller agreements, the Appellant signed 4 reseller agreements as Tan, and faxed the signature page to Informatics’ office.
   
 The Appellant thought that by only submitting the reseller agreements, without any payments since the cheques were not to be banked in, the deal would not be recognised and no loss suffered.
  
 Subsequently, the Appellant informed Lim that the deal was off and attempted to retrieve the submitted documents. However he was then told that the sales had been included in Informatics’ books. The Appellant was subsequently dismissed from Informatics’ employment.
8
         
 In mitigation, the Appellant pointed to his good character in the armed forces. He also related his employment history, and his rise through the ranks at Informatics.
   
 Testimonials were attached to the mitigation.
    
 Specific mitigatory factors were relied upon by the Appellant.
 
 It was said that the Appellant was remorseful as evidenced by his attempt to immediately retract the documents submitted, and his confession.
 
 The Appellant had also co-operated with the CAD in investigations into the financial irregularities at Informatics, and has stated his intention to assist and testify against any officer of Informatics in respect of the financial irregularities.
 
 The Appellant had not obtained any personal benefit from the act, particularly in terms of any commission.
 
 The criminal acts were committed not out of personal interest, but were the result of foolishness and impulsiveness, caused by the pressures he felt were being exerted by Ong and his sense of obligation to the latter.
 
 No planning went in to the criminal acts, and no actual loss was caused.
 
 Although Informatics inflated its sales revenue and made a public announcement following his act, this should not be held against the Appellant.
 
 Informatics should not in the circumstances have declared the revenue in question.
 
9
         
 The Appellant had no previous antecedents for offences involving dishonesty; his only previous conviction was for traffic offences. 
 
 It was said that he was and is a young man with a promising future ahead of him.
10
       
 Counsel referred to the case of 
PP v Wang Xiao Hui
 [
[2004] SGDC 301
, in which the accused was sentenced to a fine of $7,000 o n each of two charges, one for dishonestly signing an application form for replacement of a card, and another for dishonestly inducing the bank to deliver a sum of $10,000.
 
 It was said that a similarity between that case and the present was that the accused there and the Appellant had both attempted to help another person and had not obtained any financial benefit.
 
11
       
 The Appellant sought the imposition of a fine only.
 
 The Appellant feared a custodial sentence as it would hurt his future prospects.
 
The Prosecution
12
       
 The Prosecution did not submit on sentence.
The Sentence imposed
13
       
 The sentence imposed was 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000, with 3 months’ imprisonment in default.
 
14
       
 The primary consideration in sentencing was the magnitude of the crime.
 
 Though there was no financial gain to the Appellant, the document in question could only be described as having great financial significance in view of the amount disclosed and the transaction represented by it. 
  
 The amount disclosed on the face of the forged document in the proceeded charge was some half a million dollars. 
 
 It is true the amount does have to be taken in context, and weighed against the absence of financial gain to the accused person and direct financial loss to the victim or victims. While in some circumstances the lack of financial loss to the victim or gain to the accused would be of little weight in sentencing, see for example
  
 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] SGHC 157
, in other instances, such as in 
Tan Puay Boon v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 186
, financial gain would be a pertinent factor.
 
 In respect of a charge of forgery, such financial gain would be relevant, and it would be of some mitigatory weight here that the Appellant did not reap any financial gain himself.
 
 There was also no indication in the statement of fats of direct financial loss
 
 to Informatics.
  
 Nonetheless,
 
 the forgery of a document representing such a high value transaction must attract a sentence that adequately punishes and deters similar acts.
15
       
 Furthermore, as admitted by the Appellant in his plea of guilt in answer to the charge, and in the Statement of Facts, the Appellant wanted the reseller agreement to be believed as genuine.
 
 Given this intention and desire, his culpability is therefore substantial, even if no financial gain was derived or intended to be derived.
 
16
       
 What was also material in sentencing was that there were three other charges being taken into consideration.
 
 I noted that these charges concerned acts which came about through the one transaction:
 
 the Appellant did not return to the criminal act repeatedly on several
 
 separate occasions, which otherwise would have meant a substantial increase in the sentence imposed.
 
 Nonetheless, the sentence imposed on the proceeded charge had to reflect that there were these other documents that were forged and were the subject of criminal charges:
 
 see 
PP
 
 v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1998] SGHC 306
.
 
17
       
 Counsel raised the issue whether the recognition of the transaction in the financial report should be considered in sentencing. It was argued the Appellant did not know or anticipate that the company would include the transaction in the report, and had attempted in fact to guard against it by specifying that the cheque ostensibly representing payment was not to be banked in.
 
 Whether or not the transactions should have been reflected in the report was not an issue properly before me and 
 
 the consequences of the financial reporting would probably have to be worked out another day in another forum.
  
 However, I was of the view that in the present case it was important to focus on the culpability of the Appellant
 
 in what he actually did – namely the forging of a document, intending to have it believed that it was genuine.
   
 The subsequent effect of the document here could not to my mind be determinative in sentencing.
 
 The result may however be different in other factual situations, involving other charges.
 
18
       
 Although not directly invoked in the mitigation, it could be argued that the Appellant’s sentence should reflect that his criminal act could not in the end succeed as the company would have discovered the forgery sooner or later.
 
 In 
Nomura Taiji v PP
 
[1998] SGHC 19
, the learned Chief Justice noted that the lack of likelihood of success meant that the sentence imposed need not be proportionate to the amount involved, especially if this is very high.
 
 It follows from that case that here the Appellant should not be given a heavy sentence just because of the sum of money mentioned in the documents especially since his criminal act would not have had any likelihood of success.
 
 However, it did not follow, and 
Nomura
 is not authority for the proposition, that in such cases of impossibility the accused should be treated wholly leniently.
   
 A sentence reflecting the actual criminal conduct still had to be imposed.
19
       
 In favour of the Appellant were the absence of similar antecedents, general good conduct as well as the fact that the Appellant had pleaded guilty, and had confessed to his acts. These were of some mitigatory weight.
  
 The Appellant also referred to his co-operation with CAD and his willingness to assist in respect of any proceedings against others.
 
 Co-operation can be a mitigating factor, depending on the precise circumstances.
 
 In the present case, some mitigatory credit was already given for his early renunciation of his criminal acts, and I did not think that there could be much more credit given, when weighed against his culpability.
 
20
       
 Counsel relied upon the case of 
PP v Wang Xiao Hu
 
[2004] SGDC 301
, arguing that the mitigating factors in that case, namely the lack of financial benefit and the motivation in seeking to help another person, were also present in the instant case and that a similar sentence of a fine only should be imposed.
   
 I was of the view that the case was not apposite.
 
 That case concerned the submission of a forged application form.
 
 The accomplice of the accused had convinced the accused to impersonate the holder of a bank account, and to forge the holder’s signature.
 
 The accused in her mitigation said that she had committed the offences in her belief that the accomplice was helping the account holder, who was overseas.
   
 While the accomplice was sentenced to a total of 10 months’ imprisonment, the learned district judge in 
Wang Xiao Hu
 found that the accused did not benefit financially and had committed the offences to help another, and thus imposed fines only.
 
 The case of 
Soh Puay Luan v PP
 [MA 383/93/01] was referred to in the grounds of decision; that case involved an accused who had similarly not benefited and had committed the crimes to help another.
 
 A sentence of three months’ imprisonment was reduced on appeal to a total fine of $5,000.
 
 The reasons for reduction of sentence in 
Soh Puay Luan
 do not appear to have been reported.
 
21
       
 Upon reading the decision in 
Wang Xiao Hu
, I could not accept Counsel’s contentions that it assisted in the present case.
 
 I
 
 do not read 
Wang Xiao Hu
 
 
 as elevating assistance to another as a mitigating factory in its own right.
 
 Rather that case turned on the culpability of the accused, who was misled by her accomplice.
 
 I also read the case as decided largely on the issue of absence of personal gain.
 
 While such absence of a personal gain is a pertinent factor in the present case, it was in the end outweighed by the magnitude of the criminal act, namely the forging of a document representing a large transaction.
 
 The nature of the documents forged was also another material and significant difference between 
Wang Xiao Hui
 and the present appeal.
 
22
       
 In any event, even if assistance to another was a mitigatory factor, it would not assist the Appellant here, since the act of forgery was targeted at the very persons and the company whom he supposedly wished to help.
 
 There is no reduction in culpability here.
 
 I could see no reason why a sentence should be reduced because the appellant was motivated to commit the crime because of the assistance he thought he was giving to the victim by that criminal act.
 
 
   
 It evidences muddle-headedness and a lack of judgment, but these by themselves do not reduce the level of culpability.
   
 They may point to the absence of gain, or intention to obtain gain, but this absence of profit can be weighed as a mitigatory factory on its own, as I had done here.
 
23
       
 Bearing in mind the above, I determined the sentence to be imposed.
 
 This had to be proportional to the criminal culpability of the Appellant.
 
 Sentences of fines only have been imposed for convictions under s 465, but most of these have involved minor documents, or low value.
 
 The Appellant here had not forged an invoice or purchase order reflecting a small sum of money.
 
 He had forged a document dealing with a substantial sum, and in respect of a commercially important transaction.
  
 Given the nature of the document and what it purported to be, I concluded in the end, bearing in mind the factors noted above, that a fine alone, even a high one, was not adequate.
 
 Some sentence of imprisonment should be imposed, not only to punish the criminal act, but to deter similar acts of forgery for whatever ultimate purpose.
   
24
       
 In determining the length of imprisonment, I was of the view that a sentence of only a few weeks would have been inappropriate given the magnitude of the criminal act.
 
 On the other hand, the absence of financial gain, his plea of guilt and the otherwise clean record, apart from the traffic offences, meant that the sentence should not be so substantial that it would be unjust.
 
 I also took into account that the monetary figure while large was not wholly determinative.
 
 The present case was not one that called for a sentence of the duration imposed in cases such as 
Tan Kiang Kwang v P
 
[1995] SGHC 265
, where one year’s imprisonment was imposed on each of three charges.
 
25
       
 In the circumstances, I concluded therefore that a relatively short imprisonment of several months coupled with a fine would adequately address these competing concerns. Assessing all the matters above, I thus imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 (with three months’ imprisonment in default of payment).
26
       
 The start of the sentence of imprisonment was initially deferred by one week after I pronounced the sentence.
 
 However, following the filing of the appeal, I granted the Appellant bail pending appeal.",2005-06-21 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge Wong Choon Ning:
1         
 The first accused (Rohaizad Bin Suadi) claimed trial to the following re-amended charge :-
DAC 25280/2004 (Exh. 
P1B
)
“You,
ROHAIZAD BIN SUADI, M/29 YRS
NRIC : S7503447-D
SINGAPORE CITIZEN
are charged that you, on the 27
th
 day of May 2004, at or about 3.00 am, along Coleman Street, Singapore, together with Aziz Bin Said, Abdul Hadi Bin Jumri, Rizal Bin Hassan, and 3 unknown male persons, were members of an unlawful assembly, whose common object was to cause hurt to one Chaudhry Muhammad Jawad UR Rehman and in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, you or some members, did use violence and caused hurt to the said Chaudhry Muhammad Jawad UR Rehman, to wit, by fisting and kicking him, and you have thereby committed an offence of rioting punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”
2          The first accused was jointly tried with the second accused (Rizal bin Hassan) who faced a similar charge for rioting (Exh. 
P2B
).
3          At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the first accused beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly I acquitted the first accused on the rioting charge. I was, however, satisfied that a charge for using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code had been made out against the first accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The first accused was accordingly convicted on the following charge drawn under the Court’s hand :-
DAC 25280/2004 (Exh. 
B

“You,
ROHAIZAD BIN SUADI, M/29 YRS
NRIC : S7503447-D
SINGAPORE CITIZEN
are charged that you, on the 27
th
 day of May 2004, at or about 3.00 am, along the corridor on the ground floor of Peninsula Plaza, Coleman Street, did use criminal force to one Chaudhry Muhammad Jawad UR Rehman, otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by the said Chaudhry Muhammad Jawad UR Rehman, to wit, by pushing your elbow against his stomach, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 352 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”
4          As for the second accused, I found that the prosecution had proven its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt and he was accordingly convicted on the rioting charge.
5          For the offence of using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code, the first accused was fined $500 or in default one week’s imprisonment. The fine was paid in full.
6          The prosecution is dissatisfied with the order of acquittal on the charge under Section 147 of the Penal Code, and the orders of conviction and sentence on the charge under Section 352 and now appeals against them. There is no appeal against the orders of conviction and sentence for the second accused by both the prosecution and the defence.
Prosecution’s case
7          A total of nine witnesses were called to give oral evidence by the prosecution. An account of how the assault had occurred was given by the victim and a security guard who had witnessed the entire incident. The prosecution also called five witnesses who had been at the scene at the material time. Two of them, in particular, had participated in the assault on the victim and they gave testimony on the assault and the first accused’s role in the whole incident. The remaining two witnesses, namely, the Investigation Officer and a chief security officer, were essentially formal witnesses, through whom the first and second accused persons’ cautioned statements and a tape recording of part of the incident were admitted in evidence.
Evidence of the Victim and the Security Guard
8          On 27 May 2004, at around 3 am, one Chaudhry Muhammad Jawad (
PW 2
) (hereinafter referred to as “the victim”) was walking along the corridor on the ground floor of Peninsula Plaza. He had just spent about an hour with his friends at a pub in Boat Quay and was then on his way home.
9          After crossing Coleman Street, from Funan Centre, the victim was outside the SK Store in Peninsula Plaza, near to the 7-Eleven Store, when the first accused bumped into him. At that time, the first accused was alone.
[1]
 
The first accused looked angry and pushed his elbow on the victim’s stomach
[2]
. Standing very closely to him
[3]
, the first accused held the victim by the shirt and asked him in English, “Are you drunk?”.
[4]
 
Apart from this, the first accused did not do anything else. He did not hit or beat the victim.
[5]
10        This episode between the first accused and the victim was witnessed by a security guard, Borhanudin bin Buang (
PW 2
) (hereinafter referred to as “Borhanudin”), who was then resting near a palm tree (at the spot marked as “X” in photo 
P42)
, about 8 to 10 steps away from them.
[6]
 
His attention having been drawn to the commotion, Borhanudin started to walk towards the victim and the first accused (who were around the spot marked as “Y1” in photo 
P43
).
11        Borhanudin then noticed another man approach the victim and straightaway punch the latter. This second man had come from somewhere outside the corridor (which is shown as the background of the lower right frame of photo 
P28)
.
[7]
 
This second man had not come from the group of men who had been with Borhanudin earlier near the palm tree.
[8]
  Borhanudin’s evidence was that, at this stage, there was no other man involved with the victim, the first accused and the second man.
[9]
12        The victim then saw some other people who were in the vicinity move towards him.
[10]
 
Fearing for his own safety, he turned and ran away in the direction towards Funan Centre. As he ran, the victim did not look back to see who were chasing him. Along Coleman Street, he was pushed or punched or slapped by someone from behind
[11]
, causing him to fall face downwards in the middle of the road. The victim could not say who had hit him from behind.
13        In the meantime, Borhanudin had also followed the victim.
[12]
 
But there was an interval when he lost sight of the victim, as the victim was running and Borhanudin was only walking after him.
[13]
 
He hence did not see the victim fall down
[14]
 
and could not say how he had fallen down
[15]
. He also did not see who had hit the victim from behind.
14        By the time Borhanudin reached Coleman Street, the victim was already lying on the road.
[16]
 
A group of men surrounded the victim, kicking and punching him.
[17]
 
The assault occurred around the spot marked as “Y2” in photo 
P46
. After falling face downwards, the victim had turned and laid on his back, and he covered his face to protect himself. The victim who had his face covered estimated his group of assailants to be around eight men. Borhanudin, on the other hand, initially described the group as numbering more than ten men but, under cross-examination, reduced the figure to five or six men
[18]
.
15        During the group assault, Borhanudin did not approach the group but kept observations from a spot on the open-air pavement of Peninsula Plaza (in front of a pillar shown on the right side of photo 
P46
). At that time, the distance between the victim and Borhanudin was about the width of two car-lanes or, in Borhanudin’s own words, the equivalent of 5 steps. Borhanudin’s attention was focused on the victim and he did not take his eyes away from the victim until the assault stopped.
[19]
16        The victim could not identify those who had assaulted him or chased him. Borhanudin was also unable to identify those who had assaulted the victim.  As the place where the victim was assaulted was quite dim
[20]
, Borhanudin also could not tell if the first accused had also fallen down on the road.
[21]
17        The assault was over very quickly.
[22]
 
It lasted only a few seconds
[23]
 
before one of the men took the victim’s wallet and the group then moved towards the direction of Stamford Road.
[24]
 
It is not known why the men suddenly stopped beating the victim.
[25]
18        The victim did not seek medical attention for his injuries which consisted of a cut on the right cheek, a swelling on the forehead, bruises on the left forearm and a scratch near the knuckles on the right hand.
[26]
Evidence of two men who had participated in the group assault on the victim
19        Abdul Hadi bin Jumri (
PW 7
), who is also known as Topeng Ali or Topeng Hadi (hereinafter referred to as “Abdul Hadi”), was the man who had approached and punched the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza. Abdul Hadi testified that he and the first accused, together with a few other friends, had gone to Peninsula Plaza after a night out at the Chocolate Bar in Boat Quay.  Along the corridor, Abdul Hadi was waiting with a friend named Eddie for their friends who had gone into the 7-Eleven Store at Peninsula Plaza
[27]
, when he saw the first accused confront the victim and argue with him.
[28]
 
Subsequently, he saw the first accused push the victim. Wanting to help the first accused
[29]
, Abdul Hadi went to the victim and straightaway punched him.
20        The victim then ran towards Coleman Street. The first accused ran after him. There was a third man whom Abdul Hadi recognized to be one named “Papa” who also chased the victim. Abdul Hadi also joined in the chase.
21        When he reached Coleman Street, Abdul Hadi saw that the victim had already fallen onto the road. In re-examination, Abdul Hadi clarified that he actually did not know why the victim had fallen down. While he was running after the victim, he did not take note of what the first accused was doing.
[30]
 
Abdul Hadi was also unable to say who, between the first accused or “Papa”, was the one running ahead of the other.
[31]
22        Abdul Hadi testified that he did not ever see the first accused punch the victim during the chase.
[32]
 
He merely assumed that the first accused had punched the victim, causing the latter to fall, as he could recall someone mentioning something to this effect to him later that night, when he reunited with the first accused and their friends.
[33]
 
Abdul Hadi, however, could not recall who had said this to him.
23        Seeing the victim lying on the road, Abdul Hadi went and sat on the victim, between his waist and his stomach, and punched the victim’s face. The victim was then facing upwards and Abdul Hadi sat facing his head.
24        While sitting on the victim, Abdul Hadi turned around and saw that the first accused was looking for his watch.
[34]
 
While Abdul Hadi was in the midst of assaulting the victim, he saw the first accused running away.
[35]
 
After that, a group of men came and assaulted the victim.
[36]
 
By then, Abdul Hadi had already punched the victim about ten to eleven times.
[37]
25        The group of men assaulted the victim by kicking him. There were only four men in this group, namely, the second accused, Aziz bin Said (
PW 8
), Eddie and one An An.
[38]
 
Abdul Hadi had seen these four persons run forward to him and the victim.
[39]
 
In particular, he had taken special note of the second accused as he was the only one in the group with golden hair.
26        Subsequently, someone from the group shouted “Police”. The group dispersed from the scene. Abdul Hadi also ran away with Eddie. Whilst making his escape, Abdul Hadi came across two girls and stole their handphones. Abdul Hadi and Eddie eventually left the scene in a cab together.
27        Aziz bin Said (
PW 8
) (hereinafter referred to as “Aziz”) was a friend of the first accused and Abdul Hadi. He had participated in the group assault on the victim. Aziz testified that he was on the other side of the road, when he saw the first accused either push or punch the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza. Aziz could sense that there was a misunderstanding between the two
[40]
 
as this confrontation had taken place just after the victim and the first accused had bumped into each other.
[41]
28        All of a sudden, there was running and chasing taking place amidst a state of chaos. The first accused was among those chasing the victim. But Aziz did not notice who else was chasing the victim, as he himself also crossed the road and moved towards the victim who was running towards him.
29        By the time Aziz reached the victim, the latter was already on the ground. There were people surrounding the victim and beating him. Aziz gave the victim about two or three kicks and left. According to Aziz, he left hurriedly because he had just been released from prison a few weeks before the incident and he was afraid to be arrested again. He had nevertheless joined in the assault by kicking the victim, because he felt that he had to defend or help his friends. After giving a few kicks, his primary concern was to save himself first. Aziz hence ran away from the scene and took a taxi home.
30        Later in the night, the first accused and a few others came to Aziz’s house. This was because Aziz and his friends had earlier arranged at the Chocolate Bar that they would all go back to Aziz’s house after the night out at Boat Quay. At Aziz’s house, the first accused told Aziz that he had bumped into the victim earlier.
[42]
 
The first accused also informed Aziz that he had lost his wallet and everyone concentrated on helping the first accused to remember where he had left his wallet.
31        Abdul Hadi and Aziz were both arrested subsequently. They pleaded guilty to a charge for rioting arising from this incident. At the time of the trial, they were serving sentence for the offence.
Evidence of three women who were present at the scene
32        The prosecution also adduced evidence from three women who were part of the first accused’s group of friends and who had walked with him to Peninsula Plaza from the Chocolate Bar. All of them were, however, between 25 m and 35 m away from the victim when the group assault took place.
[43]
 
They also did not witness the initial confrontation between the first accused and the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza.
33        Salamah binte Yacob (
PW 5
) (hereinafter referred to as “Salamah”) was the second accused’s wife. Salamah gave evidence that she, her sister, the first and second accused persons, Abdul Hadi, Aziz and a female whom the first accused befriended at the Chocolate Bar had walked together to the 7-Eleven Store at Peninsula Plaza after spending time at the pub. Along their way there, they met three male friends of the second accused, two of whom were known as Eddie and An An. These three men then walked with them to Peninsula Plaza.
34        Upon reaching the 7-Eleven Store, Salamah went in to buy a packet of cigarettes. She came out and joined her sister and the other female who were both resting at a marble seat (shown in photo no. 5 in 
P8
) further down the road towards Stamford Road. The three ladies had a talk as they rested. A few minutes later, whilst she was talking to her sister and the other female, Salamah heard someone shout vulgarities in Malay directly behind her. At that time, Salamah was facing her sister and the other female and her body was turned more towards the direction of Stamford Road. At that time, in that position, Salamah would not have been able to see whatever was happening behind her, including anything that might have occurred along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza as shown in photo 
P5
.
35        Salamah turned around such that she now fully faced Funan Centre. Remaining at the same spot, Salamah saw a group of men surrounding someone who was lying on the road. They were then on Coleman Street, to her right,
[44]
 
and Salamah saw them through a small gap.
[45]
 
The men were kicking away. Salamah could not see the faces of any of these men as their backs were turned towards her.
[46]
 
Salamah nevertheless testified that she could say that two of them were the first and second accused persons respectively.
36        Salamah could not see who the other men in the group were but she assumed that Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie and An An must have been in the group. Salamah had observed the assault for a very short interval, about 30 seconds only.
[47]
 
She had quickly turned her head back away from the scene because she did not wish to see anything.
[48]
 
She did not want to see the fight
[49]
 
and she never turned back again to look
[50]
. About a minute later, Salamah heard the men shouting to the women to run. The second accused came to Salamah’s side and she, together with her husband and sister, later took a taxi home.
37        Subsequently, on 1 Jun 2004, both the second accused and Salamah were arrested and remanded in the police lock-up. Salamah testified that she was angry with the second accused for getting himself arrested and causing her to be placed in the lock-up.  Upon her release from the police station, she initiated divorce proceedings against the second accused.
38        Salamah’s sister, Siti Aishah bin Yacob (
PW 6
) (hereinafter referred to as “Siti Aishah”), was also present at the scene. She, however, did not witness the assault. Siti Aishah confirmed that, on the way to Peninsula Plaza, she, the first and second accused persons, Salamah, Abdul Hadi, Aziz and a female friend of the first accused  had been joined by three male friends of the second accused.
39        At Peninsula Plaza, Siti Aishah and the other female sat at a marble seat to wait for the rest who went into the 7-Eleven Store. Salamah later joined them at the marble seat. All the men in her group, including the three male friends of the second accused, sat at a place in front of the 7-Eleven Store. Siti Aishah and the other female were sitting at the marble seat in front of Peninsula Plaza and chatting for 10 to 15 minutes when suddenly the second accused came to them and shouted for them to run. Siti Aishah did not know what was going on. She simply followed the second accused and, together with Salamah, they left the scene and went home.
40        Siti Aishah was questioned at length on where the first accused was when the incident occurred. It was Siti Aishah’s evidence that she had not seen the first accused run past her. However, she indicated that, as she was then talking to the other female, if someone had run past her then towards Stamford Road, she might have missed seeing him as she did not really pay attention.
[51]
 
At the material time, she would be chatting with the other female who was seated on her right.
[52]
 
Further, at certain points, she could also have been talking over a handphone.
[53]
Indeed, whilst chatting with the other female, Siti Aishah did not ever hear the vulgarities in Malay which Salamah, who was standing just beside her, heard. Siti Aishah’s view of the passageway of Peninsula Plaza was also partially blocked by Salamah.
[54]
41        As for the other men who had come with her to Peninsula Plaza, Siti Aishah gave conflicting evidence as to whether she had seen them run towards the direction of Stamford Road.
[55]
42        Upon reaching home, Siti Aishah asked the second accused what had happened. The second accused told Siti Aishah that he had kicked the victim’s face. When Siti Aishah asked him why he had to do that, the second accused’s answer was, “My friend wanted to do so. I just help out.” The next day, the second accused showed Siti Aishah his right leg which was swollen, and told her that his friend would be bringing him to see the doctor later that day.
43        Salihah Mastdurah binte Akbar (
PW 4
) (hereinafter referred to as “Mas”) was the female whom the first accused had befriended at the Chocolate Bar on the night in question. Like Siti Aishah, she had not witnessed the initial incident along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza and the subsequent assault. Mas gave evidence that, when she heard a man shout “Run”, she just ran with a group of men which included Abdul Hadi and Aziz. Mas could not say who the rest of the men in this group were.
44        Mas then ran with Salamah and Siti Aishah behind Abdul Hadi and Aziz. They ran to a T-junction where Mas and Abdul Hadi split from the rest and walked down another road. Mas was subsequently picked up by the first accused in a taxi which had two other unknown men in it. In the taxi, whilst on the way to Aziz’s house, one of the unknown men sitting next to the first accused told the first accused that the wallet had been thrown away and that he had got only $10. The $10 was later used by Mas to pay for the taxi fare.
45        At Bedok, upon alighting from the taxi, the first accused went to a public telephone booth and tried to contact his friends. But Mas did not know whom the first accused was calling. According to Mas, at Aziz’s house, the first accused asked her in a boastful manner if she had seen him beating up the guy, to which she replied in the affirmative,
[56]
 
even though she had not seen him beat anyone.
46        On the following day, Mas went with the first accused and Aziz to meet the second accused at a coffeeshop near the latter’s flat. Dragging his leg, the second accused said that his foot was injured.  He did not, however, indicate how or when it had been injured.
[57]
 
He merely told the three of them that he did not know which guy had kicked his leg the day before.
[58]
Cautioned statements of the first and second accused persons
47        The prosecution adduced in evidence the cautioned statements (
P64
 and 
P65
) of both accused persons. The defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the statements. These statements had been given by the accused persons in answer to charges for gang robbery under Section 395 of the Penal Code. Both accused persons had originally been charged for being jointly concerned with Aziz and four other persons in robbing the victim of his possessions.
Other evidence
48        The prosecution also tendered a closed circuit television (CCTV) tape-recording (
P7
) which had captured the initial encounter between the first accused and the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza, but not the subsequent assault on the victim on Coleman Street. When played, the tape would display four pictures or images on the screen, which had been taken simultaneously from four cameras placed at different locations in Peninsula Plaza. The tape was a lapsed time recording using a camera recording in slow motion, such that events over a 24-hour period would be captured on a 3-hour video-tape. The recording for each day would usually commence at 9 pm.
49        When played using the multiplexer, the tape-recording would show a timing at the top right corner of the screen. This timing would normally reflect the actual time of the event recorded. However, for this particular recording, the timing for the recording had been programmed to be faster than the actual time. Hence, the tape showed the initial encounter between the first accused and the victim to have occurred around 4.02 am when, in reality, as shown by the first information report (
P63
), an anonymous male had already called the police at about 3.39 am to inform them of the fight at Peninsula Plaza. Nevertheless, the time interval between certain images as denoted by the timings on the top right corner of the screen would still accurately correspond to the actual time interval of the events captured by those images.
50        During the trial, owing to repeated viewing, the tape-recording became spoilt. Certain parts of the recording produced fuzzy images and one material portion of the tape was entirely skipped over during playback. For another portion, the timing shown at the top right corner was completely out of synchronization with reality in that a timing of 9:00 was shown for an image in between images from 3:59 to 4:02. The image appeared to be a fragment of an earlier recording made on the same tape. The tape-recording was subsequently restored and re-tendered in a video compact disc (VCD) format (
P7A
). The restored VCD-recording, when played, would not show any timing on the top right corner of the screen.
51        In the course of the trial, the prosecution also tendered a sketch-plan of the scene (
P62
) with measurements taken for the important landmark points identified by the witnesses. In addition, there were also photographs of the scene taken both shortly after the incident and during the trial itself, as well as photographs taken of the TV screen whilst the tape-recording was being played.
Defence’s case
52        Both the first and second accused persons elected to give evidence. There were no other defence witnesses.
Evidence of the first accused
53        The first accused, who is also known as “Izad”, gave evidence that, on the night of 26 May 2004, he and Abdul Hadi had, in response to the second accused’s invitation, gone to join him, his wife and Aziz at the coffeeshop near the second accused’s flat. This was a coffeeshop where they normally hung out. From 8.30 pm to sometime past 11 pm, the five of them engaged in a drinking session in which about ten bottles of beer and some Stout were consumed.
[59]
 
Thereafter, the first accused and Abdul Hadi wanted to move on to a pub at Boat Quay, and the second accused decided to come along with his wife. Before proceeding to the pub, the first accused borrowed one of the second accused’s shirts. It was a black long-sleeved T-shirt.
54        The first accused testified that, by the time he left the coffeeshop, he was already drunk although he could still walk on his own.
[60]
 
The rest of the group, including Salamah, also appeared drunk.
55        At the Chocolate Bar in Boat Quay, the five of them consumed another five to six jugs of Bourbon Coke.
[61]
 
A bottle of Martell brandy was also ordered but the first accused did not drink it.
56        At the pub, the first accused befriended Mas and brought her to join his party of friends. At about 2.45 am, the whole group left the pub. The first accused invited Mas to have supper with him at a nearby coffeeshop.
[62]
 
His friends also went along with him. By then, everyone in the first accused’s party of friends was more intoxicated than what they were earlier when they left the coffeeshop near the second accused’s house.
[63]
57        The first accused, together with Mas and Siti Aishah, moved on ahead of the group. But they found that the coffeeshop was crowded and hence headed back to the others. The first accused wanted to go out with Mas but the second accused said that they would walk to Peninsula Plaza first.
[64]
 
This was because the second accused wanted to see if, at Peninsula Plaza, they would come across any group which would cause them trouble, as a group had earlier assaulted his (the second accused’s) friends there.
[65]
 
The first accused testified that, at that time, he assumed that the second accused would himself confront the group if he were to meet this group of troublemakers.
[66]
 
He had no plan to assault anyone with the second accused.
58        Along the way to Peninsula Plaza, they came across a few of the second accused’s friends. These men were not previously known to the first accused.
[67]
59        The first accused testified that he, Abdul Hadi and Aziz were the first to arrive at Peninsula Plaza. The first accused went into the 7-Eleven Store to buy a packet of cigarettes. When he came out of the 7-Eleven Store, he realised that the second accused’s male friends had also come to Peninsula Plaza.
[68]
60        Subsequently, the first accused accompanied Mas into the 7-Eleven Store as she wanted to buy something.
[69]
 
After coming out of the 7-Eleven Store, Mas left to join Salamah and Siti Aishah at the marble seat.
[70]
 
There were some male Malays outside the 7-Eleven Store.
[71]
61        The first accused turned to his right and saw that the second accused was about to cross Coleman Street towards Funan Centre.
[72]
 
He then walked towards the second accused to find out his next destination, as he (the first accused) wanted to leave and bring Mas to another place.
[73]
 
However, whilst the first accused was walking towards the second accused, the victim bumped into him, in front of the SK Store at Peninsula Plaza. At that time, the first accused was under the mistaken impression that the victim (who has a very fair complexion) was a Caucasian.
[74]
62        The first accused asked the victim why he had bumped into him. The first accused testified that he thought he heard the victim say, “What do you want?”. He hence asked the victim, “Are you drunk?”. The victim, however, pushed him and mumbled again, “What do you want?”. The first accused then pushed the victim, and either pushed or punched him on the chest. At that time, the first accused was drunk.
[75]
 
As he was under the influence of alcohol after his many drinks, the first accused stated that he could not really recall whether it was a push or a punch, but he admitted that he did use force on the victim.
[76]
63        It was the first accused’s evidence that, when he confronted the victim, he had acted purely on his own.
[77]
 
None of his friends were involved.
[78]
 
His confrontation of the victim was a spontaneous act on his part done on the spur of the moment.
[79]
 
The first accused also had no intention to get his friends involved. He did not call to his friends to join or help him to confront the victim.
[80]
 
There was also no prior plan for the first accused and his group to commit any offence such as assault, robbery or theft.
[81]
64        However, after the first accused had pushed the victim, Abdul Hadi appeared on the scene and he punched and kicked the victim.
[82]
 
Abdul Hadi had done this entirely on his own.
[83]
 
The first accused did not ask Abdul Hadi to come and help him.
[84]
65        The tape-recording showed that there was a third man at the scene. The first accused did not know who this third man was. The first accused stated that, at that time, as far as he was aware, the only person who came to his assistance was Abdul Hadi. As he was drunk and his attention was focused on the victim, he did not realize that there was another person there. The first accused believed that the victim, upon seeing Abdul Hadi and the third man coming towards him, must have thought that they were with the first accused.
66        The victim ran in the direction towards Funan Centre. The first accused chased the victim, and Abdul Hadi also ran behind the first accused. The first accused was not sure if the third man had also chased the victim. Owing to his intoxicated state, the first accused was not sure if he had punched the victim, causing the latter to fall to the ground.
[85]
 
He could only remember that, in the course of the chase, he himself had also fallen onto the road. The first accused could not recall how he had fallen. He might have tripped whilst running as he was then drunk.
[86]
 
The first accused estimated that he had fallen around the spot marked as “R1” in photo 
P46S
, about five to six steps, or 4 m, away from the spot where the victim had fallen. The first accused also could not remember if he had got up on his own or if anyone had helped him up.
67        When the first accused got up, he realised that his watch was not on his hand. His watch had come loose when he fell down. This watch was a gift from his father. It had fallen about two or three steps away from the first accused
[87]
, at a spot closer to the victim. The first accused went forward, picked up the watch and put it in his pocket. He looked to his left and saw Abdul Hadi sitting on top of the victim who was lying on the ground, around the spot marked as “R2” in photo 
P46S
. At that time, the first accused also saw the second accused on the road but he did not pay attention to what the second accused was doing
[88]
68        The first accused testified that he then saw a group of male Malays running towards where the victim was.
[89]
 
Aziz was also running towards the victim.
[90]
 
Everything happened very fast.
[91]
 
Seeing this, the first accused panicked.
[92]
 
He had not asked for help from the others or asked them to do anything to the victim.
[93]
 
In a state of panic, the first accused ran back towards the 7-Eleven Store to call for Mas.
[94]
 
He wanted her to get away from the place together with him.
69        As the first accused was running back to the 7-Eleven Store, the group of male Malays ran past him towards the victim.
[95]
 
The first accused also saw Aziz running towards the victim, but he could not recall if Aziz had run together with the group of male Malays. Whilst running back, the first accused also saw a security guard (presumably Borhanudin) standing around a spot marked as “T” in photo 
P46S
.
70        The first accused testified that he did not ever punch or kick the victim. He did not go near the victim after the latter had fallen to the ground.
[96]
 
He also did not see the group of male Malays assault the victim, but he assumed that they had assaulted the victim.
[97]
 
As for the second accused, the first accused testified that he did not see him go into the fray to extricate Abdul Hadi and Aziz.
[98]
71        Subsequently, the first accused left the place in a taxi, together with Mas and two other persons, and proceeded to Aziz’s house.
72        The next day, at about 1 pm, the first accused, accompanied by Mas, went to the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, and lodged a police report on the loss of his wallet. After lodging the report, the first accused telephoned the second accused and was told that the latter and Aziz were at the coffeeshop near the second accused’s house. The first accused hence proceeded to the coffeeshop with Mas. The first accused wanted to ask the second accused where he had gone with his wife and sister-in-law the night before. As the first accused explained, it was meant to be more of a confrontation, than a gesture out of concern for the second accused.
73        At the coffeeshop, the first accused noticed that the second accused was limping. The second accused said that he was limping as a result of what had happened the day before.
[99]
 
The first accused understood him to be referring to the incident that occurred at Peninsula Plaza
. But the first accused did not know whether the second accused was limping because someone had kicked his leg or because he had kicked someone.
74        The first accused did not ask the second accused why he was limping. He only wanted to find out where the second accused had gone the previous night. The first accused explained that, on that day, he was disappointed with the way the second accused had behaved.
[100]
 
It was the second accused who had wanted to go to Peninsula Plaza
 and who had persuaded the first accused to accompany him there. However, when the incident arose, he abandoned the first accused and the rest and went off with his wife and sister-in-law. The second accused did not ever bother to check on the first accused’s condition. As a result, the first accused felt very disappointed with the second accused and in return did not bother to inquire further on the second accused’s leg injury. The first accused’s only concern was to confront the second accused and find out where he had gone the night before.
75        The first accused found that he was unable to have much conversation with the second accused and he soon left with Mas. On 31 May 2004, the first accused was arrested by the police.
Impeachment of the first accused’s credit
76        The prosecution sought to impeach the first accused’s credit on the grounds that there were material inconsistencies between his testimony in court and two of his four statements recorded under Section 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). These were his second long statement recorded on 7 Jun 2004 at 1.30 pm by SIO Gurcharn Singh and his fourth long statement recorded on 13 Jun 2004 at 4.52 pm by S/Sgt Edmund Tan. The prosecution further applied for Answers 9 and 10 of the fourth long statement to be admitted as evidence of the truth of the contents, pursuant to Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). The first accused’s first and third long statements were not adduced in evidence before the Court.
Evidence of the second accused (Rizal bin Hassan)
77        The second accused (
DW 2
), who is also known as “Daniel”, confirmed that, on the evening of 26 May 2004, he had invited the first accused and Abdul Hadi to join him for a drinking session at the coffeeshop near his house. It was on that day that the second accused first introduced Aziz, who was the second accused’s friend, to the first accused and Abdul Hadi.
78        From about 8 pm plus to 11 pm, he, the first accused, Abdul Hadi, Aziz and Salamah had a drinking session at the coffeeshop, during which they consumed around ten to eleven bottles of beer and four bottles of Stout.
[101]
 
Only the second accused, Salamah , Siti Aishah and Aziz drank the Stout. At one point, Siti Aishah had joined them and consumed some Stout, before she left for work as a waitress at the Isola Bella KTV.
79        When the first accused and Abdul Hadi said that they wanted to go to the Chocolate Bar, the second accused expressed his wish to join them. He wanted to give his wife, Salamah, a treat as she had previously complained to him that he had not taken her out at night for enjoyment since his release from prison on 30 Apr 2004. It was then agreed that all of them would have a night out at the Chocolate Bar.
80        At the Chocolate Bar, the second accused and his party consumed about five to six jugs of Bourbon Coke. Subsequently, Siti Aishah also joined them after reporting off from work and a further bottle of Martell brandy was ordered. At the pub, the first accused also befriended Mas and brought her to join their party.
81        The second accused gave evidence that, at the Chocolate Bar, he met two male Malays, namely, “Saigon
” and “Gak”.
[102]
 
At the pub, he also noticed another two male Malays, “Eddie” and “An An”, but he did not acknowledge them. None of the four men joined the second accused at his table. According to the second accused, these four men were his former secret society friends whom he had got to know when he had been active in secret society activities. The second accused claimed that, by 26 May 2004, he was no longer involved with the secret society. The second accused further added that
 Saigon and Gak on one hand, and Eddie and An An on the other hand were from two different branches of the same secret society. These four men were not the second accused’s close friends.
82        Subsequently, as the second accused’s party headed towards Peninsula Plaza, on North Bridge Road, the second accused met by chance Eddie, An An and a few other men. The second accused introduced these friends of his to the first accused, Abdul Hadi and Aziz.
83        One of the men (either Eddie or An An) approached the second accused for help. He said that he had a misunderstanding with another group of male Malays and asked the second accused to help him. The second accused replied that he would think about it and consider whether to help.  The second accused, however, did not share this development or information with the first accused, Abdul Hadi or Aziz.
[103]
 
Instead, he suggested to his own party that they should move to Peninsula Plaza
. The second accused claimed that his thinking then was that he did not want An An’s rival group to think that he and his friends were together with An An and Eddie.
84        The second accused also claimed that he did not know that An An’s group would also proceed to Peninsula Plaza
. He had only noticed their presence when he came out of the 7-Eleven Store at Peninsula Plaza after buying some drinks and sweets. The second accused further claimed that, outside the 7-Eleven Store, there had been a shouting match between An An’s and Eddy’s group, and Saigon and Gak’s group. Abdul Hadi and Aziz had also gone to join An An’s group. There were seven men on An An’s side and about six men on Saigon’s side. During this time, the first accused was still inside the 7-Eleven Store.
[104]
85        The second accused confirmed that he subsequently witnessed the initial confrontation between the first accused and the victim. He saw the first accused hold the victim by the shirt along the corridor in front of the SK Store in Peninsula Plaza
. Later, Abdul Hadi also approached the victim. But the second accused was too far away to see clearly whether the first accused or Abdul Hadi had punched the victim. The second accused also saw a third man appear on the scene. The second accused believed that this third man had earlier mingled with An An’s group outside the 7-Eleven Store.
[105]
86        The second accused testified that he ignored what he saw and turned back towards Funan Centre.
[106]
 
Subsequently, upon hearing someone shout in Malay, “Don’t let him run”, he turned around again and saw that both the victim and the first accused had already fallen onto the ground.
[107]
 
According to the second accused, he ran forward and assisted the first accused to get up. The second accused claimed that he was wondering what had happened, when an unknown male Malay kicked him on his right chest. The second accused fell onto the ground. A few other male Malays also came and gave the second accused a few punches and kicks. There were three to four male Malays assaulting him. The second accused was kicked mostly on his right, namely, on his chest, waist and hip.
[108]
 
The second accused defended himself by throwing punches at his attackers. He eventually managed to stand up and continued to throw punches at them until they fled.
87        When the group had fled, the second accused saw Abdul Hadi walking towards him from his left.
[109]
 
On the second accused’s left, there were another three to four male Malays
[110]
, including Aziz and the third man whom he had earlier seen along the corridor
[111]
. The second accused could not recognize the rest of them. He assumed that all of them had assaulted the victim.
[112]
 
The second accused claimed that he punched Aziz when the latter came towards him, as he believed Aziz had assaulted the victim.
88        The second accused subsequently fled the scene and went home with Salamah and Siti Aishah. At home, the second accused felt pain on his right chest, right waist and hip. The injuries, especially those on his waist and hip, made him limp.
[113]
 
The second accused did not suffer any injury on his leg.
[114]
89        The second accused denied having told Siti Aishah that night about the injury to his leg. He claimed that he did not have any conversation with Siti Aishah after the incident.
[115]
90        The second accused admitted that, prior to meeting up with the first accused at the coffeeshop the next day, he had a misunderstanding with him over the telephone. The first accused had questioned him as to why he had not gone to Aziz’s house after the incident. The second accused then arranged for the first accused to meet him at the coffeeshop near his house. The second accused denied that, at the coffeeshop, he had told the first accused that he had injured his leg. He only said that he had been assaulted.
[116]
 
In particular, he did not say that he had sprained his ankle.
[117]
91        The second accused testified that he did not consult a doctor for his injuries as he could bear the pain. However, after his arrest on 1 Jun 2004, whilst in police custody, between 3 Jun 2004 and 16 Jun 2004, the second accused was admitted to two hospitals on four separate occasions, for complaints of chest pains and pains at the stomach near the waist. In addition, on one occasion, after consuming food in the police lock-up, the second accused had vomited blood. The doctors found injuries on his right chest and some problems with his stomach. In particular, the doctor was concerned as to whether the second accused’s chest had recently been hit by any blunt object. The second accused, however, did not complain of any leg injury and the doctors also did not find any injury on his leg.
Impeachment of the second accused’s credit
92        During cross-examination, the prosecution sought to impeach the second accused’s credit on the grounds that there were material discrepancies between his testimony and his three statements recorded under Section 121 of the Criminal Procedure on 2, 7 and 14 Jun 2004 respectively.
93        The prosecution also applied for paragraph 13 of the second accused’s first long statement (
P86
) and one part of A14 of his second long statement (
P87
) to be admitted as evidence of the truth of the contents of the statement pursuant to Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act.
Decision of the court
94        The prosecution’s case against the first accused for the rioting charge was based mainly on the following evidence :-
(a)        Salamah’s identification of the first accused as being a member of the group that had assaulted the victim on Coleman Street
;
(b)        Paragraph 13 of the second accused’s first long statement (
P86
) and one part of A14 of his second long statement (
P87
) (wherein the second accused claimed to have seen the first accused kick and punch the victim) to be admitted as evidence of the truth of the contents of those parts of the statements, pursuant to Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act;
(c)        The first accused’s cautioned statement (
P84
) (which would show that the first accused was present when the group of male Malays started assaulting the victim); and
(d)        The first accused’s implied admission to Mas that he had beaten up the victim.
95        The prosecution also sought to impeach the first accused’s credit on the grounds that there were material inconsistencies between his testimony in court and what he had stated in his cautioned statement (
P64
) and second and fourth long statements (
P84
 and 
P85
).
Salamah’s identification evidence
96        Salamah was the only witness for the prosecution who claimed to  have seen the first accused assault the victim. As the prosecution’s case would depend substantially on the correctness of her identification evidence, the three-step test for the assessment of identification evidence enunciated by the Court of Appeal in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas
 v 
PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
 would be applicable.
Salamah’s identification of the second accused
97        Salamah identified one of the men in the group to be the second accused based on his type of clothing and the colour of both his clothing and hair.
[118]
 
The man whom she saw in the group wore a short-sleeved T-shirt with a collar and he had golden hair. I accepted Salamah’s evidence that, on that night, apart from the men who had come with her to Peninsula Plaza
, there was no other group of men in that area.
[119]
 
Among the men who had come with Salamah to
 Peninsula Plaza, the second accused was the only one who was wearing a short-sleeved polo T-shirt with a collar. He was also the only one with golden hair. Furthermore, being his wife and having been with him for a few years, Salamah was familiar with the second accused’s physique and the way he moved. Salamah could hence be positive that the man she saw was indeed the second accused.
98        Salamah’s identification of the second accused was also corroborated by Abdul Hadi’s evidence that the second accused had run towards him and the victim, and later run away with a group of male Malays after the assault. Abdul Hadi had also noticed, in particular, the second accused’s golden hair.
[120]
 
Salamah’s identification of the second accused was further corroborated by the second accused’s admission to Siti Aishah that he had kicked the victim’s face. For these reasons, in my decision to convict the second accused on the charge for rioting, I relied, 
inter alia
, on Salamah’s identification evidence against the second accused. I was satisfied of the accuracy of her identification evidence against the second accused, notwithstanding the slight discrepancy in her testimony on whether she had been standing or sitting when she saw the group of men.
Salamah’s identification of the first accused
99        In contrast, Salamah’s identification of the first accused was premised on much weaker grounds. Salamah gave evidence that her identification of the first accused was based on the colour of his shirt.
[121]
 
It was not disputed that, on that night, the first accused was wearing a black T-shirt. However, most of the men on that night were wearing black.
[122]
 
Indeed, it appears that most, if not all, of the women were also wearing black.
[123]
100      Salamah’s position initially was that her sole basis for identifying the first accused was the colour of his shirt.
[124]
 
It was only later, when reminded that most of the men on that night were also wearing black, that Salamah added another ground for her identification of the first accused, namely, the fact that the shirt which he had borrowed to wear was very tight-fitting.
[125]
101      It is to be noted, however, that the assault had been witnessed by Salamah through a small gap between a pillar and a store (as shown in photo 
P52
), from a distance about 25 m to 35 m away. The assault had taken place at a fairly dim location
[126]
 
and all the men had their backs turned towards her. Both the victim and Borhanudin testified that the assault was over very quickly. It lasted only a few seconds and Salamah had looked away even before the assault ended. Salamah herself testified that, at that time, she did not want to see the fight. She had quickly turned her head away from the scene because she did not want to see anything.
102      Under such circumstances, and given the lighting conditions and the distance from which she saw the assault, it is difficult to comprehend how Salamah would be able to properly distinguish the degree of tightness the first accused’s black shirt clung to his body from that of the other men who were also wearing black. Further, unlike the distinguishing features used by Salamah to identify the second accused (namely, the type of shirt and the colour of his hair), there was no evidence adduced before the Court to show that the first accused was the only man who was wearing a tight-fitting shirt at Peninsula Plaza on that night.
103      I observed that the first accused was a relatively short man, in comparison with Abdul Hadi, Aziz or the second accused. However, when asked why she had identified the first accused as being amongst the group who assaulted the victim, Salamah did not ever cite the person’s height as a reason. Indeed, there was nothing in the evidence adduced before the Court to show that Salamah had even taken note of the height of the man whom she saw. I further took into account the fact that, prior to witnessing the assault, Salamah had been drinking for at least three to four hours at the Chocolate Bar. Evidence was also led from a prosecution witness to show that Salamah and her friends had consumed about five jugs of Bourbon Coke at the pub.
[127]
104      I further observed that Salamah had a tendency of saying that she saw certain people or things even when she had not actually seen them but merely assumed that such was the state of affairs. For example, Salamah initially testified that she could not tell how many men had surrounded and assaulted the victim.
[128]
 
However, when reminded through the questions put to her that the men who were with her on that night numbered six (namely, the first and second accused persons, Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie and An An), she made a complete turnabout and claimed to be positive that there had been six men surrounding the victim.
[129]
 
Similarly, Salamah initially gave evidence that, out of the group that surrounded the victim, she could only recognize the first and second accused persons, and that she had not seen the faces of any of the men. However, subsequently, when reminded, through the questions put to her, of the names of the men who were with her on that night, she again changed her evidence and now claimed that, apart from the first and second accused persons, she had also specifically seen Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie and An An.
[130]
105      Having had the benefit of observing her demeanour as she gave her evidence and after a careful examination of her evidence, it was clear to me that, Salamah had already made up her mind, through her own deductions and surmises, that all the men in her group had participated in the assault on the victim,
[131]
 
and that some (but not all) of her positive assertions in court were actually surmises, rather than actual observations, made by her. As Salamah admitted in court, she assumed that all the men in her group had participated in the assault because there was no other group present at Peninsula Plaza
 that night.
[132]
 
Nevertheless, presence in the vicinity cannot be equated with active participation in the assault and, given Salamah’s tendency to represent some of her assumptions or surmises as actual observations, her evidence should be treated with caution.
106      Salamah’s identification evidence against the first accused was also contradicted by another prosecution witness. It was Abdul Hadi’s evidence that the first accused was not among the men who surrounded the victim and kicked him. Abdul Hadi testified that the first accused had already run away before the group of men came to the victim.
[133]
 
Abdul Hadi’s evidence was not challenged by the prosecution.
107      In my opinion, Salamah’s identification evidence against the first accused was of very poor quality. Salamah also failed to give adequate reasons to satisfactorily account for how she could accurately single out one man wearing black, out of a group of men, most of whom were also wearing black, to be the first accused. Her evidence on her alleged observation of the first accused made from a distance of 25 m to 35 m away was further contradicted by the evidence of another prosecution witness who was then at the spot where the assault took place. I did not find Salamah’s identification evidence against the first accused to be reliable.
Impeachment exercise against the second accused
Impeachment with reference to the second accused’s first long statement (P86)
108      The second accused’s first long statement (
P86
) was recorded on 2 Jun 2004 at about 8.52 pm by the Investigation Officer, S/Sgt Edmund Tan, at the police station. The contents of this statement were substantially similar to what the second accused had earlier stated in his cautioned statement (
P65
).
109      In paragraph 11 of his first long statement, the second accused stated that the first accused had been involved in the commotion at Peninsula Plaza, together with Abdul Hadi, Aziz and three to four unknown male Malays. This was inconsistent with the second accused’s evidence in court, where he testified that, during the commotion, the first accused was still inside the 7-Eleven Store.
110      In paragraph 12, the second accused stated that, at one point during this first commotion (which involved the shouting match between the two rival groups), the first accused, Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie, An An and the other unknown male Malays started to run. This was inconsistent with the second accused’s evidence in court which was that he had not seen any chase. The second accused testified that he had only assumed that the first accused, Abdul Hadi and the unknown male Malay (who was present during the second commotion) must have chased the victim. He also did not see Aziz chase the victim.
111      In paragraph 13, it was stated that the first accused had kicked and punched the victim, and that Aziz had stamped his legs on the victim. In court, however, the second accused testified that he did not see the first accused kick or punch the victim on the road.
[134]
 
He also did not see Aziz kick the victim, but he assumed that Aziz might have kicked the victim from the waist level upwards, especially the head, since Abdul Hadi was then sitting on the victim, with his legs covering the victim’s legs, and any kicks inflicted on the lower half of the victim’s body might land on Abdul Hadi’s legs instead.
[135]
112      In paragraph 14, the second accused stated that he had pulled the first accused away from the victim by his collar. In court, the second accused testified that he could remember having held onto the first accused’s left arm to assist him to get up.
[136]
 
He could not recall if he had also pulled him by the collar.
[137]
113      When invited to explain the discrepancies between his testimony and these paragraphs in his first long statement, the second accused gave evidence that, for the recording of his first long statement, there had been about four to five police officers inside the room, interrogating him on this case.
[138]
 
These officers included three Indians, S/Sgt Edmund Tan and one Sgt Mohd Amin.
[139]
 
Prior to the recording of this statement, these same police officers had also interrogated him on roughly two other occasions.
[140]
 
The second accused further testified that, while S/Sgt Edmund Tan was recording the first long statement, all the other officers, including S/Sgt Mohd Amin, remained in the room.
[141]
114      The second accused testified that he was warned by these officers that they already knew what had actually taken place. They told him that they already had a “tailor-made” statement.
[142]
 
The officers gave the second accused a few scenarios which they said they had learnt from his friends. They also added that most of his friends had already admitted to hitting the victim. The officers insisted that the scenario they gave him was what had taken place.
[143]
 
According to the second accused, all this was said to him during the time when the statement was being recorded.
[144]
115      With regards to the account given in paragraph 11, the second accused testified that he had told S/Sgt Edmund Tan and S/Sgt Amin that only Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie, An An and three to four unknown male Malay were outside the 7-Eleven Store when the first commotion occurred.
[145]
 
Similarly, for paragraph 12, the second accused had also told the officers that the people who chased the victim consisted of only the first accused, Abdul Hadi and one male Malay. However, for both paragraphs, the officers insisted on using phrases that would include everyone else. The references which the second accused had made to certain persons only were recorded in the statement as references that would include everyone, namely, the first accused, Abdul Hadi, Aziz, Eddie, An An and a few other unknown male Malays.
[146]
 
The officers told the second accused that it was all right to record his references in such an expansive way.
116      With respect to paragraph 13, the second accused maintained that he had only told the officers that he had assisted the first accused to get up and that he had then seen Aziz on his left. The police officers, however, presented a scenario to him where he (the second accused) had additionally seen the first accused kick and punch the victim, and seen Aziz kick the victim.
[147]
 
The sentences that stated that the first accused had kicked and punched the victim, and that Aziz had stamped his legs on the victim did not come from the second accused. They were the officers’ account after interrogating the second accused’s friends.
[148]
117      During the recording of the statement, the second accused informed the officers that he had not seen any of this, but the officers told him that it was all right to write it as such since his charge only concerned gang robbery.
[149]
 
The officers told the second accused that they would only concentrate on the gang robbery.
[150]
 
The second accused further testified that he could remember that he had also given other details of the incident to the officers, but the officers failed to record them in the statement.
118      The second accused further testified that he had been concerned that his friends would have problems if he wrongly implicated them. During the recording of the statement, he asked an officer whether he would cause any problems to his friends by stating that he had seen the first accused kick and punch the victim, and Aziz stamp his legs on the victim, when he had not actually seen this. In reply, the officer simply reiterated that the police was more interested in the gang robbery and not on who had assaulted the victim.
[151]
 
It was for this reason that the second accused signed the statement, notwithstanding the fact that it was not entirely true. The statement that was recorded was hence a mixture of the truth and what the officers insisted was what had happened.
[152]
119      As for the amendments in paragraphs 14 and 16, these amendments had been made by the police officer, and not by the second accused, in order to correct some spelling mistakes. The officer had made the amendments and then asked the second accused to sign beside the amendments.
[153]
Impeachment with reference to the second accused’s second long statement (P87)
120      The second accused’s second long statement (
P87
) was recorded from him at his hospital bed on 7 Jun 2004. He had been re-admitted to Changi General Hospital on 5 Jun 2004 for chest pains, pains at his stomach near the waist and vomiting of blood, and was discharged only on 10 Jun 2004 (before he was admitted to another hospital on 11 Jun 2004). This second long statement was recorded by S/Sgt Mohd Amin.
121      In Answer 14 in the second long statement, there was a repetition of what had been recorded in the second accused’s first long statement, namely, that the second accused had seen Aziz and a few others chase the victim with the first accused and Abdul Hadi, that he had seen the first accused punch and kick the victim on the road, and that he had seen Aziz stamp on the victim’s face. In Answer 14, it was further stated that the second accused had seen Eddie, An An and two others in the midst of the commotion. This contradicted the second accused’s testimony that he had not seen Eddy and An An during the assault.
122      When invited to explain the discrepancies between his evidence in court and what was stated in Answer 14, the second accused testified that, for the recording of this second statement, he had been subjected to the same treatment as that for the first long statement. During the recording of the second long statement, S/Sgt Mohd Amin suggested to him a few scenarios of what had taken place on that night.
[154]
 
The second accused had voiced his disagreement with the scenarios but S/Sgt Mohd Amin just ignored him and recorded the statement in this manner.
123      In particular, the second accused testified that, for Answer 14, he did tell S/Sgt Mohd Amin that he had not seen the first accused punch or kick the victim, and that he had also not seen Aziz assault the victim.
[155]
 
S/Sgt Mohd Amin, however, said that, since everyone was then in the vicinity of the victim, these two friends of his (namely, the first accused and Aziz) must have assaulted the victim. The second accused had disagreed as he had not seen it, but again S/Sgt Mohd Amin ignored him. In the end, the scenarios suggested by S/Sgt Mohd Amin came to be recorded in the statement.
124      The second accused further testified that, during the recording of his statements, the police officers had tried to make him feel resentful towards his friends, so that he would agree to make incriminating statements against them.
[156]
 
The second accused pointed out that an illustration of this could be seen in Answer 10 of his second long statement. In order to get the second accused to agree with the allegations that the police wanted him to make against the first accused, the police told him that the first accused had made certain allegations against him. In particular, they informed him that the first accused was the one who told the police that the second accused had planned the robbery and suggested to the group to go to Peninsula Plaza
 to pick a fight. 
[157]
125      The second accused also gave evidence that, during his first two interrogation sessions, the police officers said that his friends had already told them that the second accused had assaulted the victim.
[158]
 
When the second accused denied this, the question on whether he had assaulted the victim was repeated again and again until the second accused made a statement, in Answer 13, to the effect that he had thrown punches but did not know where they had landed.
Impeachment with reference to the second accused’s third long statement (P88)
126      The second accused’s third long statement was recorded on 14 Jun 2004 at about 6.25 pm by S/Sgt Edmund Tan at Ward 57 of the Singapore General Hospital, during the former’s third admission to hospital. In answer to Question 17, as to whether he had been injured when he met up with the first accused and Mas at the coffeeshop the day after the incident, the second accused had replied in the negative. In court, however, the second accused’s testimony was that, since the night of the incident, he had felt pain from the injuries on his right chest, right waist and hip, which also caused him to limp the next day.
127      When invited to explain the discrepancy, the second accused gave evidence that, notwithstanding the general nature of the question as recorded in Question 17, the question that was actually posed to him was a specific one. The question which S/Sgt Edmund Tan had posed to the second accused was whether his leg, especially his ankle, had been injured when he met the first accused and Mas at the coffeeshop. It was to this question that the second accused answered in the negative and gave the answer as recorded in Answer 17. The second accused was not asked if other parts of his body had been injured after the incident. S/Sgt Edmund Tan was especially interested in whether the second accused had injuries on his leg, especially the ankle, and had kept asking him about this.
Additional Allegations made by the Second Accused for all his statements
128      The second accused did not challenge the voluntariness of his three long statements (
P86
, 
P87
 and 
P88
) and cautioned statement (
P65
). His position, however, was that each of the four statements was a mixture of the truth and the version given by the police officers based on what they had found out after interrogating the second accused’s friends.
[159]
  For parts of the statements, the second accused had simply followed and adopted the police officers’ suggestions of what could have taken place on that night, even though he did not actually notice such events himself.
[160]
 
For all the three long statements, during the recording, the second accused had told the police officers that he did not agree with certain parts of the recorded statements, but all of them ignored him.
[161]
 
When the second accused was later invited to make amendments to his statements, he again pointed out to them certain facts that he disagreed with, but the police officers just told them that it was all right.
[162]
129      For all his statements, the recording officer had paraphased what the second accused actually said.
[163]
 
The second accused also gave evidence that he had mentioned to the police Saigon
’s and Gak’s names, and given other details of the incident but all these were not recorded down by the police.
[164]
 
Prior to the commencement of the recording for each of the long statements, the second accused was not given a warning as to what the recording officer was conducting an investigation into.
[165]
 
The second accused was only aware of a charge for gang robbery when his cautioned statement was recorded. Subsequently, for the recording of his long statements, whenever he argued with the officers, such as S/Sgt Edmund Tan and S/Sgt Mohd Amin, over what had actually taken place,
[166]
 
the police would indicate that the inaccuracies were acceptable as the police would focus only on the charge for gang robbery, and they were not interested in who had assaulted the victim.
[167]
Court’s Ruling that the Second Accused’s Credit was not impeached
130      With regards to the discrepancy in paragraph 14 of the second accused’s first long statement (
P86
), I was of the view that it was a minor discrepancy which did not impugn on the second accused’s veracity and credibility. The discrepancy on the exact manner in which the second accused had assisted the first accused to get up (whether by pulling at his collar or by holding on to his left arm) was not a material inconsistency that had a direct bearing on the facts in issue.
131      With regards to the second accused’s third long statement (
P88
), the purpose of a substantial part of this statement appeared to be to record the second accused’s comments on statements made by other witnesses to the police. In Questions 13 to 19, the second accused was invited to respond to statements allegedly made by the first accused, Mas and Abdul Hadi to the police which were contrary to the second accused’s earlier statements. The focus of Questions 18 and 19, which followed immediately after Question 17, was on whether the second accused was limping at the coffeeshop the day after the incident. This was consistent with the second accused’s testimony that, regardless of how the question was recorded in Question 17, the question posed to him was a more specific one; it was limited to the issue of whether he had any leg injuries on that day. In fact, the police had been particularly interested in whether the second accused had any leg injuries, at least from 7 Jun 2004 onwards. Questions 5 and 26 of the second accused’s second statement (
P87
) showed that, during the recording of this earlier statement, the police were already repeatedly asking the second accused if he had any leg injuries. Further, the second accused could not be said to have tried, in his third long statement, to conceal the injuries on other parts of his body from the police, given that he had already informed the police in his earlier second statement of his chest and stomach injuries. In my opinion, the discrepancy in Answer 17 did not affect the second accused’s credit.
132      More importantly, for all his statements, the second accused had made specific allegations against specific police officers, in order to explain the discrepancies between his statements and his evidence. The prosecution did not call any of the police officers to give evidence to rebut these allegations. The second accused’s allegations were, therefore, unrebutted and unchallenged. At the conclusion of the trial, I accepted the second accused’s explanations for the discrepancies, and ruled that his credit had not been impeached.
Application under Section 147(3) of Evidence Act for the second accused’s long statements
133      Even if the second accused’s credit had been impeached and those portions of his statements sought to be admitted by the prosecution became admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents, pursuant to Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act, I would have placed little weight on those portions of the statements.
134      Caution must always be exercised when admitting a previous inconsistent statement for the truth of its contents (
Lee Yuen Hong
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
). Section 147(6) of the Evidence Act provides that, in assessing the weight to be attached to a previous inconsistent statement, the Court shall have regard to
“… all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.”
In determining what weight should be accorded to an inconsistent statement admissible by virtue of Section 147(3), the guidelines laid down by the Honourable the Chief Justice Yong Pung How in 
Public Prosecutor
 v 
Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
 and the Court of Appeal in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin
   v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 must be borne in mind.
135      A careful perusal of the second accused’s statements would show that, throughout his statements, the second accused was making a conscious effort to minimize his role in the whole incident. For instance, in his first long statement, the second accused included Eddie and An An in the assault by claiming that he had seen them during the attack on the victim. He then distanced himself from them by falsely portraying them as the first accused’s friends whom he had met for the very first time on that night, when the truth was that they were his own friends whom he introduced to the others. The second accused even went to the extent of describing how on that night he had exchanged telephone numbers with An An, to reinforce the false impression that they had been strangers to each other until that night. In the same statement, the second accused also lied that he had only taken soft drinks while the others had beer, in order to portray himself as the sole sober soul amongst a group of drunken brawlers.
136      These statements, parts of which the prosecution sought to admit in evidence, were not statements wherein the second accused had admitted his own guilt and then, in cooperation with the police, provided information on the roles played by his co-offenders. In all the statements, the second accused completely exonerated himself. He denied that he had participated in the assault and confined all the incriminating assertions to the others. In addition, the second accused would rely on the active roles of violence allegedly played by the others to portray himself as a heroic figure who had gone into the fray only to stop the others from further assaulting the victim. The second accused’s allegations against the others would also assist him to account for Salamah’s positive identification of him being amongst the group of men who kicked the victim.
137      I further noted that the second accused would embellish the acts of the others as further statements were recorded from him. In his cautioned statement (
P65
), the second accused stated that Aziz had kicked the victim. Subsequently, in his first long statement (
P86
), the second accused alleged that Aziz had stamped on the victim.  By the time the second long statement (
P87
) came to be recorded, Aziz’s original act of kicking had been inflated by the second accused into actual stamping on the victim’s face.
138      The second accused would also have a motive to misrepresent the facts in his statements. There was a significant risk that the second accused might have borne a grudge against the others for making incriminating statements about him to the police and he had, therefore, misrepresented the facts to implicate them in return. It was the second accused’s evidence that, during his first two interrogation sessions, he was informed that his friends had told the police that he had assaulted the victim. In particular, the second accused was informed by the police that it was the first accused who had said that the second accused was the one who had planned the robbery and suggested that the group go to Peninsula Plaza to pick a fight.
139      Under such circumstances, even if the second accused’s credit had been impeached, it would not be safe to place weight on those portions which incriminated the first accused, and rely on them as evidence to support a conviction for the first accused.
Impeachment exercise against the first accused
Impeachment with reference to the first accused’s second long statement (
P84
)
140      Although the learned DPP initially underlined four parts of the first accused’s second long statement, the cross-examination was confined to only the underlined portion in Answer 7.
141      In Answer 7, the first accused stated that Abdul Hadi and Eddie were the first to reach the victim when the latter was still lying on the road after falling down. Abdul Hadi and Eddie began to kick the victim, and they were soon joined by Aziz, An An and one male Malay who also kicked the victim. The second accused was standing behind some of the men and the first accused did not know if he had kicked the victim.
142      This was different from the first accused’s testimony in court. His evidence was that, after getting up and retrieving his watch, he had only seen Abdul Hadi sitting on top of the victim. When he was running back towards the direction of the 7-Eleven Store, he did not notice if Eddie and An An were part of the group of male Malays who were running towards the victim.
[168]
 
After fleeing from the scene, he did not see Eddie, An An or the group assault the victim.
[169]
143      When asked to explain the discrepancy between his testimony and his statement, the first accused testified that he had actually only seen Aziz and some others approach the victim.
[170]
 
However, from the day that he was arrested on 31 May 2004, whilst in police custody, the first accused was repeatedly questioned by the police officers on whether Aziz, Abdul Hadi and Eddie were among those who had kicked the victim.
[171]
 
Whenever he was brought out of the police lock-up, the first accused would be questioned on this.
[172]
 
Many police officers would also come to the first accused from time to time and interrogate him on this.
[173]
144      The first accused gave evidence that, on the first day of his arrest, he had informed the police that he had already run away from the scene after picking himself up from the ground.
[174]
 
He also told the police that he had not seen anybody kick the victim.
[175]
 
But the police officers did not believe him and instead kept asking him who had assaulted the victim.
145      Further, during the police investigations, the first accused was repeatedly told by the police that Abdul Hadi had already informed them that Aziz, Eddie and the rest had kicked the victim.
[176]
 
The police further informed him that Abdul Hadi had admitted to being involved in the assault.
[177]
 
The first accused hence presumed that Abdul Hadi, Aziz and Eddie could have been in the group which assaulted the victim.
[178]
146      The first accused gave evidence that, by the time the second long statement was recorded from him on 7 Jun 2004, he was weary from being repeatedly interrogated on this issue. He did not want to be called a liar by disagreeing with the police officers again.
[179]
 
As a result, when the same question was posed to him again, albeit only once
[180]
 
during the recording of this statement, the second accused decided to go along with the police officers and he accepted that the persons whose names were given to him were among those who had assaulted the victim,
[181]
 
so as to put an end to the repeated questioning. The second accused then named Aziz, Abdul Hadi, Eddie, An An and one male Malay as being those who had kicked the victim, even though he had not actually seen it. He had named the male Malay as he had seen him at Aziz’s flat after the incident later that night.
[182]
147      As to why he had stated in his second long statement that the second accused had been standing behind some of the men in the group, the first accused testified that what he had actually seen was the second accused standing behind him before he ran away from the scene. I noted that this had always been the first accused’s position in court, before the prosecution sought to use his long statements to impeach his credit.
[183]
 
The first accused testified that, as he had seen the second accused stand behind him before he ran away, and he also saw the group of men run towards that area, they would all eventually be around that area and he hence simply put it in his statement that the second accused was behind the men in that area.
[184]
Impeachment with reference to the first accused’s fourth long statement (
P85
)
148      In Answer 9 of his fourth long statement (
P85
), the first accused stated that, prior to meeting up with the second accused at the coffeeshop the day after the incident, the second accused had told him that he was injured. In court, the first accused’s evidence was that he had not known that the second accused’s leg was injured before he met him at the coffeeshop.
[185]
149      When shown his fourth long statement, the first accused accepted that what he had said in the statement was correct. The first accused explained that his earlier testimony had been different as the event had taken place some time ago and, by the time he gave evidence in court (on 21 Dec 2004), he was no longer able to remember the exact details. The first accused added that the second accused might have told him of his leg injury over the telephone.
150      In Answer 10 of the fourth long statement, the following words were recorded :-
“Daniel told me that he injured his leg during the kicking the victim in Peninsula.”
The first accused’s evidence in court was that, at the coffeeshop, he did not know whether the second accused was limping because someone had kicked his leg or because he had kicked someone.
[186]
151      The prosecution interpreted Answer 10 to mean that, at the coffeeshop, the second accused had told the first accused that the former had injured his leg when he kicked the victim. On this interpretation, the prosecution submitted that there was a material discrepancy between Answer 10 and the first accused’s evidence.
152      The first accused disagreed and pointed out that what he stated in Answer 10 was that the second accused told him that he had injured his leg “during the kicking”. This was consistent with his earlier evidence that the second accused had only told him that he was limping as a result of what happened the night before. The first accused took this to mean that his leg was injured during the kicking of the victim. He would not know whether the second accused’s leg was injured by him kicking someone or by someone kicking the second accused’s leg.
Court’s Ruling that the First Accused’s Credit has not been impeached
153      With respect to the discrepancy between the first accused’s testimony and Answer 4 of his fourth long statement (
P85
), I was of the view that this was a minor discrepancy that did not impugn on the first accused’s veracity and credibility. I accepted his explanation that, due to the interval of time between the incident and the trial, he could no longer recall exact details such as when exactly the second accused had informed him of his leg injury.
154      With respect to the inconsistency between the first accused’s testimony and Answer 10 of the fourth long statement, I accepted the first accused’s explanations. I further accepted his evidence that, at the coffeeshop, on the day after the incident, the second accused did not tell him that he had injured his leg when he kicked the victim. I noted that the first accused’s evidence on this point was corroborated by Mas’s evidence that, at the coffeeshop, the second accused did not indicate how his leg had been injured.
155      With respect to the discrepancies in the second long statement (
P84
), although the first accused accepted that his statement had been voluntarily given in that he could still choose what answers to give, he maintained that he had felt pressurized to give certain answers which were inaccurate, owing to the repeated questioning that he had been subjected to from the day of his arrest.
156      As noted by the High Court in 
Yusof bin Samad
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 4 SLR 58
, the courts have consistently held that persistent questioning, or even robust interrogation, is necessary for the police process and does not, without more, amount to oppression (
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1991] SLR 150
, 
Seow Choon Meng
 v 
PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 and 
Panya Martmontree
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
). A statement is said to be extracted by oppression only where the accused was in such a state that his will was “sapped” and he could not resist making a statement which he would otherwise not have made (
Public Prosecutor
 v 
Tan Boon Tat
 
[1990] SLR 375
). Similarly, oppression cannot be said to exist merely because the accused is tired, hungry and in a state of confusion when his statement is recorded (
Public Prosecutor
 v 
Tan Boon Tat
 
[1990] SLR 375
). Nevertheless, where the condition falls short of sapping the will, it can still have a bearing on the weight to be attached to the statement (
Yan May Woen
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2003] SGCA 29
).
157      The first accused testified that, from the day he was arrested, he had been subjected to repeated questioning, not only when he was brought out of the police lock-up, but also whenever officers went to him from time to time and interrogated him. During these interrogation sessions, prior to him giving his second long statement, the police officers repeatedly emphasized to him that Aziz, Eddie and the rest had kicked the victim, according to what Abdul Hadi had told them. The first accused gave evidence that, based on what the police told him, he therefore presumed that these persons named by the police had indeed been involved in the assault. On that assumption, the first accused therefore went along with the police and made statements concerning their involvement in the assault, even though he had not actually seen it. The prosecution did not call any witnesses to rebut the first accused’s claims of how his interrogation sessions had been conducted, whereby the police persistently disbelieved him and repeatedly confronted him with another witness’s statements until he agreed with the version presented to him.
158      Having had the benefit of observing the first accused’s demeanour as he gave evidence, and based on the facts and circumstances of this case, I found his explanations to be credible and I ruled that his credit had not been impeached.
First Accused’s cautioned statement (P64)
159      In the first accused’s cautioned statement, it was stated that a group of male Malays had got to the victim ahead of the first accused and Abdul Hadi, that this group then kicked the victim, causing him to fall to the ground and that the assault by the group had already started before the first accused ran off. In court, the first accused testified that this account given in the cautioned statement was not correct.
160      The first accused testified that, at the time when he gave his cautioned statement, he was not in a proper state of mind.
[187]
 
During the time when he was in police custody, he had been accused of many things which he had not done, such as gang robbery and gang assault.
[188]
 
At that time, his thoughts were preoccupied with the allegations made against him for robbery and assault, to the extent that he could not sleep at night.
[189]
 
As a result, when the charge for gang robbery was read to him and he was asked to make a statement in response to the notice of warning, he was not able to focus fully on the statement.
[190]
 
Although the account in the cautioned statement was substantially correct, some of the details were not correct. The first accused maintained that his evidence in court, in particular, on the details of when the group of male Malays had first come onto the road, was true and correct.
161      I noted that, in both the cautioned statement and the first accused’s testimony, the first accused had given an account of both the initial confrontation between him and the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza, and the subsequent assault on Coleman Street. The two accounts differed only in the details given.
162      Generally, by sheer force of logic, the cautioned statement, being a contemporaneous statement recorded within five days of the incident, should be accorded more weight than the first accused’s oral testimony at the trial. However, in this case, the details in the cautioned statement, which are materially different from those in the first accused’s testimony, have been shown to be the ones which are inaccurate.
163      For instance, in the cautioned statement, it was stated that the first accused and the victim had bumped into each other on Coleman Street. A viewing of the CCTV tape-recording, however, shows that this is inaccurate as the initial encounter had occurred along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza. Similarly, in the cautioned statement, it was stated that the group of male Malays had come onto the scene on Coleman Street before the first accused ran off, and in fact even before the victim fell down. The evidence of Abdul Hadi, a prosecution witness, however, was that the group of male Malays had approached him and the victim, only after the victim had fallen down and after the first accused had run off. There was hence independent evidence led by the prosecution to show the inaccuracy of these details given in the cautioned statement, notwithstanding its contemporaneity.
164      After a careful consideration of the evidence and having had the benefit of observing the first accused give evidence, I accepted the first accused’s explanations as to why he had made the mistakes in the details given in his cautioned statement.
Adverse Inference
165      In its closing submissions, the prosecution indicated that it was not applying to the Court to draw an adverse inference against the first accused under Section 123(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code for failing to mention in his cautioned statement about his fall and the retrieval of his watch. I was similarly of the view that it would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the first accused.
166      It is not in every case that an adverse inference will be drawn against an accused who keeps silent or who fails to mention a relevant fact upon being charged (
Public Prosecutor
 v 
Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 and 
Yap Giau Beng Terence
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
). The whole purpose of Section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code is to compel the accused to outline the main aspects of his defence immediately upon being charged, so as to guard against the accused raising defences at the trial which are merely afterthoughts (
Yap Giau Beng Terence
 v 
Public Prosecutor
).  An adverse inference will be drawn only if he fails to mention facts which he could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged (
Tsang Yuk Chung
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1990] SLR 107
).
167      In his cautioned statement, the first accused’s position was that he did not participate in the assault on the victim and that, at one point in time, he ran away from the scene. The details of how he had fallen down and retrieved his watch did not, in my view, amount to facts “which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed”.
168      I accepted the first accused’s evidence that he had failed to mention his fall and his watch because he was then not in a proper state of mind.
[191]
 
The cautioned statement was recorded from the first accused on the day of his arrest (on 31 May 2004), when he suddenly found himself accused of many things which he had not done. Nevertheless, according to the first accused, he did mention about his own fall on the road in his other statements. The first accused gave evidence that, prior to being brought to Court the next day (on 1 Jun 2004), he had also given many other statements, apart from this cautioned statement, to the police.
[192]
 
In some of these statements, he did inform the police that he had fallen down and that, after getting up, he had run back towards the 7-Eleven Store.
[193]
169      I further noted that the cautioned statement had been recorded, not by the first accused giving the statement on his own in response to the warning administered to him, but by him answering a series of questions posed to him by the recording officer.
[194]
 
This was especially true of the third paragraph, which contained the first accused’s account of both his initial encounter with the victim and the subsequent group assault. The details therein had been given by the first accused in response to specific questions posed to him by the recording officer.
[195]
  In other words, the details given therein were those which the recording officer was himself specifically interested to find out, rather than facts which the first accused had consciously decided on his own to include in his cautioned statement pursuant to the warning administered. Not only did the cautioned statement contain details to incriminate the others, it even contained useful leads to assist the police to establish their whereabouts (e.g. a statement on where the police could find Abdul Hadi’s telephone number, a statement that Aziz lived in Bedok North and a statement that the first accused could help the police to identify certain men).
The First Accused’s implied admission to Mas
170      Mas gave evidence that, at Aziz’s house, the first accused had asked her in a boastful manner whether she had seen him beat up the guy.
[196]
 
The learned counsel for the first accused then put it to Mas that the first accused did not ever say this to her. He, however, failed to lead any evidence from the first accused on his conversation with Mas when the first accused was in the witness-box. The first accused was also not cross-examined on this. The first accused’s evidence centred entirely on his three statements and his defence that he had not assaulted the victim on the road, although he did push or punch him earlier at the corridor of Peninsula Plaza.
171      As the defence failed to lead any evidence to rebut Mas’s allegation that the first accused had asked her this question at Aziz’s house, I treated her evidence on this point as unchallenged evidence. Nevertheless, in my view, great caution should still be exercised as to the amount of weight that could safely be placed on Mas’s evidence, in deciding whether to convict or acquit the first accused. As the Honourable the Chief Justice Yong Pung How noted in 
Kwan Peng Hong
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 4 SLR 96
,
“the trial judge must always bear in mind that the objective of the trial is to arrive at reasonable and safe findings of fact. In the absence of circumstances which generate suspicion, every witness is to be presumed to be credible, until the contrary is shown. … The trial judge must also bear in mind that, among other factors, the amount of credibility to be given to the witness depends mainly on his ability to discern and comprehend what was before him, … the degree of accuracy with which he was accustomed to marking the passing events, and his integrity or honesty in relating them.”
For the ability to speak the truth, the court should take into account, among other factors, the accuracy of the witness’s powers of discerning and the faithfulness of his memory in retaining the facts.
172      On the facts of this case, the evidence before the Court showed that Mas had been under the influence of alcohol to the extent that it materially affected her powers of observation, comprehension, retention and recollection of facts. First, there was evidence from a prosecution witness, Siti Aishah, that Mas was already high on alcohol when she first met her at the Chocolate Bar
[197]
. When they left the pub, although Mas could still walk on her own, she was already in a tipsy state
[198]
. The second accused similarly gave evidence that Mas was drunk by the time they left the pub.
[199]
 
Later, as the group fled from the scene, the second accused had to call upon Abdul Hadi to look after Mas as she was drunk.
[200]
 
This part of the second accused’s evidence was not challenged by the prosecution. It was not put to the second accused that Mas was not drunk.
173      Mas herself admitted that she had been totally intoxicated on that night.
[201]
 
Although, in re-examination, she attempted to qualify her admission by saying that she had not understood the meaning of the words “totally intoxicated” when she gave her answer, the rest of the evidence adduced before the Court pointed to her intoxicated state on the night in question. From 9 pm to 3 am, Mas had been drinking hard liquor with her friends at another club, followed by more drinking and dancing at the Chocolate Bar, with no intake of food.
[202]
 
In the witness-box, she could not recall many of the events of that night, including simple details like what drinks she had consumed at the first accused’s table, how many people were at his table, whether the second accused was among those at his table, whether she had gone into the 7-Eleven store with the first accused, or whether the second accused was with her and the other two ladies when someone shouted “Run”. Even on that night itself, Mas was also unable to remember simple details. For example, upon alighting from the taxi at Bedok North, when the first accused could not find his wallet, Mas could not even remember that the wallet had been handed to her for safekeeping in the taxi just moments ago. Thinking that the first accused must have dropped the wallet himself while alighting from the taxi at Bedok, she looked for it around Aziz’s house, when it was she who had held on to the wallet and dropped it inside the taxi.
174      According to Mas, the first accused had posed the question to her (on whether she had seen him beat up a guy) at Aziz’s house, where there was a group discussion. During this discussion, the group attempted to reconstruct the events. Mas conceded that her fatigue and tipsiness could have affected her ability to observe events around her.
[203]
 
Indeed, her recollection of the discussion at Aziz’s house was such that she even mixed up what she heard the others say with her own observations at Peninsula Plaza. In court, Mas admitted that, during the discussion at Aziz’s house, she received information which she had not observed but nevertheless presented to the Court as her own observations.
[204]
175      In any event, Mas’s evidence on the question posed to her by the first accused, did not necessarily point to the question being an implied admission by the first accused that he had participated in the group assault on the victim. The question could equally have been made with reference to only the initial confrontation between the first accused and the victim along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza.
Charge for Rioting
176      Section 146 of the Penal Code provides that :-
“Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.”
Section 141 of the Penal Code defines an “unlawful assembly” to be an assembly of five or more persons, having a common object which corresponds with one of the objects specified in paras (a) to (e) of Section 141. ‘Common object” must not be confused with the ‘common intention’ under Section 34 of the Penal Code (
Chandran
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1992] 2 SLR 265
). ‘Common object” is different from ‘common intention’ in that it does not require a meeting of minds before the attack (
Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 2 SLR 789
). Proof of a pre-arranged plan is hence not required. A common object must also be distinguished from a similar object. The same object only becomes common when all persons constituting the assembly are aware and concur in it (
Lim Thian Hor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
).
177      On the evidence adduced before me, I was satisfied that there were at least five persons with a common object of causing hurt to the victim. I accepted Borhanudin’s evidence that there were at least five men in the group that assaulted the victim on the road. I was also satisfied that violence had been used by the unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object.
178      It was with respect to the last requirement that I was not satisfied that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof. To be guilty of rioting, the accused must be proven to have been a member of the unlawful assembly. Section 142 provides that
“Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it, is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly.”
179      Mere presence in an assembly of persons does not make an accused a member of an unlawful assembly (
Lim Thian Hor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
). He is a member of the unlawful assembly only if he is aware of the common object and concurs in it (
Md Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed & Ors
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] SGHC 233
). Where there is evidence to show that the accused shared the common object of the assembly, it is not necessary to prove that all the members of the unlawful assembly knew each other (
Lim Thian Hor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
). Common object can also be formed on the spot (
Lee Tiaw Chwee
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR 563
).
180      As long as there is direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared the common object of the assembly, there is no need to prove an overt act against the accused (
Lim Thian Hor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
). Hence, in 
Osman bin Ramli
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 4 SLR 1
, where the appellant chose to remain at the scene with the unlawful assembly, when it became clear to him that the common object of the assembly was to cause hurt to the victim (when the group posed threatening questions to the victim and started the assault), the High Court held that the inference that the appellant shared in their common object was irresistible.
181      In 
Phua Song Hua
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] SGHC 33
, a group consisting of more than five men attacked the victim. The appellant was one of the men who surrounded the victim, but he did not participate in the attack. A policeman intervened and the matter was amicably resolved. Shortly later, the victim was attacked by the same group together with three more men. The appellant participated in the second assault. The appellant was then charged for two counts of rioting for the two attacks. For the first attack, the High Court held that an inference that the appellant had concurred with the common object of causing hurt to the victim could be drawn from the fact that he had chosen to stay with the group that attacked the victim and offered no special reason for doing so. This inference was strengthened by the appellant’s active participation in the second assault involving the same group of men.
182      In 
Lim Thian Hor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
, the first appellant stood by the side and did not participate in the assault. However, during the assault, he carried a hollow pipe and it was him who contacted his son who then came down to the scene and started the assault, before three unknown men joined him in attacking the victim. The High Court held that these facts raised an irresistible inference that the first appellant was a member of the unlawful assembly.
183      In the present case, I did not find Salamah’s identification evidence against the first accused to be reliable. The two accused persons’ credit was not impeached. The prosecution’s application to admit certain parts of their statements as evidence of the truth of the contents was not acceded to. There was instead the unchallenged exculpatory evidence of Abdul Hadi that the first accused had already started to run away before the group of male Malays came and joined Abdul Hadi in assaulting the victim.
184      I accepted the evidence of the first accused that he had run away when he saw the group of male Malays approaching him and the victim. The first accused’s running back towards the 7-Eleven Store was captured by the CCTV tape-recording. This is also shown in the lower right frame of photo 
P80
 (where the first accused is depicted as the second man from the bottom edge of the photo). It would appear that the first accused was the first person to run back from Coleman Street. When the tape is played, it confirms that the two men who were moving in front of the first accused in photo 
P80
 had not come from the group that assaulted the victim along Coleman Street.
185      I also accepted the first accused’s evidence that he had not asked the group to assault the victim. When he became aware of their impending approach and intentions, he made a conscious decision not to share in their common object of causing hurt to the victim by running away before they reached the victim.
186      This was hence not a case where the first accused, having been made aware of the common object of the group of male Malays, continued to remain at the scene during the assault. Rather, the first accused, having discerned the common object of the group, disassociated himself from that common object by immediately running away. The circumstances of this case are distinguishable from the aforementioned cases, where an inference that the accused had shared in the common object of the unlawful assembly could properly be made.
187      In coming to the decision that the first accused had not shared in the common object of the unlawful assembly, I had also drawn valuable guidance from the case of
Chen Jian Wei
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 2 SLR 255
.
 In that case, the persons who attacked the victims were the appellant’s friends. Prior to the assault, the appellant had been drinking and singing with these friends at a karaoke lounge, before he left them to go to a nearby pub. In the midst of the fight, the appellant went closer to the scene and watched at a distance of one to two metres for about 20 to 30 seconds before he felt increasingly uneasy about being at the scene and ran away. Similar to our case, the two victims in that case could not identify the appellant as being part of the group assault. There was also a prosecution witnesses who gave exculpatory evidence in favour of the appellant and stated that he was positive that the appellant was not involved in the group assault. Based on such facts, the High Court declined to draw an inference against the appellant that he had shared in the common object of the unlawful assembly.
Conviction on a charge for using criminal force
188      Although I found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case on the rioting charge against the first accused, I was satisfied that, based on the evidence adduced before the Court, a charge for using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code had been made out against the first accused.
189      The first accused admitted that he had used force on the victim when he confronted him along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza. The first accused who was then in a tipsy state could not recall whether he had pushed or punched the victim. The victim, on the other hand, who was adamant that he had not taken any alcohol at all that night, testified that the first accused had only used his elbow to push his stomach. Apart from this, the first accused did not hit or beat the victim. Borhanudin also corroborated the victim’s evidence on this point. Borhanudin was not an active participant in the incident but someone who had remained a bystander throughout the incident. He was, therefore, in a position to fully observe the events and his testimony should be given great weight.
190      After a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I convicted the first accused for having used criminal force to the victim, otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by the victim, by pushing his elbow against the victim’s stomach.
Antecedents
191      The first accused had two previous convictions for theft, and three previous convictions for failing to report for urine tests.
Mitigation
192      In his mitigation plea, the learned counsel for the first accused highlighted the fact that the first accused had no criminal history involving violence. Although he had drug-related antecedents, he had since given up his drug habit. He had further enrolled himself for a diploma in economics that would lead to a degree in business management with the University of London through Stansfield College. It was submitted that, since his last brush with the law, the first accused had made concerted efforts to reform and that he was deeply remorseful for his actions on the night in question. The defence pleaded with the Court not to impose a custodial sentence.
Sentence
193      The punishment prescribed for an offence of using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code is imprisonment not exceeding 3 months or a fine not exceeding $500 or both. When the offence involves only simple pushing, the sentencing tariff is a fine of $500.
194      In 
Eric Chew Seck Kheng
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No. 492 of 1993, unreported), the accused had suddenly rushed from behind the complainant and fiercely pushed his back with both his hands until the complainant hit against a car door. The accused also challenged the complainant to a fight. When the complainant tried to pacify the accused, the accused became more aggressive and started to push him again. Later, the accused even swung an umbrella at the complainant but missed him. After a trial, the accused was convicted, 
inter alia
, on one count of using criminal force on the complainant under Section 352. He was fined $500. On appeal, the conviction and sentence were upheld by the High Court.
195      In 
Public Prosecutor
 v 
Michael Gracia @ David Devito
 
[1999] 4 SLR 335
, the accused, whose dog had been bitten by the complainant’s dog, angrily confronted the complainant and shouted vulgarities at him. When the complainant apologized and walked away, the accused pushed him in the back, causing him to momentarily lose his balance. After a trial, the accused was convicted, 
inter alia
, for an offence of using criminal force and sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. The High Court, in exercising its revisionary powers, reduced the sentence to a fine of $500.
196      In this case, I accepted the first accused’s evidence that he had not deliberately picked a fight with the victim. He had confronted the victim after the two of them had bumped into each other. At the material time, the first accused was in a tipsy state, after six hours of drinking at the coffeeshop and the Chocolate Bar. When he thought he heard the victim retort back in response to his question, he pushed the victim. Apart from this push and holding the victim at one point by the shirt, he did not do anything else to the victim. Although he did chase the victim when the latter started to run, he did not join Abdul Hadi to assault the victim.
197      The first accused could not be made constructively liable for Abdul Hadi’s punching of the victim, both along the corridor and along Coleman Street. To invoke Section 34 of the Penal Code, there must be a prior meeting of the minds. Although the common intention can develop on the spot during the commission of the offence, it is crucial that it precedes the act which constitutes the offence (
Too Yin Sheong
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1999] 1 SLR 682
). I accepted both the first accused’s and Abdul Hadi’s evidence that Abdul Hadi’s act in giving the victim one punch along the corridor of Peninsula Plaza was a spontaneous act that was done entirely on his own. There was no prior meeting of the minds. Common intention is also to be distinguished from similar intention (
Shaiful Edham bin Adam & Anor
 v 
Public Prosecutor
 
[1999] 2 SLR 57
). Similarly, in my view, the circumstances surrounding the subsequent assault by Abdul Hadi along Coleman Street, including, in particular, the first accused’s conduct in not joining Abdul Hadi but instead running away immediately, could not be said to give rise to any irresistible inference that Abdul Hadi’s act had been committed in furtherance of a common intention between them both.
198      Having been convicted for an offence of using criminal force, and not for rioting, the first accused ought to be punished for his own acts. The offending act by the first accused was a simple push with the elbow on the victim’s stomach. The first accused only had antecedents for theft and failure to report for urine tests. He did not have any antecedents for offences involving violence or disorderly behaviour. This was his first conviction for using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code.
199      On the facts and circumstances of this case, I was of the view that a fine would be appropriate. Accordingly, I imposed the maximum fine of $500 or in default one week’s imprisonment on the first accused. The fine was paid in full.
200      The prosecution is dissatisfied with the order of acquittal on the charge under Section 147 of the Penal Code against the first accused, and the orders of conviction and sentence on the charge under Section 352 of the same Act and now appeals against them.

V K Rajah J:
1          On 12 March 1997 at about 9.00pm, a loud bang was heard in the vicinity of Ban Seng Eating House (“Ban Seng”) at Block 4, Beach Road. At about 9.11pm, the police were notified that a man had been found lying in a pool of blood at the car park located at Block 4, Beach Road. A police team was immediately dispatched to the scene. No signs of life were detected in the body when it was examined by an ambulance officer at 9.25pm. The police later established the identity of the dead man as Tan Tiong Huat (“the deceased”), a rather notorious illegal moneylender who practised his trade in the Golden Mile area primarily amongst Thai nationals and those having business dealings with them.
2          An autopsy performed on the following day by Associate Professor Gilbert Lau (“AP Lau”) revealed that the cause of death was a disruptive intracranial injury with consequential severe haemorrhaging. AP Lau was of the view that the injury was caused by a low calibre gunshot fired from a slightly elevated position. This opinion was predicated on the slightly descending trajectory of the bullet, which passed right through the deceased’s skull. Neither the bullet nor the revolver employed in the incident has been recovered.
3          Soon after the incident, the police received information that the accused was involved in the incident. All efforts to track down the accused proved to be unsuccessful. Investigations revealed that the accused had left Singapore for Thailand on 31 March 1997. The police nevertheless proceeded to finalise their investigations.
4          One witness had particularly relevant information. At the request of the prosecution, I have directed that the name of this witness be concealed. I shall refer to him only as “PW21”. PW21 had met the accused at the car park next to the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority Building (“ICA Building”) on either 9 or 10 March 1997. During this meeting, the accused disclosed to PW21 his intention to kill the deceased within the next seven to ten days. The accused expressed his anger and deep distress over the deceased’s conduct towards him; he felt the deceased had treated him as “a nobody”. The accused had earlier borrowed a few thousand dollars from the deceased. Their relationship had soured badly as a consequence of the deceased’s allegedly unreasonable and persistent harassment in seeking repayment of this loan. PW21 also stated that the accused showed him what appeared to be the butt of a gun tucked at the right side of the accused’s waist. According to PW21, the accused had called him about a week after the incident claiming that the police already knew that he was the one who killed the deceased.
5          Shortly after the accused met PW21, he had a separate conversation on the very afternoon of the fateful 12 March 1997 with a certain Tham Boon Hua (“Tham”) at Ban Seng. Tham was a casual acquaintance of the accused and conversed with the accused from time to time when they ate meals at Ban Seng. Again the accused bitterly complained about his displeasure over the deceased’s conduct towards him after the accused had obtained loans from him. The accused asserted he could “not tolerate … anymore” the harassment of the deceased. He stated in a matter-of-fact manner that he intended to “rob” the deceased. As the accused did not appear to Tham to be his “usual self”, Tham advised him not to do anything foolish. The accused also lifted his shirt when he said he had “something” to rob the deceased with. Tham, however, did not observe what was under the shirt.
6          The accused is the last known person to have met the deceased. He acknowledges that he arranged to meet the deceased on 12 March 1997 at a coffee shop in Block 4, Beach Road. He had arrived at the coffee shop between about 8.00pm and 8.30pm that night. The accused states that he arranged for the meeting to effect repayment of the loans he had taken from the deceased in order to open a garment shop at City Plaza.
7          The accused waited for the deceased for a while near the entrance to the car park at Block 4, Beach Road, The deceased arrived at the car park at about 9.00pm.
8          The accused admits that he had in his possession a 0.38 calibre revolver, smuggled in from Thailand, until about two to three days before the incident. He claims however that the revolver was lost shortly before the incident. He asserts that while he was with the deceased, a mystery gunman suddenly emerged. He maintains that this mystery gunman shot the deceased and promptly fled the scene. While he denies having killed the deceased, he claims to have left Singapore nevertheless to avoid trouble; he had received news that the police were looking for him in connection with the killing.
9          The accused maintains that all inculpatory statements he had earlier made to the police acknowledging his solitary role in the killing of the deceased were involuntarily given. He claims that though he was present when the deceased was shot, he was not responsible for killing the deceased, who was his “best friend” and “financial supporter”.
The police statements
10        Upon leaving Singapore in 1997, the accused proceeded to Thailand. Soon after arriving in Thailand, he ran afoul of Thai law and was incarcerated until 30 September 2004, when the Thai authorities handed him over to a police team from the Singapore Criminal Investigations Department (“CID”).
11        The accused was accompanied from Bangkok by a team of four CID officers headed by Senior Station Inspector Zainal Abidin (“SSI Zainal”). They arrived at Changi International Airport at 5.00pm and thereafter proceeded to the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”). They arrived at the PCC at 5.50pm. SSI Zainal thereafter directed Station Inspector Roy Lim (“SI Roy”) and Station Inspector Han Khoe Juan (“SI Han”), who were both part of the investigating team, to interview the accused. The fourth member of the team, Senior Station Inspector Shen Yen Ek (“SSI Shen”) was not present during the interview. In the course of the interview, the accused informed SI Roy and SI Han that he was prepared to make a statement. At about 7.25pm, SI Han left the interview room and SI Roy alone recorded the accused’s statement. It is undisputed that no caution pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) was administered to the accused prior to the recording of this statement.
12        SI Roy reduced the accused’s statement into writing, after which he read the statement back to the accused. The statement was both recorded and read back to the accused in English. That the accused has an adequate command of English was amply illustrated by his verbal exchanges with others, as well as comments he delivered from time to time in court in English during his testimony. All the accused’s subsequent statements were however made in Hokkien through interpreters. Nothing critical turns on his linguistic abilities, as the defence has not complained of any impediments or confusion created by linguistic difficulties. For good measure, however, I find as a fact that he has the ability to effectively communicate his thoughts, and understood all communications he had with the CID officers, in English.
13        SI Roy and SI Han have asserted that no threat, inducement or promise was made to the accused by them or anyone else before the initial statement was recorded. According to SI Roy, the recording of the statement concluded at about 8.25pm. The accused signed the statement, affirming that it was “true and correct”. He has however sought to retract it. As this particular statement takes centre stage in the prosecution’s case and is now refuted by the accused, it would be helpful to reproduce the statement in full (“the original statement”):
I am the one who do it. I am the one who shot him with a 0.38 revolver.
Before 1997, as I always go to Golden Mile Complex at Beach Road and I go to know him. We became friends. I later also found out that he was “Ah Long” (term used for illegal money lenders). At that time, I was having money problem and I borrowed S$8000/- to open a shop to sell clothing at City Plaza, #03-07. I had to pay him back S$9600/- including interest. As we were friends, I only paid him in instalments when I have the money.
I think I remember about 1 or 2 weeks after I borrowed the money from him, I returned him about a thousand dollars. I do not remember was it the 2
nd
 or 3
rd
 instalment that I could not return him money because I got no money. Due to this, he called my shop everyday to ask for money. There was once, my wife happen to answer the phone and he shouting and scolded my wife because I did not give him money.
I saw my wife crying and asked her what happened. My wife told me about ‘Ah Seng’s’ call and after hearing that ‘Ah Seng’ scolded my wife in bad word, I got angry.
 
A few days later, I contacted ‘Ah Seng’ and asked him to wait me at Blk 4 Beach Road. I will give him money. I cannot remember what day was that. I think I told him to meet me at 8.30pm.
I cannot remember when I bought the revolver, but I bought it from Thailand for 15000 baht. I put the revolver in raw sticky rice bag and brought it through the checkpoint in Singapore by bus. I also don’t know what I bought the gun.
So after hearing that he used ‘four languages’ on my wife, I decided to use the gun on him. I reached Blk 4 Beach Road earlier than 8.30pm and I placed the gun on the grass near a tree to hide it
. This was just opposite the [K]allang [R]iver. The gun was wrapped in newspaper.
Ah Seng only came at about 9pm. 
The moment he arrived, we quarrelled and he scolded my parents
. I then gave him S$2300/- but he still not satisfied and scolded my parents. 
I get angry because he scolded my parents.
 I then tell him to wait for me there and I will go get more money in 5 minutes time.
I walked to where I hide the gun and took it. It was very near Ah Seng. I just took the gun in my right hand and walked towards Ah Seng. His back was facing me. I did not care so much whether people see or not because I am angry already. When I was right behind him, I pointed the gun at the back of his head and fired one shot. Immediately, he fell forward on the cement pavement and I saw that he was not moving
. It was very dark there. I then tucked the gun in between my pants and stomach and walked to my bicycle which was parked at the same place. I cycled just to the main road and from there, I abandoned my bicycle and took a taxi to [W]aterloo [S]treet. I did not even look back to see whether any people heard or saw anything.
At [W]aterloo [S]treet, I took the Malaysian taxi and went straight to Johore [B]ahru. As the checkpoint does not check passengers in the taxi, I went through woodlands checkpoint without any problem with the gun on me. At Johore Bahru, near Wong Ah Fook [S]treet, I threw the gun in a small river near a small carpark. The water in the river was full.
At about 1am or so, I came back to Singapore and returned home to my wife at Geylang. I then went to the toilet and flush all the bullets into the drainage pipe in the bathroom.
I still stayed in Singapore for sometime until I heard rumors (sic) that the Police was looking for me regarding Ah Seng’s death. Immediately, [I] decided to leave the country and I took a bus to Thailand. I have been in Thailand since then until I was sent back to Singapore today.
I feel regret for him for what I’ve done to him. After my confessing and now the truth is out, I feel more comfortable. It’s not stuck inside me anymore
.
[emphasis added]
14        Three points ought to be emphasised in relation to the original statement. First of all, the entire interview process lasted only about two and a half hours from the time the accused arrived at the PCC. Secondly, it is undisputed that the accused was not shown any photographs, site plan, autopsy report or other materials prepared in relation to the incident prior to the recording of the original statement. Thirdly, the original statement was made in relation to an incident which took place some six years earlier. The level of detail in relation to the incident itself is striking for its unaffected prose and familiarity with pertinent facts.
15        The next day, the accused was officially charged with the murder of the deceased pursuant to s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). He declined to make any statement after the statutory caution was read out to him. Instead, he informed Assistant Superintendent Christopher Jacob (“ASP Jacob”) and the police interpreter that he would “explain it in court only” and inscribed the following cryptic message in Mandarin on the written caution: “
shui luo shi chu
”. This literally means “when the water subsides, the rock will emerge”. I shall refer to this document as “the cautioned statement”. The police interpreter stated in evidence that the words were intended to convey that “there will come a day when the facts will be revealed” but could also be interpreted to mean “the truth will come to light later”.
16        Subsequently, the accused made several further statements in Hokkien, translated to SSI Zainal with the aid of another police interpreter, both clarifying and expanding on matters raised in the original statement (“subsequent statements”). He accompanied police officers on site visits to the scene of the incident, as well as on a side trip to Johore Bahru to indicate the spot where he “threw” away the revolver. The last of these subsequent statements was recorded on 13 October 2004. In that statement, the accused concluded by expressing remorse. He said:
I regret killing him. It was never my intention to kill him
. I had only wanted to teach him a lesson
. That is all. [emphasis added]
17        Shortly after this, from 22 October 2004 to 12 November 2004, the accused was remanded at the Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre for a psychiatric evaluation. Dr Stephen Phang (“Dr Phang”), Deputy Chief of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry, interviewed the accused in English on three occasions while he was there. Dr Phang noted that the accused experienced no difficulty in recounting what transpired seven years ago in 1997. At this point, however, the accused denied “gunning down this man” (the accused’s own words are set within quotation marks in this paragraph). Instead, he claimed that a mystery gunman had appeared while he was with the deceased. This mystery gunman alone had shot the deceased. The accused claimed that “I was so astonished, that I don’t know how to scream out”. He also asserted that he had lost his revolver two to three days prior to the incident. After the incident, he left for Thailand only because he heard “rumours” that the police were seeking him in connection with the case and not because he had done anything improper.
18        The defence has relied on the statements made by the accused to Dr Phang to demonstrate that he had consistently maintained his innocence after leaving the PCC. The accused claims that 
all
 the statements made by him to the police (“the police statements”) while he was held at the PCC were involuntarily made.
The 
voir dire
19        At the hearing, the accused alleged that several CID police officers had made various threats and offered various inducements and promises, both in the course of his return flight from Bangkok to Singapore as well as during the interview held on 30 September 2004 on the 18th floor of the PCC. Defence counsel has maintained that as a result of oppressive conduct on the part of the CID officers 
prior
 to the original statement, all subsequent police statements were involuntarily made as well, and ought to be deemed inadmissible.
Alleged oppressive conduct
20        The accused asserts that when he was about 15 years old, he had his first unpleasant encounter with police officers. He claims that having been “falsely accused” of stealing a motorcycle, he was assaulted while in custody. As a consequence of this incident and other unpleasant brushes with the law, he professes an apprehension and mistrust of CID officers. The accused insists that he was very tired before the interview took place. Anxiety had robbed him of sleep when he remained incarcerated in Thailand pending the handover to the CID officers.
21        The accused claims that on the flight from Bangkok to Singapore SI Han had asked him, “Ang Kong Ngee, what did you do seven years ago, did you kill this person?” When the accused denied that he had, SI Han had allegedly said, “you better tell your father (meaning SI Han) the truth” and “if you were to co-operate with us and tell us what actually went on and how it happened we will help you back during your court case”. Finally, SI Han is supposed to have stated that if the accused did not “tell … the truth … don’t complain if we don’t treat you like a human being”.
22        The accused claims that SI Han spoke very softly out of fear that the other passengers might hear him. The accused claims SI Roy then came up to him and unbuttoned three buttons on his shirt, looked at the accused’s tattoos and said “he is the one”. The accused further maintains that SI Roy’s actions signalled to him that the officers had ascertained that he was responsible for the murder and that he would definitely be hanged as a result.
23        Upon arriving at the PCC, he was purportedly brought to an office on the 18th floor. The escorting officers then placed their luggage in their cabinets, after which the accused was taken to the interview room. In the room, there were five officers: SSI Zainal, SSI Shen, Station Inspector Erulandy Guruthevan (“SI Guru”), SI Han and SI Roy. The accused claims that shortly after this, SI Guru, followed by SSI Shen, left the room. SSI Zainal then spoke to the accused.
24        According to the accused, SSI Zainal said that he “better tell the truth, you killed this person”. The accused denied that he had killed the deceased. SSI Zainal then told him, “if you didn’t kill then who else would have done it”. The accused asserts he once again denied killing the deceased, saying he did not know who did it. SSI Zainal allegedly responded by saying he had to “handover the gunman”. When the accused said he was unable to do so, SSI Zainal purportedly said, “if you did not know and if you are unable to hand over the one who fired the gun, then you would have to eat this piece of shit”, meaning he would have to take responsibility for killing the deceased. The accused says that he repeatedly denied to the CID officers that he had shot the deceased.
25        SSI Zainal then allegedly stated that if the accused admitted to the murder, the charge would be reduced from murder to manslaughter and the accused would then only have to serve a few years in prison. The accused asserts that neither SI Roy nor SI Han said anything at this point.
26        According to the accused, SI Roy also reiterated a number of times that they were on the 18th floor of the PCC. The accused took this to imply that SI Roy would throw the accused from the 18th floor if he did not admit to the killing. SI Roy also informed him that the CID officers would not be able to sleep if they accused someone wrongly. The accused claims that though he initially maintained his innocence, eventually he decided that it was futile to continue denying “responsibility”. He therefore accepted SSI Zainal’s deal and confessed. The accused also asserts that the “threat” by SI Roy to throw him down from the 18th floor played a part in persuading him to “confess” in the original statement.
27        The accused also adds that he never mentioned the existence of the mystery gunman wearing the Thai hat to the CID officers because he mistrusted them and “knew” that they would not believe him.
28        It is also contended by defence counsel that the statements recorded after 30 September 2004 (including the cautioned statement) were made by the accused under the inducement of the deal that SSI Zainal had offered. The accused adds that on 18 October 2004, SSI Zainal scolded him whilst asking him to identify the gun that he had used. SSI Zainal then allegedly directed him on how he ought to identify similar looking revolvers from a chart. The accused says that on 19 October 2004, he took SSI Zainal on a “wild goose chase” to Johore Bahru, believing that if he told SSI Zainal that he had in fact lost the gun as opposed to throwing it away in Johore Bahru, then SSI Zainal would have “beat the living daylights out of me”.
29        It is pertinent to point out that a good number of the accused’s allegations are founded on suppositions and assumptions that were not inspired by any threat of harm, direct or indirect, to his well-being or person. Nor has he complained of any physical abuse while he was at the PCC. Indeed, when he mentioned to ASP Jacob that he had not had a bath, arrangements for him to have a bath were promptly made.
Applicable principles in relation to “voluntariness”
30        When a statement given pursuant to the provisions of the CPC is challenged on the issue of its voluntariness, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it has indeed been voluntarily obtained: see 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
, 
Tan Too Kia v PP
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 187
.
 In 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 (“
Panya Martmontree
”) at 349, [29], Karthigesu JA succinctly summarised the position thus:
What, in our view, is required of a trial judge in a voir dire is to decide whether the evidence of the accused alleging inducements, threats, promises or assaults, taken together with the prosecution’s evidence 
has raised a reasonable doubt
 in his mind that the accused was thus influenced into making the statement … [emphasis added]
and at 350, [32]:
The fourth appellant, it seems to us, goes too far when he submits that the 
slightest suspicion of an inducement
, threat or promise or of an assault is sufficient to rule out a statement under s 122(5) of the CPC. [emphasis added]
31        It is axiomatic that the essence of voluntariness is a question of fact; see 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1976] AC 574
 at 600.
32        It is also settled law that the test of voluntariness comprises elements of both objectivity and subjectivity. An actual threat, inducement or promise must be found to factually exist. Having established that, the facts must be carefully scrutinised to determine whether the threat, inducement or promise operated on the mind of the accused during the material period, inspiring either the hope of escape (whether partial or full) or fear of punishment in relation to the actual or prospective charge; see 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
; 
Sharom bin Ahmad v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 565
.
 In the final analysis, the court will review all the circumstances of the case in determining whether there were any reasonable grounds for the accused to assume that he would receive any benefit or avoid any punishment: see 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
.
 If a threat or inducement is indeed found to have been made, then the prosecution must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the original threat or inducement had effectively dissipated when the statement(s) in question were made: see 
Lim Sing Hiaw v PP
 
[1965] 1 MLJ 85.
  It is not incumbent on the prosecution, however, to prove that there is no lurking shadow of doubt or minute vestiges of fear in the mind of the accused before a statement is recorded: 
Panya Martmontree
 at 349 and see s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).
Evaluation of allegations
The incidents on the plane
33        I have rejected the accused’s allegations of oppressive conduct and inducement that were levelled against the CID officers. I shall deal with each of the main allegations now; first, the accused’s version of what transpired on the plane is inconsistent. Indeed, defence counsel had to concede “my client is not very clear, it is in the plane” in response to my query as to when the incident took place. Earlier in the hearing, defence counsel had unhesitatingly stated that SI Roy’s act of unbuttoning the accused’s shirt occurred “in flight”. I find it most implausible that SI Roy could have done this, as such an act would have been easily observed by the flight crew and even perhaps passengers. It is also most unlikely that any of the CID officers would have sought to upset the accused during the flight as this might have culminated in an unnecessary commotion on the plane. In any event, the accused admitted that he did not feel threatened by this alleged act of unbuttoning. He had supposedly felt “insulted”. Secondly, his complaint apropos SI Han underwent some serious modifications in the course of the hearing. He seemed to suggest that SI Han had also said that “he was the one”. This was not put to SI Han. During his examination-in-chief, the accused claimed that SI Han had threatened him in a “soft voice”. This was said perhaps to rationalise why the others present did not hear the threats. This rather important point was again not put to SI Roy, SI Han and SSI Shen to elicit their response as to its veracity and foundation.
The interview on 30 September 2004 at the PCC
34        Apart from these brief incidents, the defence contended that the other acts of intimidation took place primarily before or in the course of the interview at the PCC on 30 September 2004. The accused had confirmed with Dr Phang that he was not physically attacked, manhandled or threatened by the CID officers. He had said that the officers had intimidated him verbally and “they force me to admit, they, four, five mouths, I one mouth how to fight”.
35        It is plain that SI Guru and SSI Shen had very little meaningful contact with the accused. Defence counsel, to his credit, did not pursue any unfounded allegations against them. It also emerged during cross-examination that SSI Zainal and SI Han did not take the lead in interviewing the accused. The principal interviewer was SI Roy. The assertion to Dr Phang that he was “forced to admit” by “four, five mouths” was entirely without foundation or substance.
36        In the course of cross-examination, SSI Zainal was asked to produce his field diary. The defence appeared to be attempting to establish an evidential beachhead to undermine SSI Zainal’s claim that he did not interview the accused and/or was not present during the interview. In so doing, the defence was hoist by its own petard. SSI Zainal’s field diary corroborated his version of events.
37        In the course of cross-examination, the accused acknowledged, albeit reluctantly, that the alleged threat to throw him off the 18th floor of the PCC building by SI Roy was pure speculation on his part. This allegation against SI Roy is without substance, both in law and in fact. First, it is settled law that a self-perceived threat without a reasonable basis does not amount to a threat within the rubric of s 122(5) of the CPC: 
Lu Lai Heng v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 251
.
 Secondly, I am not persuaded that there was any legitimate basis for this rather fanciful flight of imagination even if the accused’s version of events was correct. Thirdly, and most importantly, I am inclined to accept the contrary testimony proffered by SI Han and SI Roy on this and the other relevant issues. They gave their evidence throughout the proceedings in a forthright and consistent manner and were unshaken in cross-examination.
Interaction with SSI Zainal
38        The accused repeatedly asserted that he mistrusted all police officers. He also confirmed that he mistrusted SSI Zainal right at the outset. In light of this, I cannot see how any purported promise made by SSI Zainal could have influenced him in any material or meaningful sense. The accused further admitted during cross-examination that when he supposedly agreed to the purported deal with SSI Zainal to confess in return for a reduction of the sentence, he “
never believed
” that SSI Zainal would keep his word. Finally, he also conceded during cross-examination that even before the recording of the statement by SI Roy, he “was alert and conscious to the trickery of SSI Zainal”.
39        It bears mention that on the very next day after the accused had made his original statement, ASP Jacob charged him with the capital offence of murder. Despite this, the accused continued to give a number of statements until 13 October 2004. ASP Jacob noted that the accused was composed during their time together. He did not detect any signs of fear or intimidation on the part of the accused. No complaints were made by the accused to the reviewing medical officers during his pre- and post-statement medical examinations on 1 October 2004. The accused concedes that there were no further threats or inducements made after 30 September 2004. It is also most significant that he made no mention of any “deal” to any third party – not even to Dr Phang with whom he appeared to be completely at ease. I have also taken into account the evidence of Ms Toh Bee Choon (“Ms Toh”), the police interpreter who accompanied the accused on his field trip to the site of the incident and interpreted all his subsequent statements. She testified that the accused appeared to be relaxed and made “small talk” with her on a number of occasions. I have concluded without any diffidence that there was no “deal” made with SSI Zainal that he would arrange to have the charge reduced. I have also accepted SSI Zainal’s evidence as being truthful.
40        I conclude my review of the accused’s allegations of improper conduct against the police officers with a final observation. The accused can hardly be described as a babe in the woods who might easily succumb to fear or intimidation. He is an experienced street operator used to the rough and tumble of life. As such, I do not think that he would have made the original statement so soon after he returned to Singapore, virtually at the commencement of the interview, unless he had voluntarily intended to do so. This by his own admission was not his first encounter with police officers and he did not strike me as a man who could or would be easily broken.
Legal objections to admissibility of accused’s police statement
41        Aside from the issue of 
de facto
 voluntariness, the defence also raised legal objections in relation to the admissibility of the original statement. Defence counsel asserted that prior to the recording of the original statement on 30 September 2004, a “warning” pursuant to s 121(2) of the CPC was not administered to the accused. Additionally, it was alleged that while ASP Jacob administered a caution pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC to the accused when he was charged on 1 October 2004, SSI Zainal failed to administer any warning or caution to the accused when all subsequent statements were recorded. It was also argued that SI Roy failed to record in writing in the original statement that there was “no threat, inducement or promise” made before and/or during the recording of the statement. The prosecution contended that while these contentions were factually correct, they were legally irrelevant to the issue of the admissibility of the statements.
42        I agree with the prosecution. First of all, it is now settled law that a statement of an accused will not be rendered inadmissible on the basis that s 121 of the CPC has not been literally adhered to: see 
PP v Mazlan bin Maidun
 
[1993] 1 SLR 512
 at 518, [23]. The Court of Appeal has also held in 
Mohamed Bachu Miah v PP
 
[1993] 1 SLR 249
 at 266, [50] that the only circumstance where a statement made by an accused “whether in police custody or not, may not be admitted in evidence is where it is tainted by inducement, threat or promise”. Section 121 of the CPC does not address the issue of admissibility of statements made in the course of police investigations. The admissibility of statements to the police is broadly addressed by s 122 of the CPC. In my view, s 121(2) of the CPC does not impose a positive obligation on the police to inform suspects or accused persons that they may decline to answer a question that may incriminate them. Section 121 of the CPC purely imposes an obligation on the person being questioned to tell the truth subject to the proviso permitting him to maintain his silence on matters that may be personally incriminating. The Attorney-General, Mr Chan Sek Keong, has correctly observed in 
The Criminal Process – The Singapore Model
 (17 Sing L Rev 433 at 488) that:
The privilege can exist as a constitutional right without a separate duty to inform. The right to counsel exists as a constitutional right, but no one has suggested that this right is infringed if the police fails to inform an arrestee of such a right. Indeed, section 29 [Evidence Act] provides that a confession if relevant does not become irrelevant merely because he has not been warned that he was not bound to make such an answer.
I should perhaps add, for completeness, that the bundle of legal rights relating to the questioning of suspects enunciated in 
Miranda v Arizona
 384 US 436 (1966), that defence counsel was inarticulately relying on, is not part of our legal jurisprudence; see also 
Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP
 
[1988] 1 SLR 815
 at [16]. That said, it would of course be quite improper for a police officer to inform a person being questioned that he is obliged to tell the truth without concurrently informing him of the effect and purport of the proviso. If a police officer misleads a suspect or an accused as to his legal obligations, and this has a material bearing on the making of a statement, the court has an overriding discretion in determining the admissibility of such a statement: see 
Cheng Swee Tiang v PP
 
[1964] MLJ 291
 and 
PP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa
 
[1996] 1 SLR 783
.
 This is not the case here. I am satisfied after evaluating the evidence that the police officers neither threatened the accused that he 
had
 to tell the truth nor misstated his legal obligations.
43        Secondly, I agree with the prosecution’s contention that the failure to specify expressly in writing in a statement that it has been procured without any improper threat or inducement does not in itself render the statement 
ipso facto
 inadmissible. The presence or absence of such words is not conclusive or even 
prima facie
 evidence of what had actually transpired during the interview phase of the police investigations. In the ultimate analysis, regardless of any verbal or linguistic formulae adopted in the police statements, it is for the court to determine 
factually
 whether the statement in question was voluntarily obtained. The burden remains with the prosecution, irrespective of the presence or absence of any words testifying to the voluntariness of the statement, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that such statement was indeed voluntarily obtained without any inducement, threat or promise apropos the accused.
Analysis of evidence pertaining to the incident
44        All the police statements were therefore duly admitted in evidence. In the statements, the accused had with unwavering clarity and convincing detail acknowledged killing the deceased on the evening of 12 March 1997 at the car park of Blocks 3/4 Beach Road, Singapore. The statements also supply a wealth of information relating to the reasons precipitating the accused’s decision to discharge a firearm at the deceased.
45        Most of the factual issues in these proceedings are incontrovertible. It is undisputed that:
(a)        the deceased was an illegal moneylender;
(b)        the accused had borrowed money from the deceased which the deceased was vigorously pressing him to repay;
(c)        the deceased had used profanities on at least one occasion on the Thai common-law wife of the accused, reducing her to tears. The accused was deeply upset by this;
(d)        the deceased made it next to impossible for the accused to carry on with his new business and effectively caused him to sell it off. The accused suffered a substantial financial loss as a consequence;
(e)        the accused made unequivocal threats in relation to the deceased to two witnesses – PW21 and Tham. Indeed, the accused acknowledges that he informed PW21 that he intended to kill the deceased. This happened just two to three days before the incident;
(f)         the accused had a revolver with bullets which he had illegally smuggled into Singapore from Thailand;
(g)        the accused invited the deceased to meet him at the site of the killing; and
(h)        the accused was the last person known to have seen the deceased alive.
46        The defence contends that PW21’s evidence was equivocal as he could not confirm whether the gun was real or fake. The accused also claims that after he lost his gun, he had bought a fake plastic gun and this was what PW21 had seen; he maintains that he intended PW21 to see the fake gun in order to convey the impression that it was “real” to the deceased. He claims the purport and intent of this “charade” was to intimidate both PW21 and the deceased. This is a rather remarkable concoction. First of all, the accused had no reason to believe that PW21 and the deceased were in regular communication. Secondly, the accused did not ask PW21 to convey such a message to the deceased. Indeed, he conceded in cross-examination that he would not know if PW21 ever conveyed any such message as he had intended. My impression of the accused is that he would not, in any event, have picked such a roundabout method to convey such a message. He would have either expressly informed PW21 to convey the message or informed the deceased directly. If the intention was to merely intimidate the deceased, why did he not simply show him the fake gun when they met on the evening of 12 March 1997? Indeed, his brief discussion with Tham on the afternoon of 12 March 1997 reinforces my view that he was determined to harm the deceased. While he had told Tham he wanted to “rob” the deceased, it is pertinent that Tham observed that the deceased was not his “usual self”. There was no suggestion from defence counsel that the accused had also “intended” Tham to convey the purport of the discussion to the deceased. I should also add that as both Tham and PW21 are in my assessment forthright witnesses who were unshaken in cross-examination on all material issues, I have accepted their evidence. In so far as PW21’s evidence differed from the accused’s recollection of what happened at the ICA car park (see [4]), I have chosen to accept PW21’s evidence over the accused’s.
The subsequent police statements
47        I now deal with the subsequent statements – the series of police statements which the accused made after the original statement. With the exception of the cautioned statement, that is to say the brief reservation made when the accused was officially charged (see [15] above), these were all made either at the scene of the incident or after visiting it. The subsequent statements essentially expanded or clarified what was stated in the original statement. It is pertinent to point out that while there are indeed some differences between these statements and the original statement, such discrepancies are in my view neither fundamental nor critical.
48        In an attempt to accentuate and play up these differences, the defence contends that these “inconsistencies” were “silent cries for help” deliberately planted by the accused in order to demonstrate in court that the various acknowledgements of responsibility for the killing were, intrinsically, involuntary and incorrect. In response to a query from the court, defence counsel confirmed that the contents of the police statements were the result of a “measured thought process” and were “accurately recorded”. Notwithstanding such a stance by his counsel, the accused in cross-examination took the incongruous position that he did not know if the police statements accurately recorded what he had stated.
49        After considering the various allegations made by the accused, I unequivocally rejected such a belated attempt on his part to resile from his statements. On the contrary, the converse is true. The various statements demonstrably pointed to the truth, rather than the falsity, of the confession. It is neither surprising nor disquieting that the accused made a number of clarificatory statements after he visited the scene. It appears that he took some time to re-orientate himself before clarifying matters. I am satisfied that there was no attempt by the relevant officers to dictate to him what was recorded in the various statements. What is particularly significant is that the defence accepted, once the police statements were admitted, the veracity and accuracy of almost all the material contents of the various statements. Indeed, the evidence given by Ms Toh about several corrections to the statements made in consultation with the accused was unchallenged by defence counsel. These corrections were endorsed by the accused and he appended his initials to indicate his acceptance. The police statements correctly articulated the position of the accused at the relevant points of time. After I admitted these police statements, the only two issues that defence counsel disputed were the facts in the statements acknowledging his possession of the gun around the time of the incident and the account of what happened in the Beach Road car park at the material time in so far as it related to the retrieval and use of the gun.
50        I pause here to deal with a rather conspicuous discrepancy in the accused’s new version of events as proffered during the hearing. The defence had at the outset resolutely maintained that the accused did not tell the police of the existence of the mystery gunman because he felt they would not believe him; furthermore, he insists he had been pressurised into accepting responsibility for the killing. Annexed to a statement he made on 6 October 2004 after the site visit is a sketch plan drawn by the accused. In this sketch plan, the accused indicated where he had hidden the gun and the path he had taken in order to retrieve the gun before he shot the deceased. He also drew two figures. The larger figure was referred to as “Ah Seng” (the deceased’s nickname) and the smaller figure as “I” (himself). When he was initially cross-examined, he insisted that the smaller figure was the mystery gunman:
Q:         … So the letter “I”, the alphabet “I” is in relation to the small figure of a man?
A:         They are not related. On the day when I wrote the letter “I”, what I meant was that I actually took the path as indicated by the dotted lines on this sketch.
Q:         All right. So as far as this diagram is concerned, the big figure is the deceased, “Ah Seng”?
A:         Yes.
Q:         The small figure is the shooter?
A:         Yes.
Q:         And the “I” refers to the dotted path---the path you took?
A:         Yes.
After intensive cross-examination he appears to have realised, albeit a little tardily, that his responses were both inconsistent and implausible. He then resiled from this new position, asserting that “there are so many things in the statement, it is impossible to recall every detail”. In my view, he changed his evidence yet again because it struck him subsequently that this new unrehearsed assertion in court blatantly contradicted his primary assertion that there was a mystery gunman which he had deliberately not disclosed to the police. The accused is clearly not a credible witness on the material portions of the police statements which he later attempted to retract.
The alleged loss of the gun
51        The accused also admits that he had possessed a gun which he had obtained in Thailand and brought into Singapore illegally by concealing it in a sack of glutinous rice. In the course of the trial, he related how he had allegedly lost his gun. He had purportedly left the gun and the bullets under his folded hammock in a storage box at the back of his bicycle (“storage box”). He parked the bicycle at Golden Mile Complex two to three days before the fatal shooting. He was not sure whether he had locked the storage box. He then went up to Golden Mile Complex to make some purchases to sell to his customers. When he came back, he placed the purchases into his storage box and he proceeded to distribute them at Geylang. He only realised that his gun was stolen later that night when he took out his hammock to lie on it. He claims he felt “frustrated” when he discovered the loss.
52        This is yet another incredible invention. Apparently, neither the bullets, cash nor any other item was removed! Unfazed by the loss of a real firearm, the accused then allegedly proceeded to purchase shortly thereafter a fake firearm. If the accused is to be believed, it follows that he purchased a fake firearm with the sole intention of showing it to PW21 to intimidate him and the deceased and to deter them from harassing him for the repayment of his outstanding loans. It is odd, to say the least, that he never showed this fake firearm to the deceased. Indeed, the accused was remarkably silent as to what became of this fake firearm and exactly how he intended to employ it when he met the deceased.
53        He also unguardedly conceded in cross-examination that the storage box was easy to “pry open” and as there was money in it “wherever I go, whenever I park my bicycle, I would definitely be around there to keep a lookout on my bicycle”. Completely contradicting his confounding tale of the “sudden” disappearance of the revolver, he unwittingly acknowledged how he always maintained careful scrutiny over his valuables in the following exchange:
Q:         But, Mr Lim, you can’t always be near your bicycle to prevent people from stealing your merchandise, your goods and all that, right?
A:         
No, if I were to leave my – walk off from my bicycle, I would bring along my moneys. I’ll bring along my money and the gun
.
Q:         And the gun. I think I remember you saying that when you stayed overnight at Dah’s place, you would leave the gun in your jeans and hang it in the cupboard, is that what you did?
A:         Yes.
Q:         So you did take precautions?
A:         Yes. When I’m in the room, I would keep the gun in my jeans and hang it inside the cupboard.
[emphasis added]
I am satisfied that the accused took adequate precautions to ensure the safety of his valuables and the revolver. I have concluded that he had not lost the revolver shortly before the incident as he claimed, but that he had possession of the revolver at the material time.
The mystery gunman
54        The defence’s present version of what transpired on the evening of 12 March 1997 surfaced after the accused resiled from his original statement: see [17] above. The deceased was angry and abusive when they met. He grabbed the accused’s shirt but did not assault him. He hurled vulgarities at the accused. The accused returned $2,300 to him. The deceased was not placated and continued to mouth obscenities at not only the accused but his parents as well. The accused then asked the deceased to wait while he retrieved a further $1,000 from the storage box. At that point, someone emerged from behind the deceased and shot him in the back of his head. This “big sized” man was wearing a dark shirt and, on his head, a Thai straw hat. The man ran off quickly after shooting the deceased. The accused explains that he did not assist the deceased as he was afraid of being implicated in the shooting. This was despite the fact that the deceased was in his books his “best friend” and “financial supporter”!
Observations on the defence
55        I have carefully scrutinised the evidence as well as the contentions of the prosecution and the defence. I have no hesitation in rejecting the accused’s wholly unmeritorious attempt to retract material portions of his unequivocal police statements acknowledging responsibility for the killing of the deceased. His current account of how he lost his revolver and how the mystery gunman suddenly materialised is not just implausible – it is utterly illogical. It is wrapped around an illusive edifice wholly fabricated by desperation. One need not only to stretch one’s imagination but to suspend disbelief altogether to accept the accused’s tale of how he lost his revolver. I dismiss this version of events as being not only improbable but wholly concocted as an afterthought. Why would anyone remove a revolver from the accused’s bicycle box and yet leave bullets and other valuables intact? Why did the accused keep the bullets after “losing” the revolver? How would the mystery gunman have fortuitously learnt of the private meeting that the accused had arranged with the deceased? These are just some of the numerous inherent and irreconcilable inconsistencies in the altered version of events proffered by the accused at the trial.
56        The defence has accepted that the police statements constituted a confession to the offence on which the accused was being tried. Counsel however submitted that the police statements should be accorded little weight because they were inconsistent on material facts. There was furthermore no “strong” corroborative evidence of the confessions. Such a submission is without merit. It would be helpful at this juncture to briefly state the legal position in relation to retracted confessions. It has been authoritatively stated in 
Yap Sow Keong v PP
 
[1947] MLJ 90
 at 91 (approved by the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Ismail bin U K Abdul Rahman v PP
 
[1972–1974] SLR 232
 at 236, [18]) that:
… the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions in evidence is clear, and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth. We do not agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on his retracted confession there must be corroborative evidence to support it”.
57        The court need only be satisfied that first, the confession was voluntarily made, and secondly, that it was true and reliable: 
PP v Huang Rong Tai
 
[2003] 2 SLR 43
 at [22]. It is therefore incorrect for the defence to contend that “strong” corroborative evidence of the retracted confession is an essential prerequisite to a conviction of the accused. In any event, quite apart from being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the police statements truthfully recorded the essence of what transpired during the incident, I am persuaded that PW21’s and Tham’s evidence as to the accused’s intention to harm the deceased constitutes cogent corroborative evidence of portentous significance.
58        I accept what the accused stated in the original statement as reflecting the essential truth as to what transpired on that fateful night on 12 March 1997. I have concluded that the accused had the gun with him just before he met the deceased. He hid the gun. It is acknowledged by the defence that the deceased abused him verbally when they met. That is not all – the deceased also pulled his shirt aggressively. His festering resentment and deep anger towards the accused for having earlier insulted his common-law wife, for causing him severe business loss and for treating him like a “nobody” culminated and exploded in incandescent rage. He resolved to deal with the deceased once and for all. He stealthily sought his gun and shot the deceased in the back of his head. When he shot the deceased, he was standing behind him in a slightly elevated position.
59        While there are some wrinkles in the slightly different accounts the accused had given as to what happened on that fateful night, it is crystal clear that he was deeply upset with the deceased even before they met that evening. The verbal abuse heaped upon him by the deceased, compounded by the rough physical handling dished out to him, became the proverbial nail that literally nailed the deceased’s coffin. I categorically reject the defence that the alleged discrepancies in the police statements were inarticulate “cries for help”. Indeed, the different nuances and level of detail in the various statements serve to fortify the prosecution’s case that the police officers were at pains to accurately record the accused’s version of events, rather than to inflict upon him their hypothesis of what transpired. While the accused’s confession in the original statement took centre stage in the prosecution’s case, all the police statements bore the hallmarks of truth and reason. In the original statement as well as in the last of his subsequent statements, the accused expressed remorse over killing the deceased. At the hearing however, the accused claimed that these words were not his words but were inserted by SI Roy and SSI Zainal. Inexplicably, this rather important point was once again not put to the two CID officers.
60        In the circumstances, I conclude that there was no mystery gunman. I find that the bullet that killed the deceased came from the accused’s revolver. I find that the accused fired the revolver. The revolver was fired at the deceased with the intent to cause physical injury to him.
61        I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the prosecution has made out against the accused the charge pursuant to s 4(1) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14, 1998 Rev Ed) and I accordingly convict the accused of this charge. I impose on the accused the sentence of capital punishment which is mandatorily prescribed for this offence.

Introduction
1          Truth, it has been said, is stranger than fiction. This is nowhere better exemplified than in the present proceedings. Indeed, if a label were necessary, the entire saga could not inappropriately be entitled “Of Stray Dogs and Accidents”. As we shall see, it would not be inaccurate to add “, With Experts” as well.
2          It was a clear night along Tampines Avenue 10 on 8 September 2003 at approximately 9.15pm. The plaintiff had just completed what appeared to be a regular jog around Bedok Reservoir and was returning to his company premises. He had presumably done this numerous times before. Tonight, he also had two “companions”. They were two stray dogs that had somehow become “part” of the company in which he worked. They were in fact two of a larger group of approximately six dogs. In the nature of things, they belonged to no particular person, let alone the company. Not formally, in any event. But they had a “relationship” of sorts with the company and were, in fact, periodically fed and even bathed by employees in the company (albeit not by the plaintiff).
3          The dogs in question obviously recognised the plaintiff. Indeed, he stated that when the dogs spotted him going for a jog, they would occasionally “accompany” him. This was one such occasion. As we shall see, one of them is alleged to have played a crucial role in the present proceedings – at least in so far as the defendants are concerned.
4          So much by way of a brief prologue. The actual events which are the subject matter of the present hearing are unfortunate in more ways than one. This should not be surprising as this case involved a traffic accident.
5          There are, not surprisingly once again, two versions of the accident in question. Both are of course diametrically opposed to each other. What is clear is that the accident involved an SBS Transit Bus (“the bus”, which was driven by the first defendant) and a pedestrian (the plaintiff), as well as one of the stray dogs. The bus had collided into both pedestrian and dog at a traffic controlled junction along Tampines Avenue 10. The issue before the court was whether or not the bus driver or pedestrian or both were at fault.
6          I found that the first defendant was substantially to blame for the accident and apportioned liability in the proportion of 80% to 20% in favour of the plaintiff. The liability of the second defendant, the first defendant’s employer, is therefore also established accordingly and in the same proportion. The defendants are dissatisfied and have appealed against my decision. I now give the detailed reasons for my decision.
The plaintiff’s evidence considered
7          The plaintiff
[1]
 
claims that he was just starting to cross Tampines Avenue 10 when the bus concerned failed to stop at the junction in question and negligently collided into him as well as one of the dogs. More importantly, he claims that the traffic lights were green in his favour and red as against the bus.
8          As a result of the accident, the plaintiff sustained severe injury, especially to his leg. Unfortunately, the dog was killed. The left side of the windscreen of the bus was badly shattered. Fortunately, though, neither the bus driver nor any of the passengers on the bus was injured.
9          According to the plaintiff, he had proceeded to the traffic junction in question and waited for the cars on his side of the road to stop and for the green man to appear before he crossed the road. He had only noticed the bus when he had stepped onto the road; in his words:
[2]
When I stepped onto the road proper, I turned and looked toward my right and I saw the bus.
10        The plaintiff also clarified that the cars in the other two lanes had already stopped when he first saw the bus which was travelling in the extreme left lane. He also stated that the bus was approximately 8m away from him when he first saw it. He further stated that the bus was coming at him at a very fast speed.
11        When asked by counsel for the defendants, Mr Salim, why with the bus about 8m away when he (the plaintiff) first saw it travelling at a fast speed, he thought it would stop, the plaintiff replied thus:
[3]
Because the cars in the first and second lanes had stopped and the green man had come on, so it had to stop.
12        The plaintiff admitted, under cross-examination by counsel for the defendants, that whilst looking at the other cars in the other lanes coming to a stop, he did not look at the first lane (the lane in which the bus was travelling and onto which the plaintiff stepped and where the accident took place). In his words, “[w]ithin my scope of vision, there was no car”.
13        More importantly, in answer to counsel for the defendants’ question as to whether or not 
before
 he stepped onto the road, he (the plaintiff) had looked to his right towards the first lane, the plaintiff answered “No”.
14        There then followed what, in my view, was an important exchange between counsel for the defendants and the plaintiff, extracts of which are now reproduced:
[4]
Q:         Before you stepped onto the road, did you look to your right towards lane 1?
A:         No.
Q:         Why not?
A:         Because the cars on the second and third lane had stopped and the green man had appeared.
Q:         But as a prudent pedestrian, wouldn’t you first check whether all the cars had come to a stop, especially the car which would be closest to you before you start crossing?
A:         No.
Q:         Can you explain? A prudent pedestrian shouldn’t even look?
A:         The cars in the second and third lanes had already stopped and the green man had appeared and that was the time when as a pedestrian I can cross.
Q:         If you had looked at lane 1 before crossing, do you agree you could have seen the bus?
A:         Yes.
Q:         If you had seen the bus which was occupying the lane closest to you, you most probably wouldn’t have crossed the road, right?
A:         Yes.
15        Although the plaintiff’s testimony in this regard was detrimental to his case inasmuch as it was clear evidence of contributory negligence on his part, I was impressed by the fact that he, nevertheless, did not attempt to evade counsel for the defendants’ questions. This was, in fact, representative of his basic attitude and demeanour throughout. I found the plaintiff to be straightforward and a witness of truth.
16        Another crucial aspect of this case in general and the plaintiff’s testimony in particular centred on two related aspects – the relationship between the plaintiff and the dead dog and the precise actions of the dog, respectively. Both these aspects are inextricably linked together and are best described as well as analysed as a whole.
17        I note, at the outset, that the fact that the plaintiff did not attempt in any way to evade this issue with respect to his relationship with the dog confirms my earlier observations to the effect that he was a reliable witness of truth. Indeed, when I asked him if he recognised this particular dog, he answered in the affirmative, stating that the various dogs could be distinguished by their different shapes and colours.
[5]
18        It is clear from the evidence that there were 
various degrees
 of relationship between the other employees of the plaintiff’s company (including the plaintiff) on the one hand and the group of stray dogs which considered that company a “home” of sorts on the other. For example, some employees would even go to the extent of giving the dogs concerned periodic baths.
[6]
19        The plaintiff’s own relationship with the dogs was somewhere in-between. He mentioned that, on occasion, albeit not always, one or more dogs might follow him when he jogged (as was this case on this particular occasion).
[7]
 
He also mentioned that he would occasionally give them food. Specifically, in answer to my question to clarify what his relationship was with the dogs, the plaintiff replied, “If there is leftover food, I will give it to them.”
[8]
 
Would this, however, entail the plaintiff risking his life chasing after the dog who suddenly (as the first defendant alleged) dashed across the road?
20        I have dwelt on the relationship between the plaintiff and the dogs, particularly in the context of his jogging routine, at some length because it is the defendants’ (in particular, the first defendant’s) case that the plaintiff had dashed out suddenly onto the road and into the path of the bus that he (the first defendant) was driving, 
against
 the traffic lights, in order to chase after (and save) the dog which had dashed out onto the same road moments earlier.
21        The relationship between the plaintiff on the one hand and the stray dogs (in particular, the dead dog) on the other is therefore a crucial link in this particular case. This did not, however, seem to me to be a relationship that would entail the plaintiff risking his life chasing after the dog who suddenly (as the first defendant alleged) dashed across the road. Besides, the dog was not on a leash. It was, after all, a stray dog. There was some mention of a collar but the evidence here was inconclusive although I am of the view that it was, in any event, by no means a collar that contained a dog licence. Again, it bears repeating that this was a stray dog. Hence, logic and common sense lead to the inexorable conclusion that the dogs in general and the dead dog in particular were allowed to do as they wished.
22        Indeed, it would not be stretching one’s imagination to say that, if the defendants were right in their allegation with respect to the plaintiff’s self-sacrificial love for the dogs, the plaintiff must have risked his life many times for the sake of the dog’s safety on the roads and it is incredible that he had not hitherto met with an accident. If, in fact, the plaintiff had been so solicitous of the dogs’ safety, he ought to have put them on a leash each time they accompanied him for a jog. But what if, as the plaintiff himself stated, there was more than one dog (which the first defendant himself alleged to be the situation here)? More importantly, why would the plaintiff wish to encumber himself with one or more leashes for the dogs when it appeared that his sole purpose was to jog unencumbered by anything – let alone dogs on leashes? It is true that it is possible that if a dog were very well trained by its master, it might not require a leash when accompanying its master on jogs or walks. However, it is clear that the plaintiff did not have that degree of closeness to the dogs in general and the dead dog in particular.
23        There is also the 
first defendant’s
 allegation that there was a 
second
 dog, which had “crossed” the junction earlier. Why did the plaintiff not ensure that both dogs were together and why did he not risk his life to chase that (second) dog? Perhaps it had run on ahead – as did the (first) dog. Indeed, the first defendant’s allegation with respect to the second dog only reinforces my conclusion above to the effect that the plaintiff’s relationship with the dogs generally was a very loose one and, 
a fortiori
, could not even remotely be described as being of that level of self-sacrifice which must be present if the first defendant’s version of the accident is to be believed.
24        It follows that the first defendant’s version of the accident – in particular, that the plaintiff had suddenly dashed across the road to chase (and presumably “retrieve”) the (first) dog – is inherently improbable and against the weight not only of the evidence and context but also common sense.
25        It is appropriate to note, at this juncture, that counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Yap, had in fact objected to the defendants including this version of the accident (
ie
, that the plaintiff had suddenly dashed across the road in pursuit of the (first) dog) in evidence as it did not arise on the pleadings. In the light of my findings, I find it unnecessary to deal with this particular objection.
26        It is, however, necessary to turn now to analyse the first defendant’s evidence in order to ascertain whether or not, notwithstanding the relative strength of the plaintiff’s case up to this point in time, the overall strength of the defendant’s evidence is such that his (the defendant’s) case ought nevertheless to prevail.
The first defendant’s evidence considered
27        The plaintiff’s and the first defendant’s respective accounts as to how the accident occurred are as different as proverbial chalk and cheese. The plaintiff was adamant that he was merely waiting to cross the road and did so when the green man came on. The first defendant, on the other hand, maintained that the plaintiff had dashed across the road against the traffic lights which were green in his vehicle’s favour, presumably to save the dog which had itself dashed out onto the road moments earlier. In particular, the first defendant maintained that the traffic lights were green in his favour and that it was the plaintiff who had suddenly dashed out in front of the bus he was driving as the bus itself crossed the white stop line, chasing after the dog which had dashed out a moment earlier.
28        The main thrust of the first defendant’s case is clear and is confirmed by his very own words as italicised below (at [32]). Clearly understanding its underlying sequence as well as logic is of the first importance. The first defendant claimed that the traffic lights were in his favour and that he kept a proper lookout. If this was so, the only way he would be totally blameless would be if the plaintiff had suddenly dashed out from the kerb and into his path in running after the dog, giving him no time to avoid a collision with both the dog as well as the plaintiff.
29        When asked by counsel for the plaintiff what he would do when he approached a junction, the first defendant maintained that he would take his foot off the accelerator and be prepared to brake. The first defendant also maintained that he was travelling at a speed of 40km/h. He also stated that he had kept a proper lookout as his vehicle approached the junction where the accident took place. Looked at in this light, it was crucial to the first defendant’s case that the plaintiff had been running after the dog at the pedestrian crossing and the first defendant admitted, under cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff, as much (and see the words italicised at [32] below).
[9]
 
Presumably, the suddenness of the actions of both dog and plaintiff gave rise to the accident and absolved, so the argument went, the first defendant from any legal blame. However, as a point of pleading, counsel for the plaintiff was at pains to point out that this fact had been mentioned neither in the first defendant’s police report nor in the Defence itself. This is a point to which I have in fact already dealt with above (see [25]).
30        The first defendant also stated that he had seen another dog run across the road whilst he was still a distance away. This was, allegedly, another dog which had run across the junction prior to the first dog which the first defendant’s bus subsequently collided into. I pause here to observe that, if this was so (and it is significant that the point was being made by the 
first defendant
), then it is strange that the plaintiff had not seen fit to run after this (second) dog as well. There was in fact no evidence as to whether or not the plaintiff preferred one dog over the other. Indeed, as I have already observed above, there was a very simple answer to the questions posed in this paragraph and which I have already dealt with in some detail above (see [17]–[22]). Put simply, it is that the plaintiff really did not care especially about the dogs. To be sure, he did not mind them following him on his jogs, but he certainly did not, on the available evidence, demonstrate any degree of supervision, let alone self-sacrifice, for them.
31        The first defendant’s evidence, it will be seen, still rested, in the main, on his evidence to the effect that the plaintiff had suddenly rushed across his path in pursuit of the dog which had also rushed across his path a moment earlier. The importance of this argument was underscored by the following exchange between counsel for the plaintiff and the first defendant:
[10]
Q:         When you approached the junction where the accident took place, did you notice the plaintiff?
A:         No, I didn’t. I did keep a lookout.
Q:         Did you notice the plaintiff?
A:         No.
32        A little later on in the same exchange, the following exchange occurs:
[11]
Q:         In other words, you weren’t paying attention to the possibility of anyone crossing the junction?
A:         I didn’t notice that.
Q:         
You have through your solicitors put forth a line of defence that the plaintiff was running after the dog at the pedestrian crossing. Is it important for your defence that the plaintiff was running after the dog at the pedestrian crossing?
A:         
It is
.
[emphasis added]
33        
However
, as I have held earlier, when considering the plaintiff’s evidence, this particular argument is inherently improbable and against the weight of the objective evidence and, indeed, common sense. Looked at in this light, his other arguments (briefly set out above) are, with respect, mere assertions.
34        It is important to pause here to note that the first defendant’s demeanour was not 
obviously
 one that suggested unreliability or evasiveness. On balance, however, I found him to be a less reliable witness than the plaintiff. In particular, his responses were apparently well rehearsed – especially with regard to his deliberate and repeated emphasis on the safety measures laid down by his employers (the second defendants) and which he had (allegedly) adhered to. I also note that the witness demonstrated an almost “plateau-like” demeanour in response to the various questions posed to him, particularly in cross-examination. Indeed, it might be stated that the witness was unnaturally “calm”.
35        In any event, it should be noted that whilst the factor of demeanour is an important ingredient in the process of ascertaining a particular witness’s credibility, it is not a fail-safe. In situations such as the present, where the witness’s demeanour is not obviously inferior to that of the other party, the 
objective factual matrix and the objective credibility in the witness’s own account of the material events
 may – and, here, did – tip the scales. Given the fact that the entire process, particularly the ascertainment of the witness’s demeanour, even at first hand, is not a scientific process, the infusion of a not insignificant measure of objectivity in the form just mentioned may not only be desirable but may even be imperative.
36        Turning to the specific facts of the present case, it bears repeating that the main crux of the defendants’ case centred on the suddenness with which both the dog and the plaintiff had appeared like a bolt from the blue although the traffic lights were in the first defendant’s favour. As I have already stated, given the overall evidence, this argument was inherently incredible.
37        Finally, it is also significant to note that the first defendant admitted, in cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff, that there was, behind him, a full height driver’s partition which was opaque and through which passengers could not see.
[12]
 
He also confirmed that this partition was slightly wider than his seat, albeit not almost half of the width of the bus as suggested by counsel for the plaintiff.
[13]
 
He further confirmed that there were both vertical poles in the middle of the bus as well as horizontal handrails along the vertical poles.
[14]
 
This evidence was very relevant as it impacted on the line of vision or sight of the passengers who were his witnesses and whose evidence I consider below (see generally at [60] 
ff
).
The evidence of the witnesses considered
38        It must be stated at the outset that, for various reasons set out below, I found the testimony of the witnesses to be rather unsatisfactory.
The evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses considered
39        There were three witnesses for the plaintiff and I turn now to consider their respective evidence.
40        Turning, first, to the testimony of Mr Lim Chuee Wat (“PW1”), an independent witness on behalf of the plaintiff, it was clear that he was a reluctant witness. He was clearly uncomfortable in a court setting and took a while to become “acclimatised”. He also appeared to be a little taciturn by nature. This explained the seeming contradictions in his initial testimony – particularly with regard to the position of his car in relation to the bus driven by the first defendant. In addition, the reference by counsel for the defendants to various roads and landmarks without (for the most part) furnishing any real context could also have confused the witness and would most certainly have exacerbated an already difficult situation in so far as PW1 was concerned.
41        More importantly, the following exchange between PW1 and counsel for the defendants perhaps explains why the former’s testimony smacked, as already mentioned, more of reluctance than enthusiasm:
[15]
Q:         When did the plaintiff ask you to give evidence?
A:         I often met Thomas [the plaintiff’s colleague] who said [his] friend [
ie
, the plaintiff] wanted to ask me to be his witness. 
I declined because I was afraid it was troublesome. But subsequently I agreed
.
Q:         When and why did you agree?
A:         About a few months after the accident because I was an eyewitness and was asked to help.
[emphasis added]
42        Although this particular witness did not appear enthusiastic, to say the least, I cannot accept counsel for the defendants’ submission that, according to his client, the witness had never been at the scene of the accident and that his evidence was therefore a total fabrication. Indeed, his testimony was infused with his own natural characteristics, as described briefly above, and, to that extent, appeared therefore to be infused simultaneously with the ring of truth. Hence, I find that PW1’s testimony supports the case for the plaintiff.
43        The plaintiff’s second witness was his colleague
,
 Mr Teo Leong Hui (“PW2”, and also known as “Thomas” (see [41] above)). He was in fact instrumental in locating PW1, whom he claimed he did not know but whom he had seen previously at the coffeeshop.
44        PW2 claimed to have arrived at the scene of the accident at around 9.30pm. Although PW1 had testified that he had not spoken to PW2 at the scene of the accident, the latter maintained that such a conversation did in fact take place.
45        Counsel for the defendants sought to cast doubt on PW2’s testimony by querying the latter’s decision to inform the plaintiff about PW1 only six months after the accident, despite visiting the plaintiff at the hospital and also having the means to phone him (the plaintiff) earlier.
46        PW2 also shed some light on the relationship between the stray dogs and the employees of his company.
47        In response to a question by counsel for the defendants, PW2 responded thus:
This dead dog was very friendly. It did not have a particular owner. There are many stray dogs. This dog would follow us.
48        And, in response to questions with a view to clarification from the bench, PW2 gave the following answers:
[16]
Ct:        Witness said dog was quite friendly – what was the relationship like between the workers and the dog?
A:         Sometimes if we have extra food we would feed it – sometimes I or the plaintiff or someone else would bathe the dog.
Q:         Would you give orders to the dog?
A:         When I’m free I will play with the dog.
Q:         Is the dog obedient?
A:         Quite. Whether or not it obeys depends.
49        PW2’s evidence, in so far as the stray dogs are concerned, is wholly consistent with that given by the plaintiff and which has been described briefly above.
50        I found PW2 to be a witness of truth. Although he did not inform the plaintiff about PW1 earlier, he appeared to me to be a rather reserved man who, whilst knowing the plaintiff, would not naturally take the initiative to approach the plaintiff. Indeed, PW2 stated that he informed the plaintiff about PW1 only after next meeting the plaintiff after he had been discharged from the hospital and he (the plaintiff) visited the company premises.
51        The plaintiff’s remaining (third) witness was an 
expert witness
, Mr Liaw Leong San Jayson (“PW4”). Unfortunately, I did not find either the report by, or the evidence of, this witness particularly helpful. This was, I hasten to add, not due to any fault on the part of the witness himself. This was due, in the main, to the fact that the accident itself was, in essence, “simple”, albeit with unfortunate results, especially where the plaintiff was concerned.
52        The most helpful evidence given by PW4 was in fact given during re-examination by counsel for the plaintiff. In response to a question by the latter as to whether the crack on the windscreen of the bus driven by the first defendant would be a telltale sign of the speed at which the bus was travelling at the material time, PW4 expressed the view that it was 
not
 a 
low speed
 impact (
ie
, in his view, one in the range of less than 40km/h).
[17]
 
PW4 further testified that the spot where the windscreen of the bus was shattered was “about the height of a man”.
[18]
53        In response to a question by counsel for the defendants as to whether or not his view would be any different if he had learnt that there had been no glass fragments or debris, PW4 responded in the negative; in his view:
[19]
Not necessary for the glass to fall off. If there were fragments the speed would have been even higher. [emphasis added]
54        In 
summary
, the overall evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses was persuasive, albeit not compelling. However, it is clear that the evidence did not contradict the plaintiff’s own evidence and, in some ways, did in fact buttress it.
The evidence of the defendants’ witnesses considered
55        In addition to the first defendant,
[20]
 
there were six witnesses for the defendants and I now turn to consider their evidence.
56
       
 The defendants’ first witness was Ms Chong Mui Fong (“DW1”). She was in fact the investigating officer. She helpfully produced both a sketch plan as well as photographs. She also confirmed that there had been no skid marks, brake marks and no glass fragments or other debris at the scene of the accident.
[21]
57        The evidence of DW1 was helpful inasmuch as the photographs, in particular, clearly confirmed that the left side of the windscreen of the bus was badly shattered. This, in turn, clearly confirms that the bus had collided into the plaintiff not long after he had stepped off the kerb.
58        The fact, however, that there were no skid marks, brake marks or other debris at the accident is understandable in view of the fact that the first defendant’s bus had collided into a pedestrian, the plaintiff.
59        The defendants’ second witness was Mr Jeffrey Lim.
[22]
 
He was the service manager for Tyco Building Services. He explained the traffic light sequence for the junction in question. Whilst helpful, what is crucial is the precise positions of the respective vehicles. Unfortunately, it was by no means clear what these positions were. Indeed, where the first defendant’s bus was at the material time was itself (as we have seen) a fact in dispute. Not surprisingly, counsel for both the plaintiff as well as the defendants tendered diametrically opposed arguments based on the traffic light sequence.
60        The defendants’ third witness was Ms Suraiya d/o Hj Chrag Din (“DW4”). She was one of two witnesses who were passengers on the bus driven by the defendant at the material time. It is significant, in my view, that the witness was seated on that side of the bus that was blocked by the full height driver’s partition. Further, the witness was behind her son whom she admitted was taller than she. In so far as this last-mentioned point was concerned, the witness stated that her son was “seated slanted”.
[23]
 
The view from this particular vantage point was anything but clear. Added to this was the fact that the witness had bent down to retrieve a sweet for her daughter who was sitting beside her. Despite the fact that the witness insisted that she had seen the traffic lights and that they were green in favour of the bus in which she was travelling, this was yet another distraction. Even allowing for the fact that the witness was (unfortunately) feeling a little unwell at the time she gave her evidence, the overall factual matrix did not comport with her version of events, especially since she had been distracted and her line of sight was far from clear.
61        The fourth witness for the defendants was the second of the two passengers on the bus, Mr Abdol Talib bin Jaffar (“DW5”). This particular witness, like DW4, was sitting on the same side of the bus as the driver, the first defendant in the present proceedings. His line of sight was therefore also impaired, in my view. The response by the witness to a question by counsel for the plaintiff during cross-examination was thus rather strange:
[24]
Q:         You seem to have the habit of observing traffic lights and traffic conditions at the junctions? Is that a habit of yours?
A:         At that time I was going to work, so while I was sitting I looked straight. When I was looking in front I saw the traffic light.
62        Again, bearing in mind that the full-height driver’s partition was in fact opaque, the following response by DW5 during cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff was, with respect, less than convincing:
[25]
There were obstructions, I agree, but that did not block my view altogether. Also, the partition behind the driver, it was a glass panel. I could see the driver and his head also.
63        At this juncture, the very pertinent observations by Julie E Bates & John T Bates, “Accident Reconstruction” (1988) 55 Defense Counsel Journal 437 at 443, are apposite (in so far as the evidence of the third and fourth witnesses for the defendants is concerned):
Witnesses sometimes think they see things that were not possible for them to see. Because an unbiased witness often has such a persuasive impact on a jury [the writers were writing in the US context], the reconstruction expert can be vital in proving … precisely what happened, in spite of the contradictory testimony of an eyewitness.
64        Indeed, the importance of the 
objective
 evidence and factual matrix cannot be over-emphasised.
65        The fifth witness for the defendants was Mr Tan Young Hwai.
[26]
 
He gave evidence with respect to the 
speed limiter
 on the bus the first defendant had been driving which apparently limited the speed of the bus to 60km/h (and see generally the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Speed Limiters) Rules (Cap 276, R 39, 2001 Rev Ed)). However, even if I accept that the bus could not have exceeded 60km/h, the fact of the matter was that the speed limit at the material time was 50km/h. It also does not confirm at 
what
 specific speed the defendant was driving the bus. Still less does it confirm whether or not the traffic lights were in favour of the first defendant.
66        The sixth and final, witness for the defendants was Mr Tay Beng Hee (“DW7”). He was in fact the defendants’ 
expert witness
. Like the plaintiff’s expert witness (PW4), I did not, with respect, find either his report or evidence particularly helpful. Indeed, the evidence I found most helpful, which was the VCD which was made by DW7, confirmed my view above (at [60] and [61]–[62], respectively) to the effect that it would have been extremely difficult for DW4 and DW5 to have had a clear view of the traffic conditions in front of the bus in which they were travelling. DW7 attempted to get round awkward questions put to him by counsel for the plaintiff in relation to this particular difficulty but, I am afraid, with little success.
[27]
 
In fairness to this particular witness, though, what I had observed earlier with regard to the plaintiff’s expert witness (PW4) holds true for DW7 as well. And it is that the comparatively “simple” factual scenario left little room for the introduction of substantive expert evidence which was truly helpful as such (
cf
 also 
Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore
 vol 10 (Butterworths Asia, 2000) at paras 120.238 and 120.241).
67        In 
summary
, the overall evidence by the defendants’ witnesses was not very helpful to their case at all. In the circumstances, we are cast back to the quality of 
the first defendant’s
 evidence, which I have already considered above (at [27]–[37]) and which I in fact consider unsatisfactory.
A note on expert evidence
68        It is important to ascertain what precisely constituted the 
basis
 for the respective expert reports (and see generally Jeffrey Pinsler, 
Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process
 (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at pp 185–187, 553–554 and 646–647;

 (Sweet & Maxwell, 1990) at pp 136–138; and Ian Freckelton & Hugh Selby, “The Basis Rule” in Ian Freckelton & Hugh Selby, 
The Law of Expert Evidence
 (LBC Information Services, 1999) at ch 5; and see, by the same authors, 
Expert Evidence
 vol 1 (The Law Book Company Limited, Looseleaf Ed, 2001) at ch 11). It is both logical and commonsensical that if the basis or starting-point is either shaky or (worse still) flawed, the conclusion arrived at will be of little or no use to the court. Indeed, if there is in fact something untoward in the starting-point, even the most impeccable reasoning process will be of no avail in so far as the quest for a fair and just result is concerned. This principle is of particular importance with respect to expert reports generally – and especially in the present context of traffic accidents. Unfortunately, however, the general provisions with respect to expert evidence, ss 47 and 48 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), do not furnish us with specific guidance in this particular regard.
69        Both experts in the present case in fact relied upon the available affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) – from 
all
 of the witnesses. They also relied upon the Writ of Summons and the Defence, as well as the respective police reports by the plaintiff and the first defendant. This was the documentary base and constituted, as far as I could see, the main basis for their respective reports.
70        In addition, both experts also visited the accident site to gather evidence and information as well as to produce video clips.
71        I have set out the respective bases for each of the reports. Both reports were in fact similar in approach and even form. Whilst one might, quite legitimately in my view, point to the fact that these were the only “raw materials” available to the respective experts, a moment’s reflection will reveal that the basis in each would, with respect, be far from satisfactory.
72        I have in mind, in particular, the reliance by both experts on the available AEICs.
[28]
 
Whilst the respective AEICs are useful (and indeed efficient) as the points of departure for cross-examination of their respective deponents, they are in fact simply that – material, albeit given under oath, that has to be subjected to testing (often severe testing) on the anvil of cross-examination. In other words, the “raw material” upon which the respective experts in the present case relied was 
itself
 
untested
 at the time it was in fact utilised to produce their respective reports. It should also be borne in mind that this particular category of material constituted an extremely significant part of the basis of the reports themselves. One can immediately see the difficulties that would inevitably arise, especially since such material would 
further
 be, of necessity, 
interpreted
 by the experts themselves as they formulated their respective reports.
73        In all this, I must not be taken to be questioning in one whit the good faith and, indeed, conscientiousness, of the respective experts. I have, in fact, already admitted that the utilisation of the AEICs was inevitable in the circumstances (and compare Hodgkinson ([68] 
supra
) at p 163. However, from an objective perspective, there is much caution that needs to be exercised in interpreting the resulting reports for the reasons I have just set out. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact, as Prof Pinsler very perceptively puts it ([68] 
supra
) at p 554, that:
A balance needs to be struck between too simple an account which omits significant details which the expert needs to consider, and a profusion of facts which will cloud the more important points.
74        Perhaps one 
via media
, as it were, would be for the expert concerned to 
synthesise
, as best he or she can, the factual matrix that can be gleaned from a holistic consideration of the various AEICs as well as the pleadings. Indeed, one might even suggest a minimalist approach inasmuch as the expert would only sift out facts that clearly constituted common ground amongst the various witnesses.
75        However, the approach just proposed is easier said than done. And this is due to practical reasons. For one, the AEICs would emanate from witnesses on either side of the litigation divide. The present case illustrates this point with limpid clarity. Each eyewitness, for instance, took (on most occasions) a polar opposite view of the manner in which the accident took place. This is not surprising as this reflects the diametrically opposed views taken by the plaintiff and the first defendant themselves. How, then, is the expert concerned to produce his or her report? And, to repeat an important question, how much caution must the court exercise with regard to the findings of each report? Cross-examination is one method of alleviating the difficulties but it is by no means even close to perfect as I shall indicate below (at [78]).
76        Also, if each expert adhered solely (or even mainly) to a common core of facts that would clearly be agreed upon between or amongst them, would this common core in effect constitute a hollow core, one that is too dilute to constitute a firm foundation upon which each expert could develop a helpful report?
77        The report by the expert for the plaintiff in this particular case (PW4) demonstrates, in a very practical manner, many of the difficulties canvassed above. For example, in this particular report, PW4 merely sets out extracts from the various AEICs, literally cheek by jowl. There is no attempt to analyse the divergent views expressed therein. This is not surprising. However, this is not very helpful either. It might also be apposite to observe that the various differences do not go away simply because one ignores them. As importantly, apart from an extremely brief 
rebuttal
 of the evidence of two of the defendants’ witnesses (
ie
, DW4 and DW5) there is no real linkage as such between the extracts from the AEICs and the findings and discussion by the expert himself in that part of his report immediately following the setting out of the said extracts themselves. This is not surprising because if the AEICs are themselves in conflict with each other, there would not be a sufficiently “stable” base from which to link the analysis of these AEICs with the findings and discussion by the expert himself. Indeed, the present case merely underscores the difficulties outlined briefly above in a very stark fashion.
78        One method to at least alleviate the various difficulties is to take into account the cross-examination of the various witnesses based on their respective AEICs. However, this would depend on the precise point at which the expert evidence as well as expert reports are adduced. Further, it is by no means clear that the facts would, even after cross-examination, have been “settled” if cross-examination was effected before the expert witness concerned took the witness stand. But that would, then, take us back to “square one”. As Prof Pinsler quite correctly points out ([68] 
supra
) at p 647, “[m]ore often than not, the facts on which experts base their conclusions are in dispute so that if the cross-examiner can show that the facts on which the expert relies are unreliable, his conclusions will not be acceptable” and that “[f]or this purpose it is necessary to determine who observed the facts” (see also above at [72]). It is of course clear that the 
expert
 himself or herself can be cross-examined (
cf
 also Pinsler, 
ibid
). However, we are presently concerned, instead, with the facts with which the expert had prepared his or her report. I also note that it is also open to the court itself to direct, at any stage of the proceedings, a discussion between experts (see O 40A r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed)), although, 
inter alia
, agreement on specific issues is not necessarily binding on the parties unless they expressly agree to be so bound.
79        The various difficulties briefly set out in the preceding paragraphs suggest that the focus ought, where applicable and practical, to be on 
more objective
 (in particular, 
scientific
) criteria. There were aspects of this in the present case itself – for instance, the taking of photographs and video-recordings. However, there are clearly more elaborate methods of accident reconstruction that are particularly suitable in the context of more complex situations than the present and where much higher monetary stakes are involved (including the use of computer-aided accident reconstruction: see, for example, Barry Sullivan, “Computer-Generated Re-Enactments as Evidence in Accident Cases” (1988) 3 High Technology Law Journal 193 and James T Clancy Jr, “Computer Generated Accident Reenactments: The Case for Their Admissibility and Use” (1996) 15 The Review of Litigation 203). This is especially so in the US, where accident reconstruction has even been the focus of at least one novel by a best-selling author (see also the two articles just cited). However, one must of course be careful not to allow such techniques to overwhelm the very valuable (and, I might add, paradoxically inexpensive) resources of plain intellect, logic and common sense. Still more must the spectacular be eschewed if it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Indeed, it is clearly established law that the evidence of an expert is by no means invariably binding on the court (see, for example, 
Sarkar’s Law of Evidence
, vol 1([68] 
supra
) at pp 862–864 and 
Sir John Woodroffe & Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence
, vol 2 ([68] 
supra
) at pp 2324, 2349–2350 and 2363).
80        Nevertheless, parties ought to be open to new and better techniques of reconstruction where the circumstances and resources warrant it. The benefits of accident reconstruction, as it is complemented by a realistic application to the concrete factual matrix itself, are usefully illustrated by a lucid and accessible article already referred to earlier: see Bates & Bates ([63] 
supra
). In this article, the learned authors pertinently conclude thus (at 443):
Accident reconstruction is a valuable tool that can assist attorneys in determining the facts of a case and in presenting those facts in a logical manner.
Attorneys must be expert in the law and its application, but they cannot be expected to have in-depth knowledge of the complicated sciences used to reconstruct an accident. A well-trained accident reconstructionist can provide the scientific input – the determination of the physical factors that clearly define the collision, the cause of injuries to human beings, and all the physical factors involved that possibly led to the accident.
The accident reconstructionist can analyze the pre-accident factors of speed, direction and characteristics of the vehicle, attitude and ability of the driver, condition of the roadway and other environmental factors that are pertinent to the case. Post-accident factors are the location and significance of the final resting place of the vehicles and their parts and passengers, skid marks or other evidence of maneuvering at the time of the accident, and the degree of damage or injury inflicted.
A qualified traffic accident reconstructionist and an attorney can make a winning team.
81        The literature with respect to accident reconstruction is in fact a burgeoning one and repays careful reading. As already alluded to above, despite the actual and potential technicality inherent in specific inquiries and studies, there is a not insignificant amount of literature that not only emanates from a legal perspective but is also remarkably accessible (see, for example, Bates & Bates ([63] 
supra
); Patrick J Robins, 
Eyewitness Reliability in Motor Vehicle Accident Reconstruction and Litigation
 (Lawyers & Judges Publishing Company, Inc, 2001) (albeit from a US perspective); and Ian Freckelton, “What makes an expert? Motor vehicle accident causation and reconstruction evidence” (1996) 70(2) The Law Institute Journal 46; and for an accessible non-legal piece, see George A Peters & Barbara J Peters, 
Automotive Vehicle Safety
 (Taylor & Francis, 2002), ch 11 (entitled “Accident reconstruction”)).
82        There are also 
other
 more general – yet no less intractable – difficulties with regard to expert evidence generally. One has been hinted at, but is in fact an extremely pressing problem and ought therefore to be mentioned. It would surprise no one. It relates to the alleged bias on the part of the expert concerned. It would surprise no one simply because, apart from court-appointed experts, every expert is appointed (and remunerated) by the party who has engaged his or her services. It is true that the expert concerned has, in the final analysis, an overriding duty to objective justice and to the court (see, for example, the oft-cited observations by Lord Wilberforce in the House of Lords decision of 
Whitehouse v Jordan
 
[1981] 1 WLR 246
 at 256–257). The principle just mentioned is now embodied, in the local context, in O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court, as follows:
Expert’s duty to the Court (O. 40A, r. 2)
2.
—(1) It is 
the duty
 of an expert 
to assist the Court
 on the matters within his expertise.
(2)        This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has received instructions or by whom he is paid.
[emphasis added]
Reference may be made, in addition, to O 40A r 3(2)(
h
) as well as the views of V K Rajah JC (as he then was) in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng
 
[2004] 4 SLR 162
 at [79]–[90].
83        All this is only to be expected as “[e]xpert witnesses are in a privileged position; indeed only experts are permitted to give an 
opinion
 in evidence” [emphasis in original] (
per
 Cazalet J in the English decision of 
Re J (Child Abuse: Expert Evidence)
 
[1991] FCR 193
 at 226. To this end, the duties of experts have been set out in detail in many cases. Perhaps one of the most detailed formulations is that by Cresswell J in the English High Court decision of 
The Ikarian Reefer
 [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 68 at 81–82, which was endorsed (with one modification) on appeal: see 
per
 Stuart-Smith LJ, delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in 
The Ikarian Reefer
 [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 455 at 496. Indeed, Cresswell J’s formulation has been described as “[t]he most important enunciation of the duties and responsibilities of expert witnesses” (see Freckelton & Selby, 
The Law of Expert Evidence
 ([68] 
supra
) at p 594).
84        However, one cannot be faulted for taking the views just expressed, with respect to an expert’s duty to the court and to justice, with the proverbial pinch of salt, especially when one views this proposition through the lenses of practical reality. Not surprisingly, therefore, this datum difficulty is almost always referred to in the literature and the case law which it cites (see, for example, Jeffrey Pinsler, “Expert’s Duty to be Truthful in the Light of the Rules of Court” 
(2004) 16 SAcLJ 407
 and, by the same author, 
Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process
 ([68] 
supra
) at p 650; 
Sir John Woodroffe & Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence
, vol 2 ([68] 
supra
), especially at pp 2354–2355; and Anthony Kenny, “The Expert in Court” (1983) 99 LQR 197 at 214). It has also been pointed out that “the Court may be induced to believe the expert who has succeeded in putting forward his views in the most persuasive and plausible manner” (see H A Hammelmann, “Expert Evidence” (1947) 10 MLR 32 at 34). This poses no real difficulty if the expert concerned has, 
in fact
, a persuasive case. However, where he or she does not, the intensity surrounding problems of bias (already undesirable in themselves) is driven home – in spades.
85        The real and effective solution to the difficulties centring on the alleged bias of experts probably lies in the sphere of the extra-legal and this, in itself, reflects, once again, the almost natural intractability that especially characterises the law relating to expert evidence.
86        The second related difficulty also relates more specifically to the expert himself or herself (and see generally 
Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore
 ([66] 
supra
) at para 120.259). And that is the issue of the respective 
qualifications
 of the expert. For example, counsel for the defendants in the present case focused on the fact that PW4 did not have any certificates but was, rather, mentored by what appeared then to be the only accredited accident reconstructionist in Singapore. DW7, on the other hand, is an accredited reconstruction expert (under the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and had approximately two years of working experience. Certificates are of course not imperative (see the oft-cited Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal decision of 
Leong Wing Kong v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 54
 at 59, [15]). Further, given the relative “simplicity” of the facts involved in the present case, I was unable to ascertain whether or not formal accreditation did in fact make a significant difference. What appears clear, however, is that, as with the situation with respect to the 
techniques
 of accident reconstruction, there is much room for the development (in tandem) of methods of upgrading 
the expertise
 of practitioners in this particular field.
87        All the issues canvassed above – and more besides – point to the fact that the area of expert evidence generally is in need of re-examination. Fortunately, none of the issues raised had any impact on the resolution of the present proceedings. This was due, as already mentioned, to the fact that the case was a relatively straightforward one, where the expert evidence proffered was not (unfortunately) particularly helpful (see generally [51]–[54] and [66] above). However, Singapore is not the only jurisdiction where a review might be necessary. Significantly, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission’s Issues Paper entitled 
Expert witnesses
 (IP 25, November 2004) refers (at para 1.2) to the “
world-wide
 reassessment and change relating to the management of court business generally and expert witnesses in particular” [emphasis added].
Conclusion
88        As I have already mentioned, I found, on the one hand, the plaintiff to be a reliable witness of truth. His responses were direct and straightforward and at no time did he seek to evade the questions put to him; neither did he attempt to put a gloss on his responses in order to buttress his case. Indeed, as we have seen and will see, part of his testimony would bear against his case precisely because of his candour (see [12]–[15] above and [90]–[96] below).
89        The first defendant’s evidence, on the other hand, did not square at all well with the central argument he was relying upon – which was that the traffic lights were green in his favour but that the dog and the plaintiff had suddenly rushed off the pedestrian kerb and into the path of his vehicle. If so, then it is clear that the plaintiff had, other things being equal, the right of way (see r 7 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules (Cap 276, R 24, 1990 Rev Ed)). It would be equally clear that the first defendant had not kept a proper lookout and/or proceeded at the proper speed as required under the law (see r 5 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules as well as the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of 
Ng Weng Cheong v Soh Oh Loo
 
[1993] 2 SLR 336
 at 341–342, [26]–[29]; interestingly, this case was also cited in the defendants’ bundle of authorities but was clearly distinguishable in so far as the material facts between that case and this are concerned). Reference may also generally be made, in this regard, to rr 77 to 80 of the Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed). In this last-mentioned regard, the following observations by V K Rajah JC (as he then was) in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Cheong Ghim Fah v Murugian s/o Rangasamy
 
[2004] 1 SLR 628
 at [58]–[60] are apposite (especially since they deal with the very germane issue of the applicability as well as application of the Highway Code (“HC”) to the 
Singapore
 context):
The HC in Singapore has been promulgated to apprise all road users of standards that they ought to observe when they use our roads. It does not impose arbitrary or unrealistic standards, to be heeded only when convenient. The HC is an important statement of practice, usage and responsibility that ought to be respected by all road users, save in limited exigencies. Failure to observe the HC can be perilous to other road users.
It must be emphasised that the HC itself states that while it is not a digest of traffic laws, it is a code of conduct and furthermore stresses the 
responsibilities of road users to each other
: r 1. As r 3 of the HC pithily sums it up, “Road traffic requires the co-operation of all road users for its smooth and efficient operation”. Road users in Singapore, whether they are motorists, motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians or joggers, must understand that while they all have natural rights to use our roads, these rights carry responsibilities.
For these reasons, the fact that a road user has ignored or failed to comply with the provisions of the HC should never be lightly dismissed. The consequences of a breach will be dependent, in my view, on a confluence of interplaying factors that ought to include:
(a)        the particular provision of the HC breached;
(b)        the circumstances in which the breach took place;
(c)        whether the breach was conscious or inadvertently took place because of certain exigencies.
[emphasis in original]
90        However, notwithstanding the fact that the balance hitherto lies in favour of the plaintiff, I find that the plaintiff was himself guilty of contributory negligence.
91        The operative provision is, of course, s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) which reads as follows:
Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the 
responsibility
 for the damage. [emphasis added]
92        Returning to the present case, even though I believe that the traffic lights were in the plaintiff’s favour, the plaintiff ought nevertheless to have checked to see that it was safe to cross the lane immediately in front of him. As we have seen, he checked the 
other
 two lanes. This would ordinarily have been an adequate indication that the lights were in his (the plaintiff’s) favour and that it was safe to cross. However, because of the first defendant’s negligence, this was not a wholly sufficient course of action on the part of the plaintiff in the circumstances. And it was certainly not a risk which a reasonably prudent person in the plaintiff’s position would have taken, although, in the circumstances, it was clear that the defendant was still substantially responsible for the accident and that the plaintiff was not wholly careless. As Rajah JC succinctly put it in 
Cheong Ghim Fah v Murugian s/o Rangasamy
 ([89] 
supra
) at [83]:
A person may be guilty of contributory negligence if he ought to have objectively foreseen that his failure to act prudently could result in hurting himself.
93        And, in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Lewis v Denye
 
[1939] 1 KB 540
, du Parcq LJ observed thus (at 554–555):
In order to establish the defence of contributory negligence, the defendant must prove, first, that the plaintiff failed to take “ordinary care for himself,” or, in other words, such care as a reasonable man would take for his own safety, and, secondly, that his failure to take care was a contributory cause of the accident. The doctrine of contributory negligence “cannot be based upon a breach of duty to the negligent defendant.”
94        Indeed, it is extremely important to note that the focus is on the 
plaintiff
 
and
 there is 
no
 need to demonstrate that the plaintiff had been in breach of a 
legal
 duty of care as such. In the oft-cited words of Denning LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ld
 
[1949] 2 KB 291
 at 324–325 (and which are particularly apposite, having regard to the facts of the present proceedings):
When a man steps into the road he owes a duty to himself to take care for his own safety
, but he does not owe any duty to a motorist who is going at an excessive speed to avoid being run down. 
Nevertheless, if he does not keep a good lookout, he is guilty of contributory negligence
. The real question is not whether the plaintiff was neglecting some legal duty, but whether he was acting as a reasonable man and with reasonable care. [emphasis added]
95        And in 
Cheong Ghim Fah v Murugian s/o Rangasamy
 ([89] 
supra
), Rajah JC observed thus in so far as the actual apportionment of liability is concerned (at [87]):
Apportionment is more an exercise in discretion than in clinical science; it is one that involves imponderables. Mathematics does not come into the picture given that the court exercises a general discretion, taking into account the causative potency as well as the blameworthiness to be assigned to the different parties involved. Section 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed), by dint of the operative word “responsibility”, requires a focus on the responsible causes of an accident.
96        It should, for example, be noted that the material facts in the present case are quite different from that which obtained, for example, in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Ang Kuang Hoe v Chia Chor Yew
 
[2004] 1 SLR 696
, where the plaintiff pedestrian in fact crossed the road at an unmarked spot when the pedestrian crossing at the traffic lights was nearby. Not surprisingly, therefore, the apportionment of liability in that particular case would be quite different from that in the present case.
97        In the circumstances, while I find that the first defendant was substantially to blame for the accident, I determine, in the light of all the material circumstances of the case, that liability is to be apportioned in the proportion of 80% to 20% in favour of the plaintiff. The same result obtains with regard to the second defendant.
98        In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff on liability in the proportion mentioned above, with costs to be taxed or agreed. Damages are to be assessed by the Registrar.
99        In so far as ancillary matters are concerned, I made no order as to costs with regard to Summons in Chambers Nos 733 of 2005 and 826 of 2005. The costs for Originating Summons No 1329 of 2004 are to be determined by the Registrar after the actual quantum of damages has been assessed.
Judgment for the plaintiff.

District Judge Toh Yung Cheong
1.         The accused claimed trial to four charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224). The first charge states:
“You, Ng Lian Wah, m/38 years, are charged that you, on or about 7 January 2003, in Singapore, did engage with Lee Chew Seng and Saw Chee Keang in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, one Chung Foong Yee of Startech Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Startech”) prepared a fictitious Unison Distribution Services Invoice No. 03/0001 for $255,488.80 dated 7 January 2003, purportedly being the purchase of electronic components by the said Startech, which [was] subsequently submitted by Startech to support the financing application from Malayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”) which invoice dishonestly induced Maybank to process and approve the said application and to deliver $255,488.80 to Unison Distribution Services and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 109 read with section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”
2.         The three remaining charges were similar and involved amounts of $252,213.20, $303,207.13 and $100,586.00 respectively. At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on all the charges. As he has appealed against his conviction and sentence, I now give the reasons for my decision.
Outline
3.         This is a case involving the use of false invoices and delivery orders to support trade financing applications to banks. As the defence did not dispute that false documents were used, the main issue in this case was the accused’s knowledge of the scheme.
Agreed Facts
4.         The prosecution and the defence agreed to the admission of an agreed statement of facts (Exhibit A) which sets out the undisputed background facts to this case.
5.         The accused, Ng Lian Wah, registered a business by the name of Unison Distribution Services (“Unison”) on 13 September 2002.
6.         Startech Electronics Limited (“SEL”) is a SESDAQ listed company and more than 80% of its revenue is from providing contract-manufacturing services to the electronics industry through its wholly-owned subsidiary Startech Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“SMPL”).
7.         Saw Chee Keang (“Saw”) was SMPL’s Executive Director from 1994 to 2003. As SMPL’s Executive Director, Saw was one of the signatories of SMPL’s bank account and its signatory on its credit facility applications to Malayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”) and DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”).
8.         On 28 March 2002, Saw accepted, on behalf of SMPL, a Letter of Offer from Maybank for $13.2 million in credit facilities including $8 million in trade credit financing through trust receipts. These credit facilities were renewed on 10 March 2003. On 5 September 2002, Saw obtained a credit facility with DBS which included a $1 million trade financing facility for SMPL.
Trade Financing Application Procedures
9.         In order for Maybank to process and approve the trade financing application, SMPL had to submit a Trust Receipt Financing Application Form with the supplier’s invoice attached. This invoice would represent that goods were supplied by the supplier to the customer. The delivery order from the supplier was not needed but the customer had to declare and confirm that the documents submitted were “authentic and genuine.”
10.       As a matter of procedure, Maybank’s officers did not call up the supplier to check whether the invoices and delivery orders were indeed authentic and genuine. As part of the procedure, the only documents which Maybank’s officers relied upon during the approval process were the Trust Receipt Financing Application Form and the supplier’s invoice. After the application was approved, Maybank would credit the supplier’s bank account.
11.       Between 2 April 2002 and 23 May 2003, SMPL submitted to Maybank a total of 118 Trust Receipt Applications of which two were supported by invoices and delivery orders which bore Unison’s name. Based on these documents, Maybank processed and approved the trust receipt applications on the basis that SMPL had declared that it had purchased goods from the supplier as stated in the invoices and delivery orders.
12.       Where DBS was concerned, SMPL had to submit a Bills Receivable / Purchase Financing Application Form (“BRPF”) attached with the supplier’s invoice and the delivery order. The application was made on the basis that the transactions stated in the supporting supplier’s invoice and delivery order were genuine and that goods had been delivered by the supplier to the customer.
13.       As a matter of procedure, DBS’ officers did not call up the suppliers to check whether the invoices and delivery orders were authentic and genuine. The only documents which DBS’ officers relied on were the BRPF application form and the supplier’s invoice and delivery order. After the application was approved, DBS would credit the supplier’s bank account.
14.       Between 13 January and 11 February 2003, SMPL submitted to DBS a total of 11 BRPF Applications, two of which were supported by invoices and delivery orders bearing Unison’s name. Based on these documents, DBS processed and approved the BRPF applications on the basis that SMPL had declared that it had purchased goods from the supplier as stated on the application forms, invoices and delivery orders.

Prosecution’s Case
Evidence of PW1 Stephanie Chung Foong Yee (“Stephanie”)
22.       Stephanie Chung Foong Yee gave evidence orally and by way of a conditioned statement (exhibit PS1). Stephanie was the secretary of Saw Chee Keang, the Chief Executive Officer of Startech Electronics Limited (“SEL”) and the Managing Director of Startech Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“SMPL”).
23.       Since the late 1990s, Stephanie had been instructed by Saw to prepare trade financing applications based on fictitious invoices and delivery orders. These invoices and delivery order represented that goods were supplied and delivered by the suppliers to SMPL and Stephanie admitted that she was aware there were in fact no goods supplied or delivered. The banks would then credit the money reflected in the invoices into the suppliers’ bank accounts. The suppliers would return a commission of about 0.3% of the amount in the invoice and return the rest to SMPL.
24.       Stephanie explained that they used trade financing to tide over SMPL’s financial difficulties. SMPL had many term loans to pay, hire purchase payments to make, and the workers needed to be paid. In addition, genuine customers would often not pay on time.
25.       One of the suppliers involved in the scheme was Alvin Wong Siow Hiong (“Alvin”), the sole proprietor of Dara Services and K2 Tech Components. Sometime at the end of 2002, Alvin informed Stephanie that his bank had queried him about the monies that were going into the moving immediately out of his bank account. Due to these queries, Stephanie mentioned to Saw and Stan Lee Chew Seng (“Stan”) that the bank had asked why they were only using one supplier for the trust receipt financing applications. Stan told her that he would try to get his friend to do the trade financing.
26.       A few days later, Stan informed her that he managed to get his friend Lawrence, the accused, to do the trade financing. Stephanie told Stan she needed the letterheads of his friend’s company to prepare the invoices and delivery orders and also needed the company’s stamp. A few days later, Stan gave her a few letterheads of the accused’s company Unison Distribution Services (“Unison”). Thereafter, Stan gave her Unison’s company stamp.
27.       Sometime in January 2003, Saw instructed her to apply for trade financing using Unison as the supplier. Stephanie prepared an invoice and delivery order for electronic components using Unison’s letterhead. After that she filled in a Maybank trust receipt application form and obtained from Stan the particulars of Unison’s bank account. Thereafter, she handed the invoice, delivery order and trust receipt application form to Stan. The trust receipt application form was meant for Stan to sign as an authorised signatory.
28.       Subsequently, Stan returned to Stephanie all the documents which had been signed. Stephanie then submitted them to Maybank. About two days after she submitted the trust receipt application, she asked Stan to check with Lawrence whether the money had been credited to the accused’s account by Maybank. Stan later informed Stephanie that the money had been credited. Stephanie then told Stan that she needed the accused’s cheque. Later on the same day, Stan handed over at least one pre-signed blank cheque from Unison’s bank account. Stephanie then worked out the amount that Unison was to return to SMPL, filled in the cheque and banked the cheque into SMPL’s bank account.
29.       In addition to this application, Stephanie had submitted three other trade financing applications to either Maybank or DBS using supporting invoices and delivery orders from Unison.
30.       The second trade financing application was dated 13 January 2003 and was made to DBS. It was not signed by Stan but by two other authorised signatories. Stephanie gave to Stan the invoice and delivery order of Unison which she prepared so that he could get Lawrence to sign them. Later that day or the next day, Stan returned the invoice and delivery order which had been signed. The amount involved was $303,207.13 Thereafter, she filled in the pre-signed Unison cheque for an amount that represented about 99.7% of the amount credited into Unison’s bank account and banked the cheque into SEL’s bank account.
31.       The third and fourth trade financing applications were dated 11 February and 13 February 2003 and were made to Maybank. Both applications for the trade financing were signed by Stan. Stephanie gave to Stan on two separate occasions the invoice and delivery order of Unison so that he could get Lawrence to sign them. On one occasion, Stan signed the invoice and delivery order there and then for Unison and returned it to her. For the other occasion, Stan returned the invoice and delivery order with the signatures of the Unison representative either later in the day or the next morning.
32.       The 11 February 2003 application was for the sum of $100,586. Stephanie filled in the pre-signed cheque with an amount that represented 99.7% of this amount and told Stan to withdraw this amount in cash and thereafter bank the cash into SMPL’s account. The 13 February 2003 application was for the sum of $252,213.20. Stephanie similarly filled in a pre-signed cheque for 99.7% of this amount and banked the cheque into SMPL’s bank account.
33.       After the 99.7% of the money was returned to SMPL or SEL, Stephanie prepared a debit note for Stan to sign. The purpose of the debit note for each transaction was to show that SMPL was rejecting the bulk of the goods that were supposedly supplied by Unison in order to justify the money that was returned by Unison to SMPL or SEL. Stephanie testified that she was not able to find these debit notes and the prosecution indicated that they were not in possession of them.
34.       At the end of January 2003, Stephanie gave to Stan the original debit note and purchase order, a copy of the invoice and a copy of the delivery order for the 7 and 13 January 2003 trade financing applications for him to give to the accused for his records.
35.       Similarly, at the end of February 2003, Stephanie gave Stan the original debit note and purchase order, a copy of the invoice and a copy of the delivery order for the 11 and 13 February 2003 trade financing applications for him to give to the accused for his records.
36.       During cross-examination, Stephanie admitted that she did not have direct contact with the accused and that it was Stan who dealt with the accused
[1]
. In contrast, for the trade financing involving K2 and Dara, Stephanie would communicate directly with Alvin Wong, the sole proprietor of those businesses. For the trade financing applications involving Alvin Wong, sometimes Alvin Wong would sign the invoices and delivery orders and sometimes Stephanie would sign and inform Alvin Wong about it
[2]
.
37.       Though Stephanie handed to Stan documents which he was supposed to hand over to the accused, she was not in a position to say whether Stan actually handed them over to the accused.
38.       According to Stephanie, Stan handed to her hard copies of the Unison letterhead that he had printed out from his computer. When asked why he did not simply give her a soft copy, Stephanie replied that he did not want to keep the letterheads.
39.       During cross-examination, Stephanie stated that she signed the acknowledgement column of the purchase order and delivery order for the transactions involving Unison and denied signing any of Unison’s invoices and denied signing on behalf of Unison
[3]
.
40.       PW2 Stan Lee subsequently gave evidence that on one occasion, Stephanie handed to him two invoices and one delivery order. This was different from Stephanie’s evidence as she testified that she would only give Stan one set of documents at a time. The defence applied to recall Stephanie to question her on Stan’s assertion that she gave him two invoices on one occasion. As this evidence touched on a material aspect of the case, I allowed the recall of the witness.
41.       After Stephanie was recalled to give evidence, she stated that she would not be able to submit to the bank two applications at one time since they had different dates. As such, she would not have prepared the two invoices together unless Mr Saw gave her the instruction to prepare the documents earlier.  When Counsel questioned her whether on this occasion, she had in fact prepared two sets, she stated that she could not recall
[4]
.
Evidence of PW2 Stan Lee Chew Seng
42.       Stan Lee Chew Seng (“Stan”) was a director of SMPL at the material time. He is serving a 51 month sentence for his role in a conspiracy to cheat banks by using trade financing facilities. Stan has known the accused since 1994 or 1995 when he was a manpower supplier. The accused at that time was supplying foreign workers from China to SMPL’s factory in Woodlands.
43.       In relation to the trade financing applications, Stan was aware of the scheme whereby fictitious invoices and delivery orders were submitted to banks for the purpose of obtaining trade financing.  After the money was credited into the supplier’s accounts, it would be transferred back into SMPL’s account. SMPL resorted to this as the company was not doing well at that time.
44.       The bulk of the trade financing applications using fictitious documents involved Dara Services and K2 Tech Components which Alvin Wong was in charge of.
45.       Sometime in September 2002, Stan was approached by Mr Saw and informed that he had started some trading business in China. He told Stan that he faced some difficulties in getting the parts and components in China and the main reason was because of tax issues and payment to the suppliers in China. In respect of the tax issue, Stan explained that if a China-based company issued an invoice, they had to pay a tax of 17% which is very high. Saw wanted to avoid paying tax from the invoice by using a local Singapore company to order goods. Saw requested him to find a local Singapore company to act as a sourcing agent to buy parts and at the same time make payment to suppliers in China.
46.       Stan agreed and approached the accused as he had contacts in China. Stan met up with the accused and explained to him that they needed an agent in Singapore to source for parts and at the same time make payment to China companies. SMPL would prepare the necessary documents on what parts to buy and present it to the accused and that Saw would arrange for the people to be paid in China. Stan also informed him that payment was to be made by cash or telegraphic transfer and that the accused had to arrange for someone in China to pay the suppliers.
47.       Stan also told the accused that he would be getting the money by submitting the invoice to the bank for trade financing
[5]
. The banks would credit the money to his company and the accused was to arrange payment out. There was however no discussion how the payments out would be made.
48.       The accused also told Stan that he wanted to control the cheques and wanted to know who was going to bank in the cheques. According to Stan, the accused registered a company and provided Stan with the details of the company. The name of the company was Unison Distribution Services.
49.       After the company was set up, Stan also asked the accused for the company stamp of Unison and subsequently the accused passed him the stamp and Stan passed it to Stephanie. According to Stan, Stephanie required the company stamp in order to prepare the invoice. Stephanie also asked Stan for Unison’s letterheads and cheques. Stan created a letterhead in the computer and passed her the soft copy. He also obtained about four to five pre-signed blank cheques from the accused.
50.       On 7 January 2003, Stephanie gave Stan three documents: two invoices dated 7 and 13 January respectively and one delivery order dated 7 January 2003. Stan identified these documents as P12, P13 and P16 respectively. Stephanie told Stan to get these documents signed and Stan brought the documents to the accused.
51.       After handing the documents to the accused, Stan told him that the documents specify the components that the accused needed to purchase. Stan also told the accused that he (i.e. Stan) needed to submit the invoice and delivery order to the bank. The accused signed the three documents and Stan took them back and gave them to Stephanie. During re-examination, Stan clarified that he explained to the accused that the documents reflect the parts that the accused needs to purchase and sell in China and the reason why the invoice and delivery order was put up in advance was in order to buy parts and to pay the supplier in China
[6]
 
However, Stan did not provide the accused was any other information on what parts to buy.
52.       In respect of this transaction, Stephanie subsequently asked Stan to check with the accused whether the money had been credited to the account
[7]
.  Stan called the accused and the latter said that he would check with the bank. Later, the accused called and informed Stan that the money had been credited to his account.
53.       Thereafter, Stan went to China and after the end of January 2003, he returned to Singapore. Stephanie gave him an invoice and delivery order with Unison’s letterhead. Stan was remorseful as he realised that the first two documents the accused had signed were not actual transactions. As he did not want to involve the accused with the scam, he signed the documents himself.
54.       Similarly, for subsequent transactions involving the use of Unison’s invoice and delivery order, Stan testified that he signed the documents himself and did not ask the accused to sign them. In total, there were a total of four trade financing applications involving Unison.
55.       Stephanie also gave Stan a stack of documents in a folder and asked him to pass them to the accused for filing. Stan took the folder and passed it to Lawrence but he did not check what was inside the folder
[8]
. According to Stan, he gave the accused the invoices and delivery orders before police investigations had begun
[9]
.
56.       After these four transactions and after he passed the folder to the accused, Stan did not meet with the accused regarding these transactions until a few months later when he told the accused that there was no more business for Unison anymore. The accused acknowledged this
[10]
.
Cross Examination
57.       Stan admitted during cross-examination to knowing the accused since the early 1990s. At one point, Stan and the accused had agreed to become monks together
[11]
 
and they were good friends.
58.       During cross-examination, Stan testified that when he approached the accused with his proposal, he believed that it was a legitimate and bona fide business transaction at that point in time. Stan claimed that he had been deceived by Saw and only realised this during the third transaction when he encashed the cash cheque
[12]
. By this time, the accused was not involved in the transactions. Stan also testified that the accused was not involved in the conspiracy to cheat the banks.
59.       When Stan was re-examined, he agreed that on the face of it, the invoice and delivery order represented that Unison Distribution Services had sold or supplied goods to Startech when this was not the case.
Evidence of PW3 CAO Chua Jia Leng
60.       Commercial Affairs Officer Chua Jia Leng (“CAO Chua”) is the investigating officer of this case. In the course of her investigations, she obtained copies of Unison’s Bank statements (exhibit P31).
61.       On 22 October 2003, CAO Chua went to the accused’s office in order to obtain documents relevant to investigations that were being carried out at that time. When CAO Chua produced a written order under s.58 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the accused handed to CAO Chua a yellow paper folder containing certain documents.
62.       The documents found in the yellow paper folder were four sets of purchase orders, delivery orders and invoices with the letterheads of Unison and SMPL. According to CAO Chua, these documents were:
a)         P27 Purchase order dated 7 January 2003
b)         P28 Purchase order dated 10 January 2003
c)         P29 Purchase order dated 10 February 2003
d)         P30 Purchase order dated 11 February 2003
e)         P34 Unison invoice dated 7 January 2003
f)          P35 Unison delivery order dated 7 January 2003
g)         P36 Unison invoice dated 13 January 2003
h)         P37 Unison delivery order dated 13 January 2003
i)          P38 Unison invoice dated 11 February 2003
j)          P39 Unison delivery order dated 11 February 2003
k)         P40 Unison invoice dated 13 February 2003
l)          P41 Unison delivery order dated 13 February 2003
63.       In respect of the invoices and delivery orders seized from the accused (exhibits P34 to P41), they were basically the same documents as the ones obtained from the banks by the prosecution. The main difference was that the documents obtained from the banks have the bank chop which would have been applied only after the documents were submitted to the bank. In addition, there were some annotations subsequently added by the investigators such as document serial numbers.
Close of the prosecution’s case
64.       At the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence made a submission of no case to answer. Essentially, Counsel’s submission was that the evidence of PW2 Stan Lee was inherently incredible in view of the inconsistency with Stephanie’s evidence over whether one or two invoices were prepared for the accused to sign. In addition, Counsel pointed to Stan’s claim that the accused did not know the true details of the transaction.
65.       In reply, the prosecution pointed out that based on Stan’s evidence, the accused had signed invoices and delivery orders knowing that no goods were delivered from Unison to Startech. The accused had also given his company stamp and pre-signed blank cheques to Stan and had also retained a sum of money after each transaction. As such, there was an inference that the accused was involved in the conspiracy to cheat the banks.
66.       In considering the submissions of the defence, I was mindful of the principles enunciated in the case of 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 and reiterated in 
Ng Theng Shuang v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
.
 I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that at this stage, there was at the very least, a reasonable inference that the accused was involved in a conspiracy to cheat banks by applying for trade financing using false documents with the Unison letterhead. Accordingly, I called upon the accused to enter his defence
Defence
67.       The accused elected to remain silent. The only defence witness was Stan’s wife, Mdm Ooi Pek Yen.
Evidence of DW1 Ooi Pek Yen (“Mdm Ooi”)
68.       Mdm Ooi is the wife of Stan Lee. She confirmed that Stan resigned from Startech in 2003 but at that time she did not know the reason why he resigned but knew that Stan was being investigated by the police.
69.       After Stan resigned, Mdm Ooi claimed that Stephanie called their home two to three times a day over a period of a few weeks
[13]
. She was aware of these calls as sometimes she would answer the phone.
70.       On one occasion, Mdm Ooi spoke to Stephanie and Stephanie offered to take care of her second child. This was before there was any mention of Stan taking the blame.
71.       On two or three occasions, Stan told Mdm Ooi that Stephanie wanted Stan to take the blame for her
[14]
 
though Mdm Ooi confirmed that Stephanie never mentioned this to her directly. However, Stephanie had heard Stan telling Stephanie over the phone that she was just a secretary and was “not implicated too much” in the matter
[15]
.
72.       On another occasion, Stephanie called and said that she was raising money for Mr Saw. Mdm Ooi also testified that Stan mentioned the accused to her and Stan told her that the accused was innocent.
73.       Unlike his wife, Stan’s recollection of these alleged conversations was poor. When Stan was asked about these alleged conversations, Stan replied that he could not remember them.
Outline of the key issues at the close of the trial
74.       The key issues which I had to consider at the close of the trial were:
a)         Whether Stan’s evidence was credible in view of the inconsistencies between his evidence and Stephanie’s evidence.
b)         Even if Stan’s evidence was accepted, whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the drawing of an inference that the accused was part of the conspiracy.
My Decision
General approach to the assessment of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
75.       Stephanie Chung and Stan Lee had knowledge that the invoice and delivery order were not genuine as Unison had not sold any goods to SMPL. Furthermore, both of them knew (with Stan claiming he knew only after the third transaction) that these documents were used to support trade financing applications to the banks which resulted in the bank crediting Unison’s bank account. Therefore, they should be considered as accomplices.
76.       Section 135 of the Evidence Act makes it clear that a court may convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to section 116 of the Act states that the court may presume an accomplice to be unworthy of credit. In 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
, the High Court explained the effect of these provisions:
“The combined effect of s 135 and illustration (b) to s 116 is that the court may convict an accused based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should still treat such evidence with caution as the accomplice may be presumed to be unworthy of credit There is thus no requirement for any corroboration warning, but the evidence of an accomplice may, and indeed, generally would, be treated with caution.”
77.       With this in mind, I scrutinised the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
Assessment of the evidence of PW1 Stephanie Chung
78.       Stephanie had not been charged in connection with the present offences though she was certainly involved in the offences. As such, I bore in mind the possibility that Stephanie might wish to downplay her role and push the blame to the accused.
79.       However, after going through her evidence, I found her to be a candid and forthright witness. She admitted that she was the person who prepared the documents used for the trade financing applications while knowing full well that the documents were not genuine as no goods had been sold by Unison.
80.       Stephanie testified that she did not have any direct dealings with the accused and that she dealt with Stan. When she told Stan to pass documents to the accused, she relied on Stan to do so and she admitted frankly that she did not know whether Stan actually passed the documents to the accused. By testifying that she handed the documents to Stan to pass to the accused, I found that she was simply describing in a matter-of-fact manner a procedure she had consistently adopted and in no way did she downplay her own role in this matter.
81.       In respect of one of the four transactions, Stephanie also admitted that Stan had signed the invoice and delivery order in front of her and returned it to her thereafter. This was evidence favourable to the accused as it suggested that he did not have sight of those documents.
82.       Accordingly, I accepted her evidence concerning the invoices and delivery orders which she handed over to Stan for Stan to get Unison’s signature and I accepted her evidence that she asked Stan to check with the accused whether the funds had been credited after each transaction had taken place. I will deal in detail with the discrepancies between her evidence and Stan’s evidence subsequently.
Assessment of the evidence of PW2 Stan Lee
83.       As for Stan Lee, he had been charged for offences connected to his role in the trade financing scam involving not only Unison but other businesses such as K2 and Dara. He had since pleaded guilty and was serving a sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, there was little reason or incentive for him to implicate the accused in order to downplay his role in this affair.
84.       From his evidence in court, it was clear that Stan was clearly not out to incriminate the accused. Stan admitted that he was a close friend of the accused. From the start, in his examination-in-chief, Stan claimed that the accused knew nothing about the trade financing scam that actually took place. During cross-examination, he claimed that when he approached the accused, he believed that the transaction was a legitimate and bona fide one. Stan also agreed repeatedly with Counsel’s suggestions that the accused knew nothing about the scam.
85.       Stan was also able to recount in detail his conversations with the accused and his evidence was internally consistent. In addition, the defence did not contradict Stan or put to him that he was either lying or mistaken in respect of his evidence concerning:
a)         The conversation between him and the accused which led to the accused agreeing to allow Unison’s bank account to be used by SMPL.
b)         His evidence that the accused signed the documents that Stan handed to him.
c)         His evidence that he handed to the accused copies of the invoices and delivery orders before police investigations had begun.
86.       In the circumstances, I was of the view that I could rely on Stan’s evidence concerning the extent of the accused’s involvement and the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the scheme.
The discrepancies in PW1 and PW2’s evidence considered
87.       There were a few discrepancies when the evidence of Stephanie was compared to Stan’s evidence. The first discrepancy concerned the letterhead of Unison. According to Stan, he prepared a soft copy of the letterhead using the computer and gave the soft copy to Stephanie. According to Stephanie, she received a hard copy from Stan. I was of the view that this was a minor inconsistency attributable to a genuine error of recollection and had little impact on the prosecution’s case.
88.       The next discrepancy related to the very first trade financing application. According to Stephanie, she handed to Stan one invoice and delivery order and asked him to give it to the accused for his signature.  As for Stan, he claimed that on 7 January 2003, Stephanie gave him two invoices and one delivery order for the accused to sign. According to Stan, the two invoices were dated 7 and 13 January respectively.
89.       In light of this discrepancy, I allowed the defence to recall Stephanie as a witness in order to question her on this. Stephanie maintained that there was only one invoice dated 7 January and there was no point in creating a post dated invoice dated 13 January since it could not be submitted. However, she conceded that if Saw had asked her to prepare an invoice in advance, she would do so.
90.       When deciding on the effect that this discrepancy had on the credibility of both witnesses, I had regard to the observations made by Abdul Hamid J in 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
:
Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate need do is to consider the discrepancies. … On the other hand, if the magistrate finds that the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would then be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them. On the other hand, if the magistrate finds that the discrepancies relate to a material point which would seriously affect the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses then it would be his duty to weigh the evidence carefully in arriving at the truth.
91.       The alleged incident in this case took place more than two years ago in January 2003. In addition, both witnesses appear to have been involved in numerous trade financing applications of this type. In the circumstances, it is entirely possible that the discrepancy arose because of an error in recollection.
92.       Even if there was an error in recollection by either witness, I found that that this did not affect Stan’s evidence that he did in fact give the accused at least one invoice and one delivery order for his signature on or about 7 January 2003. Such a fact was less susceptible to an error in recollection for the following reasons:
a)         Stan was able to point to a major event, namely his trip to China in late January 2003 as a reference in determining when these events took place.
b)         Stan claimed that he later made a conscious decision not to involve the accused in the matter by signing the invoice and delivery orders himself. This supported his evidence that initially, he had involved the accused by getting him to sign the invoice and delivery order on or about 7 January 2003.
c)         Stan had an opportunity to look at the invoices and delivery orders and should be able to tell which documents he signed and which he did not.
Assessment of the evidence of DW1 Ooi Pek Yen
93        Even if I accepted the evidence of Mdm Ooi in its entirety, I found her evidence to be of little assistance to this case. Even if Stephanie had initially asked Stan to shoulder the blame, I was still of the view that for the reasons I have stated earlier, Stephanie was a credible witness in court.  A careful review of Stephanie’s evidence in court did not show her to be pushing the blame to Stan. In fact, apart from the minor discrepancies I highlighted earlier, Stan’s evidence was by and large consistent with that of Stephanie’s.
Defence submissions of adverse inference against the prosecution
94.       The defence submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had signed any invoice or delivery order. When cross-examining the investigating officer CAO Chua, the defence dwelled extensively on her failure to send the documents to a handwriting analysis. Since CAO Chua failed to send the documents for a handwriting analysis, the defence urged the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution pursuant to section 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act.
[16]
95.       In the present case, CAO Chua testified that she took over as investigating officer in June 2004. She did not order a handwriting analysis in this case as she did not consider it material.
[17]
96.       In 
Osman bin Din v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 129
, the offender was charged with trafficking in a controlled drug. The defence made a similar argument in respect of the Central Narcotics Bureau’s failure to conduct a fingerprint analysis on the bag of drugs that was seized from the offender. The Court of Appeal observed that there was no primary or statutory obligation on the part of the authorities to undertake a fingerprint examination and in any event, there was sufficient evidence to show that the offender was in possession of the drugs. The Court of Appeal also held that on reviewing the evidence, they were satisfied that there was no evidence of impropriety on the part of the prosecution or the investigating officer to suppress any evidence which might support the appellant’s case.
97.       There was no primary or statutory obligation on the part of the police to conduct a handwriting analysis of the signatures on the documents. I also failed to see in what way the police were withholding evidence since the invoices and delivery orders were produced in court and there was no handwriting analysis performed in the first place.  In my view, the real issue is whether the prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence to prove that the accused had signed the invoice and delivery order in question. As such, I declined to draw an adverse inference in this case.
Cheating
98.       It was not disputed that offences of cheating were carried out. The Unison invoices and delivery orders were not genuine as Unison had not sold any goods to SMPL. These documents were used to support trade financing applications to DBS and Maybank. As a result, the banks transferred large sums of money to Unison’s account, something they would not have done had they realised that the supporting documents were not genuine.
Abetment by conspiracy
99.       At this stage, it would be useful to set out the law on abetment by conspiracy. Section 107(b) of the Penal Code provides that a person abets the doing of a thing if he:
Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing.
100.     In 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 at para 58, the Court of Appeal outlined the essential ingredients of the offence of abetment by conspiracy:
Unlike criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy. (See also explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code.) According to Koh Clarkson and Morgan’s Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia (1989) at pp 311–312, the essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are: first, the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.
101.     As for the knowledge and intention that the accused must possess before he can be found guilty of the offence, I referred to the case of 
Nomura Taiji and others v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 173
 where the learned Chief Justice reviewed the existing authorities and summarised the applicable principles. In particular, His Honour referred to the case of 
Johnson v Youden & Ors
 
[1950] 1 KB 544
 where Lord Goddard CJ stated:
Before a person can be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence he must at least know the essential matters which constitute that offence. He need not actually know that an offence has been committed, because he may not know that the facts constitute an offence and ignorance of the law is not a defence. If a person knows all the facts and is assisting another person to do certain things, and it turns out that the doing of those things constitutes an offence, the person who is assisting is guilty of aiding and abetting that offence, because to allow him to say, ‘I knew of all those facts but I did not know that an offence was committed,’ would be allowing him to set up ignorance of the law as a defence.
102.     In 
Churchill v Walton
 [1967] 1 All ER 497, Viscount Dilhorne in the House of Lords cited the above passage in 
Johnson v Youden & Ors
 with approval and stated:
I would say that mens rea is only an essential ingredient in conspiracy insofar as there must be an intention to be a party to an agreement to do an unlawful act; that knowledge of the law on the part of the accused is immaterial, and that knowledge of the facts is only material insofar as such knowledge throws a light on what was agreed. In cases of this kind, it is desirable to avoid the use of the phrase ‘mens rea’, which is capable of different meanings, and to concentrate on the terms or effect of the agreement made by the alleged conspirators. The question is ‘What did they agree to do?’ If what they agreed to do was, on the facts known to them, an unlawful act, they are guilty of conspiracy and cannot excuse themselves by saying that, owing to their ignorance of the law, they did not realise that such an act was a crime. If, on the facts known to them, what they agreed to do was lawful, they are not rendered artificially guilty by the existence of other facts, not known to them, giving a different and criminal quality to the act agreed on.
Summary of the pertinent evidence
103.     According to Stan, he informed the accused that:
a)         Stan needed an agent in Singapore to source of parts and at the same time make payment to companies in China
b)         The accused would be getting the money by submitting invoices to the bank for trade financing.
c)         The bank would transfer the money to the accused’s bank account and the accused was to arrange for payment out.
104.     In addition, Stan testified that the accused agreed to the above proposal and thereafter the following took place:
a)         Stan handed to the accused at least two documents: an invoice dated 7 January 2003 and a delivery order dated 7 January 2003. Stan told the accused that the documents listed out the components which the accused needed to purchase. The accused then signed these document.
b)         The accused handed over to Stan a few pre-signed cheques and Unison’s company stamp.
c)         Stan called the accused to check whether the money had been credited into the accused’s bank account. The accused informed Stan that the money had been credited.
d)         Before police investigations had begun, Stan handed to the accused a paper folder containing invoices, purchase orders and delivery orders relating to the four transactions that form the subject matter of the present charges.
Application
105.     I agreed with the prosecution that the fact that the accused had signed at least one invoice was very significant. It must have been obvious to the accused that the contents of the invoice and delivery order were false. The accused knew full well that Unison had not sold SMPL any electronic components and in fact, these components did not exist.
106.     Since the accused had been told by Stan that the invoice and delivery were going to be used to support a trade financing application, he must have known that this would result in the banks being deceived into believing that SMPL had purchased electronic components from Unison.
107.     The records pertaining to Unison’s bank account clearly show large sums of money moving in and out of the account on four accounts, with an amount roughly equally 0.3% of the amount being left in the account each time. It is an entirely reasonable inference that since the accused controlled this account, he had knowledge of these transactions. As the accused was aware that the money was credited into Unison’s account, he would have realised that the deception was successful.
108.     I am of the view that taking the above evidence as a whole, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the inference that the accused had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Stan to apply for trade financing using false invoices and delivery orders.
109.     Stan’s claim that he believed this to be a legitimate transaction was of little help to the accused. Based on what Stan told the accused, it is clear that both agreed that they would apply for trade financing first and use the money obtained from the banks to purchase goods from China. It is clear from the evidence that trade financing is granted on the basis that goods have already been sold by the supplier and is not a cash advance to the applicant to allow him to make a purchase in the future. As Viscount Dilhorne stated in 
Churchill v Walton
 (
supra
):
If what they agreed to do was, on the facts known to them, an unlawful act, they are guilty of conspiracy and cannot excuse themselves by saying that, owing to their ignorance of the law, they did not realise that such an act was a crime.
Wilful Blindness
110.     The prosecution submitted that this was a situation where the accused was wilfully blind to the real nature of the transactions. In 
PP v Koo Pui Fong
 
[1996] 2 SLR 266
 at para 17, the High Court explained the concept of wilful blindness as evidence from which knowledge may be inferred:
It seems to me that it is wholly in keeping with common sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred. Thus I fully agree with the following passage of Lord Bridge in Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd (1986) 83 Cr App R 155 at p 164:
… it is always open to the tribunal of fact, when knowledge on the part of a defendant is required to be proved, to base a finding of knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion confirmed.
111.     In the present case, there was no evidence that the accused carried out the proposal of using the money credited to Unison’s bank account to pay the suppliers. Instead, there were movements of large sums of money in and out of Unison’s bank account on four occasions during this period. Furthermore, each time there was such a movement of funds, 0.3% of the sum would be left in the account for the accused to collect without him needing to do anything. Since the accused did not carry out his assigned task of buying components and paying suppliers in China, why did he continue to profit from the transactions? There was no evidence that the accused had asked about the funds going into the account or why he was not asked to carry out the plan of buying the electronic components or paying the suppliers in China.
112.     When Stan asked the accused to sign a Unison invoice and delivery order that was obviously false, the accused did not ask any questions but simply signed the documents. Similarly, when Stan handed over to the accused a folder containing the Unison invoices, delivery orders and purchase orders, the accused, on seeing those documents, must also have known they were not genuine because Unison never sold SMPL any electronic components. Yet there was no evidence that the accused asked anyone about how these documents came into existence.
113.     I can only conclude from all of this that the accused was shutting his eyes to the obvious and infer from his wilful blindness that he knew exactly what was happening. Simply put, he did not need to ask any further questions about the activity in Unison’s bank account or about the Unison documents because he knew all along that false Unison documents were being used to support applications for trade financing.
What if the accused did not have knowledge of all the details of the conspiracy?
114.     In 
Er Joo Nguang and Another v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
 at para 34, the learned Chief Justice held:
“The essence of conspiracy is the combination and agreement by persons to do some illegal act, or to effect a legal purpose by illegal means. 
While it is not necessary that all the alleged conspirators should be equally informed as to the details of the conspiracy, it is essential that there is a ‘meeting of minds’ so that they are all aware of the general purpose of the plot
. In this case, the general purpose of the alleged plot was to commit CBT of PW13’s goods.”  (emphasis mine)
115.     Even if I did not infer from his wilful blindness that the accused had knowledge of the whole scheme, I am of the view that the facts disclosed by Stan was sufficient in and of itself to satisfy the requirement that there be a “meeting of minds.”  As I have stated earlier, the accused was told that this transaction involved trade financing and that he would used the money obtained from trade financing to purchase goods from China. Next, he signed at least one invoice and delivery order which was not genuine on the face of it and was aware that money was credited to his account as a result. From these facts, it was already clear that the accused knew that the general purpose of the transaction was to obtain trade financing from banks through the submission of false documents.
116.     Therefore, I found that the prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence in its own case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the guilty knowledge required to sustain the charges of abetment by conspiracy.
117.     The accused, by electing to remain silent, failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, his silence ran the risk of reinforcing the prosecution’s case.
Accused remaining silent
118.     In 
Oh Laye Koh v PP
 
[1994] SGCA 102
 the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge is at liberty to draw any inference as may appear proper from the failure of the appellant to give evidence on oath, including the ultimate adverse inference that the appellant is guilty of the offence charged. The Court of appeal also noted that what inferences were proper to be drawn from an accused’s silence would depend on the circumstances of the particular case, and it was a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense. The Court of Appeal further observed that the trial judge had to determine whether on the totality of the prosecution’s evidence, together with any inference that could properly be drawn from the accused’s silence, the accused’s guilt could be established beyond a reasonable doubt.
119.     I found the conversations between Stan and the accused to be of critical importance to this case as they went directly to the issue of what the accused knew about the transactions. Likewise, the question as to whether the accused signed any of the invoices or delivery orders was significant since those documents on the face of it were not genuine. The defence did not lead any evidence about these conversations and did not even challenge Stan’s evidence on this area.
120.     Ultimately, there were a whole host of factors that made it obvious that the transaction which the accused agreed to was not a legitimate one. This led me to make the finding that the accused was wilfully blind to the obvious and I inferred that he had the requisite knowledge from this.
121.     Given the nature of the evidence against the accused, I would have expected the accused to explain why he believed that the transaction was legitimate if he were truly innocent of the offence charged. The inference to be drawn from his silence is that he knew full well the nature of the transactions and that it involved the use of false documents to deceive banks.
Prosecution’s submission on abetment by intentional aiding
122.     The prosecution submitted as an alternative that even if the court did not find the requisite meeting of minds necessary to sustain a charge of abetment by conspiracy, the court could nevertheless convict the accused on an alternative charge of abetment by intentional aiding.
123.     In view of my findings on the original charge of abetment by conspiracy, it was not necessary for me to consider amending the charge. However, I agreed with the prosecution that in view of the accused’s positive actions of providing Stan with pre-signed cheques and his company stamp, making available his bank account, and signing at least one invoice and delivery order, the offence of abetment by intentional aiding was also made out.
Conclusion
124.     After carefully reviewing the evidence in this case, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the silence of the accused reinforced the prosecution’s case against him.
Appeal against sentence
Mitigation
125.     Counsel informed the court that the accused was a first offender with no antecedents. He has two children and is in the midst of divorce proceedings. In addition, Counsel also submitted that the banks did not suffer any losses as a result of the transactions and that the benefit the accused received was very small.
Sentences of the co-conspirators and other related persons
126.     Alvin Wong Siow Hiong was not a co-conspirator named in the present charges against the accused. However, his sentence is relevant as his role was similar to that of the accused as he allowed his businesses, K2 and Dara, to be used to facilitate the deception. Wong pleaded guilty to 9 charges under s.420 read with s.109 of the Penal Code with 116 charges taken into consideration. For the charges that were proceeded with, the amounts ranged from $232,389.78 to $294,400.06. He was sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment per charge with sentences for three of the charges to run consecutively for a total sentence of 63 months’ imprisonment.
127.     Yip Mun Keong was only involved in the trade financing applications involving Alvin Wong and was not named as a conspirator in the present charges. He was convicted after a trial on 87 charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to between 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge. Three of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 54 months’ imprisonment. Yip appealed against his sentence and conviction but the appeal lapsed on 22 April 2005: 
PP v Yip Mun Keong
 
[2005] SGDC 82
.
128.     Stan Lee Chew Seng pleaded guilty to 6 charges under s.420 read with s.109 of the Penal Code with 58 charges taken into consideration. He was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment each for two charges involving amounts of $44,025.60 and $102,137. For the remaining four charges which involved sums between $240,357.60 and $261,569.87, he was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment per charge. Three of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 51 months’ imprisonment.
Sentencing precedent
129.     I took note of the following case which was decided in the High Court after I had sentenced the accused for this offence. In 
Cheong Sing Whee v PP
 MA 72/2005/01 (unreported)
[18]
, the offender, the Managing Director of Sin Yuh Industries Pte Ltd (“Sin Yuh”) pleaded guilty to a charge of under s.420 read with s.109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspirarcy to cheat a bank by falsely claiming that one Henko Industries Pte Ltd (“Henko”) had received from Sin Yuh a total of $1,034,000 as downpayment for 18 machines when this was not the case. A second charge was taken into consideration. Sin Yuh purchased $2,574,000 worth of machinery from Henko. Sin Yuh was only able to pay $429,000 of the purchase price. DBS Bank offered to finance 60% of the purchase price of the machines provided Sin Yuh had paid 40% of the purchase price or $1,034,000. In order to obtain this financing, the offender and his co-conspirators conspired to issue letters to DBS claiming that 40% of the purchase price was paid, leading DBS to grant the loan. Subsequently, Sin Yuh defaulted on the loan and DBS sold the machines but still incurred a loss of $676,320. The offender was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment by the trial judge while a co-accused, who had his charge reduced to s.417 read with s.109 of the Penal Code was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the High Court reduced the sentence to two years’ imprisonment.
130.     I was of the view that the present sentence was nevertheless consistent with this later decision, after the distinguishing factors in 
Cheong Sing Whee v PP
 are taken into account. In particular, 
Cheong Sing Whee v PP
 involved a genuine sale and purchase of machinery and real collateral was provided. In addition, the accused highlighted several personal mitigating factors.
Sentencing factors considered
131.     In the present case, the four charges involved amounts of $255,488.80, $252,213.20, $303,207.13 and $100,586.00 respectively. These charges were similar to charges the other conspirators faced.
132.     Therefore, in determining the sentence, I had in mind the general principle that where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for their role in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility: 
Sarjit Singh Rapati v PP 
 
[2005] 1 SLR 638
 at para 63.
133.     On the other hand, an accused who claims trial may end up with a heavier sentence compared to a co-accused who pleads guilty. This may occur because the co-accused who pleads guilty receives a discount to his sentence, and not because claiming trial is an aggravating factor in itself: 
Kuek Ah Lek v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 252
 at para 66.
134.     The accused’s role in the scheme was important as it resulted in SMPL obtaining over $911,000 of funds from banks over a short period of a month. The accused also benefited from this scheme.  It should be noted that according to Stephanie, Wong had told her that his bank had queried Wong about the sudden movement of funds in and out of his accounts
[19]
, therefore, it was crucial for SMPL to get another supplier to prevent the bank from querying further.
135.     Nevertheless, I took the view that the accused was less culpable than the other conspirators as he was only involved in a total of four transactions. Therefore, after taking into account all the above factors, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence that was considerably less than the sentences which the other conspirators received.
136.     After careful consideration, I sentenced the accused to 9 months imprisonment for the fourth charge which involved an amount in excess of $100,000 and to 12 months imprisonment for the remaining charges which involved amounts in excess of $200,000. In view of section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code, I ordered two of the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment.
137.     At the time of preparing this judgment, the accused is on bail pending the hearing of this appeal
