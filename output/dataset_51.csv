Cur Adv Vult
In this action the plaintiffs claimed against the defendants for losses and damages suffered by them arising from the structural damage caused to a stretch of the sewer mains at the Marina Centre which the plaintiffs had constructed for the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of the Environment (""MOE""). The plaintiffs alleged that the damage to the sewer pipe was attributed to the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents in carrying out drainage works in the vicinity. At the hearing of this action, the parties agreed that I should deal with the issue of liability first with damages to be assessed separately.
The facts are as follows. As long ago as 9 December 1980, the plaintiffs were awarded a contract by the Sewerage Department of (""MOE"") to supply and lay 1,238 metres of 600 mm diameter thickwall reinforced concrete (""R.C."") pipes and 296 metres of 375 mm thickwall R.C. pipes for the sewer mains from the Marina Centre to Beach Road. The plaintiffs commenced their works in December 1980.
On 14 January 1981 the defendants were awarded a contract by the Drainage Department of MOE for the supply and laying of box culverts running alongside portions of Nicoll Highway from Marina Centre to the start of Merdeka Bridge. The entire drainage works were sublet by the defendants to Lai Seng Engineering Contractors Pte Ltd (""LSE""). LSE completed the work of clearing the site of trees and saplings on 17 March 1981. Thereafter LSE commenced the excavation of their drainage trench by the open cut method. The sewer mains between MH 34 to 35 ran parallel to the drainage system.
In or about April 1981, when the plaintiffs had already completed the excavations for the sewer line, the timber formwork for the sewer trench for the stretch of the sewer line from MH 34 to MH 35 tilted. At the site meeting held on 4 May 1981, it was agreed between the Sewerage Department and the Drainage Department of the MOE, the plaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants would stop work from 4 May 1981 in order to allow the plaintiffs to complete their sewer line. On 29 June 1981 an agreement was reached between the parties whereby a sum of $30,000.00 was to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs for the damage to the trenchworks without any admission of liability and it was further agreed that the plaintiffs would proceed with their laying of sewer pipes and the defendants would commence their work only after the plaintiffs had completed their work.
The defendants backfilled their drainage excavation to enable the plaintiffs to repair their timber formwork and to complete their sewer line between MH 34 and MH 35. Repairs were carried out to the plaintiffs' timber formwork and the plaintiffs proceeded to complete their work of laying the sewer line. The plaintiffs completed their sewer line from MH 34 to 35 to 36 in November 1981 and the defendants recommenced their work after the plaintiffs completed their work of laying the sewer pipe for this stretch of the sewer line.
A series of joint surveys were carried out to the completed sewer line between MH 34 and MH 35 by the representatives of the plaintiffs and the defendants on 19 and 27 November 1981 and on 1 December 1981 to determine the levels of the pipe laid between MH 34 and MH 35 and to check the alignment of the sewer line. The alignment of the sewer line between MH 34 to MH 35 was found to be satisfactory.
At an inspection that was carried out on 30 June 1982 by the MOE, the sewer line from MH 34 to 35 was found to be badly misaligned.
The plaintiffs' cause of action as pleaded in paragraph 11 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim states: 
""11 The defendants so negligently carried out their said excavation works that they damaged the plaintiffs' adjacent sewer line construction by causing the same to go badly out of alignment.
PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE
(1) Failing to take steps to stabilise the sides of the defendants' excavation by means of proper timbering works.
(2) Failing to provide any or adequate timber lining to the said excavation.
(3) Failing to provide proper strutting to the defendants' drain excavation.
(4) Causing or permitting the unchecked movement of earth in the vicinity of the said excavation.
(5) Failing to provide and/or adhere to any or adequate drawings/designs for the said excavation works.
(6) In the circumstances, adopting the wrong constructional techniques in the excavation for the drain construction."".
The defendants in paragraph 6 of their Defence states: 
""6. As to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Statement of Claim, the defendants deny that the work carried out by them subsequent to 1 December 1981 caused the damage to the plaintiffs' sewer line.
THE ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT 
The issues in this action are as follows: (1) Did the defendants owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs? (2) If so, what is the standard of care and scope of the duty by which I am to decide whether there is a breach of duty? (3) Have the defendants failed to show the requisite care that is required of them? (4) Did the breach cause damage to the plaintiffs' sewer line? (5) Was the damage caused to the plaintiffs' sewer line foreseeable?
In the written submission handed in by the defendants' counsel, the defendants's first submission is that the plaintiffs must establish that the defendants had adopted the wrong techniques in the construction of the drain. Next, it was submitted by the defendants that ""the damage < to the sewer line > was not caused by the defendants' activity and that even if it was, such damage was not foreseeable"". It was further submitted that this is a case of inevitable accident, namely, that if an event could not be foreseen and if the person allegedly responsible for causing an event to take place could not reasonably foresee that harm would result, then the event is an inevitable accident.
In Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co. (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784 Alderson B defined negligence as: ""the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct human his affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent or reasonable man would not do."".
In my judgment, the plaintiffs and the defendants were carrying out construction works in such close proximity to each other that the defendants owe a duty to the plaintiffs to take care in the conduct of his affairs, in that he ought reasonably to have forseen that if he did not take such care, damage would occur to the plaintiffs' works. The report of Messrs Toplis and Harding (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Exhibit P1), who were engaged to carry out a survey of the damage caused to the plaintiffs' timber formwork for the sewerage trench in April 1981, states that ""the line of excavation carried out by N. C. Senan < the defendants > is about 5 metres from your < the plaintiffs' > trench"". Furthermore the drain that was constructed by the defendants was 3.5 metres wide. The sewer trench of the plaintiffs for the entire length of the sewer line was of a depth of about 5 metres and about 1.7 metres wide.
I shall now consider the question whether there is a breach of the duty and, if so, whether the breach caused the damage and whether the damage is too remote. In order to do that I have to deal with the evidence and the question as to what had caused the damage to the sewer line between MH 34 to MH 35. 
The plaintiffs rely on the evidence of their expert witness, Mr Fong Weng Cheong, a professional engineer, who is a partner in a firm of civil engineers. He is a qualified civil and structural engineer. In 1963 he graduated from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, with a degree in civil engineering. He obtained a Master Degree in structures in Aberdeen University in 1965. He became a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK, the Institution of Structural Engineers, UK, the Institute of Highway and Transport (UK) and the Institution of Engineers, Singapore. He is a member of the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia, the American Society of Civil Engineers and the British Institute of Management. He is registered as an accredited checker with the Building Control Division of Singapore. He had been an examiner for the Institute of Engineers, Singapore and the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK.
Since his graduation in UK as a structural engineer he worked with Mott Hay Anderson. After that he worked with the Department of Highway, Ontario, Canada as a structural engineer, He had been registered as a professional engineer in Ontario. Thereafter he worked in Singapore with the Public Works Department (Roads) as a civil engineer. Later he joined K T Philcox, a firm of consulting engineers. Thereafter he became an associate of Tahil, Wong & Partners. He then joined Chan Chee Wah Maunsell & Partners. Thereafter he joined CME as Chief Engineer. Then he started his own partnership. 
Mr. Fong was the Consulting Engineer for the plaintiffs in respect of the Marina City sewerage project. Part of the plaintiffs' obligations under their sewerage contract with the MOE is to submit trench shoring calculations (""TS calculation"") for the latter's approval. Mr Fong prepared the TS calculations on behalf of the plaintiffs and they were approved by the MOE.
When he designed his calculations for the timber shoring for the plaintiffs' trench, Mr Fong said he had to know the subsoil conditions in that area in order to predict the lateral forces that will be acting inwards towards the site of the plaintiffs' trench. From the soil investigation results furnished by MOE, he said that the soil consists of a topfill of 5 metres or thereabouts and the immediate underlying soft submarine clay of 12 metres or thereabouts. In his opinion, a proper trench strutting system to transfer the lateral forces from one face of the trench to the opposite face of the trench would be necessary for such soil conditions. A mere cantilever supplied by timber planks or runners would result in the significant inward movement of the planks and the acting soil due to the depth of the excavation and the relatively low sheer strength of the supporting soil.
He told the Court that he made regular site visits during the progress of the sewer line works. In one of his earlier visits he observed that there was already gross distortion to the Plaintiffs' trench. Being an engineer, he had to find what was the cause of the gross distortion to the trench. He noticed that the defendants' excavations were in close proximity to the plaintiffs' sewer line trench. Because of the depth of the excavation of fill, which is relatively weak soil, he was of the view that the defendants' excavation without a proper strutting system would affect the soil in the immediate vicinity. He then requested the plaintiffs' representative on site to inform the defendants to take the necessary measures to counter-act any possible significant movements towards the plaintiffs' trench. Mr Fong also said that he had observed on site that there were collapses of soil resulting from the face of the defendants' excavations.
In his examination in chief, Mr Fong referred to a report which was prepared by him on the structural damage to the sewer at manholes MH 34 and MH 35 (""the Technical Report"") for the plaintiffs. The Technical Report was submitted to the plaintiffs on 30 August 1982 subsequent to the discovery by MOE of the misalignment of the stretch of the sewer line from MH 34 to 35. This report pertains to both the first incident and the second incident.
In page 5 of his report Mr Fong gave the following reasons for the damage to the timber formwork for the first incident: ""In the course of excavation for the drain, disturbance to the stratum of loose fill occurred in the vicinity of the excavation. In places where there is timbering at the drain excavation which was not properly strutted, the fill moved away from the sewer line timbering. Where no timbering was provided at the drain excavation the fill simply formed a natural batter between the drain excavation and the sewer line timbering, in the course of which the fill within this location is disturbed. In both cases the lateral earth pressure on the sewer line timbering nearer the drain excavation was decreased. But the lateral earth pressure on the sewer line timbering on the opposite side of the trench remained the same. Hence there was an out of balance force tending to push the sewer line timbering towards the open cut excavation at the drain.
In conjunction with the movement stated in the previous paragraph, the very soft marine clay at the bottom of the sloping or loosened fill started to flow towards the drain excavation. Hence the sewer line timbering moved towards the drain excavation with the top of the timber members tilting away from the drain excavation."".
In Mr Fong's opinion, the damage to the sewer line MH 34 to 35 was caused by the improper construction techniques employed by the Defendants in their drainage excavations. By using the term ""improper construction techniques"", Mr Fong explained that he was expressing an opinion. When a contractor carries out an open cut excavation there will be lateral forces acting towards the trench. These forces have to be contained by temporary works to stabilise the mass of earth moving towards the trench. In the Technical Report, Mr Fong said the defendants failed to take the necessary measures to counter-act any possible significant movements towards their trench. He was of the opinion that the defendants failed to take adequate measures to stabilise the sides of the drainage trench excavation.
In page 6 of his report, Mr Fong gave the following explanation for the structural damage to the sewer line between MH 34 and 35: ""On completion of the laying of the sewer pipes and the backfilling to the trench, the timbering was removed. All gaps left by the timber members were filled by compacted soil in order to restore the fill to its original density.
When the excavation was carried out at the adjacent drain, with little or no precautions taken to stabilise the sides of the excavation, lateral confinement to the 5 metres of fill was removed. This action initiated and caused the 5 metre fill to slide on top of the very soft marine clay towards the area of least resistance, i.e. at the open cut excavation of the drain. The lateral movement of the fill would displace the completed sewer pipe in a lateral direction following the direction of the movement of the fill. At a certain stage equilibrium was reached when the soil stabilised and the displaced pipe line movement would cease. The amount of lateral displacement is dependent of the amount of the fill displacement. If there is no displacement of fill, no displacement of the pipe line is anticipated. Hence the displacement of the pipeline will take up the shape of approximately a single curve beginning at the start of the adjacent excavation and ending where the excavation ceased."".
Mr Choo Gee Peng, who was employed as a works supervisor by the defendants in 1981 gave evidence before this Court. His testimony was that after the plaintiffs had completed their sewerage works, the defendants recommenced their works. His evidence, inter alia, in his own words is as follows: ""When I commenced work the second time, the sewerage works except for certain portions had been completed. That stretch of the sewer line near where we recommenced our work have been completed.
For our drainage works we used the open and cut method. Timbering was used on certain portions of the trench only. For our worksite we used 8"" by 3"" timbering to toe-in the side of the trench. We had timbering only on one side of the trench. It was on the side nearer the sewer line.
The reason for using timbering on certain portions of the trench is because the other portions of the soil are good. No timbering is required when the soil is good. We wanted to save on costs. We then proceeded on our drainage trench using the cut and open method. We completed the digging in order to lay the drains."".
Mr Bobby Ho gave evidence on behalf of the defendants as an expert witness. He is the Managing Director of Executive Decisions Inc Pte Ltd (""EDI""). He is also a professional engineer. His academic and professional qualifications are as follows: (a) Diploma from Brighton Technical College (1960); (b) Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK, (1976); (c) Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, (1976) (d) Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia (1977); (e) Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (1977); (f) Professional Engineer, Singapore (1971); (g) Professional Engineer, Malaysia (1972); (h) Member of the Institution of Builders, London (1978); (i) Fellow of the Society of Professional Engineers, Papua New Guinea (1980); (j) Affiliate of The Institution of Fire Engineers (1977); (k) Member of The Concrete Society (1975); (l) Member of British Tunnelling Society (1975); (m) Member of International Institute of Risk and Safety Management (1986) (n) Examiner, Institution of Civil Engineers, UK. (o) Examiner, Institution of Engineers, Singapore.
Mr. Ho gave the following description of his work experience: ""From August 1960 to December 1962 I was an assistant engineer with Sir William Halcrow & Partners of London. From January 1963 to December 1964, I was the site engineer employed by Higgs & Hills Ltd of London. During this period, I supervised the building of a section of the M4 motorway. This section involved the construction of three concrete bridges, six subways, culverts and connecting roadways. I also supervised the construction of the Euston Road underpass in London.
From March 1965 to December 1966 I was the engineer employed in design supervision in the Malaysian firm of Binnie & Partners. From January 1967 to May 1969 I was employed as Deputy Agent for the construction of the Seletar Dam in Singapore by Seacon-Lian Hup Han Joint Venture.
From April 1969 to October 1972 I was a project engineer with Gammon (Singapore) Sdn Bhd. I had been involved during this period with the construction of flyovers, wharves, slipways and piling operations.
From November 1972 till now I had been the managing director of Executive Decisions Inc. Pte. Ltd (`EDI'). My company deals with civil and structural engineering consultancy. I have had extensive civil and structural engineering experience. I am a member of the British Tunnelling Society. I have experience in tunnelling work. I have given evidence in our courts previously as an expert witness."".
His evidence is that he was consulted by the defendants on the drainage works they had carried out at Marina Centre during 1981 and 1982 after the occurrence of the first incident. When he visited the trenchworks for the sewer line, the plaintiffs' trench had already been backfilled. He said he was instrumental in 1981 in negotiating a settlement between the defendants' insurance company together with the defendants on a monetary compensation to be paid to the plaintiffs. He only visited the site once.
Subsequent to that, the insurance company of the defendants contacted him at a much later date on another claim made by the plaintiffs between the similar stretch of manhole (MH34 and 35). He requested the insurance company to obtain relevant information from the defendants so that he could look into the matter why the sewers which have been completed between MH34 and 35 was damaged. The defendants did not supply to the insurance company any of the information requested by him and his appointment died a natural death.
Subsequently, at a very much later date (i.e. two years before the hearing of this action), he was requested by the defendants to help out on a court action brought by the plaintiffs. He then requested for information similar to those he requested earlier. This was supplied through the sub-contractor of the defendants. After much discussion and many meetings with the defendants' sub-contractor and the defendants, he was able to collect sufficient information to enable him to form his opinion which is contained in his report (Exhibit D1). Mr Ho made it clear that his report was prepared on the basis of information supplied to him by the defendants.
At page 10 of his report, Mr Ho states: ""4. OPINION
4.1 As informed to us, the present claim was for the damage caused in horizontal displacement of the laid 600 mm diameter thickwall reinforced concrete sewer pipe for approximately 80 metres upstream of MH 35.
4.2 According to the report from the inspection carried out by the Sewerage Department, the displacement in alignment of the completed sewer pipe was badly affected. It is unfortunate that the amount of displacement could not be established or was recorded and whether any vertical displacement took place.
4.3 We therefore carried out calculations to establish the type of failures that could occur and this could be categorised under two headings < i.e. (i) failure due to upheaval and (ii) failure due to slip circle > viz:
a) checking of the factor of safety (F.O.S) against the upheaval of the excavated drainage base; and
b) check on the factor of safety against a slip-circle failure.
............. "".
On page 8 of his report, Mr. Ho states: ""3. DESCRIPTION OF WORKS
3.1 During the latter (sic) period of October 89, discussions were conducted with Mr Choo Gee Peng (hereinafter referred to as CGP) of LSE to provide a brief description of the works carried out by NCS < i.e. the defendants > . The final information requested from NCS was handed over to EDI on 29 September 89 in the form of Drawing No ENV/SEW/MC/5B representing the plan details and longitudinal section of the laid sewer line.
3.2 It was confirmed that the damage sustained to the damaged sewers was upstream of MH 35 for an approximate 80 m. in a lateral direction. However CGP was not able to confirm in which lateral direction the sewer pipe had moved nor whether there was any vertical displacements.
3.3 The method of work employed by LSE in the construction of the drain was by pure open cut method in the area concerned.
3.4 By arrangement mutually agreed between the Sewerage Department, < the > Drainage Department and both contractors, EHC was allowed to complete the laying of the sewer works whereby LSE then continued with the drainage works.
3.5 As the works method employed by LSE was by pure open cut through the use of a dragline in the form of a 19RB excavator, the 19RB excavator was sited astride the trench excavations works.
3.6 The centre line between the box culvert and sewer line was 8 m apart.
3.7 Due to the method of excavation and close proximity of both works, the dragline was virtually siting on top of the completed sewer line with the excavated material dumped and stockpiled to the rear of the machine in heaps with gaps in between for access to the area of the works (see Appendix C and D).
3.8 Soil report which was primarily carried out during the period for the first claim fortunately was still available and from the geotechnical reports carried out, EDI was able to carry out calculations pertaining to the ground conditions during the time of the construction of the box culvert by LSE.
3.9 As can be seen from Appendix C, the dragline excavator would be sitting directly above the sewer line with the excavated earth placed behind the machine.
3.10 Of relevance at that point of time was a letter, ref: ENV/DRA/2/81 dated 29 September 81 written by the Engineers of the Drainage Department that a section of the bottom of the excavation carried out by LSE had upheaved. This is great relevance to the fact that there was in effect ground movement at the time of constructing the drainage works.
3.11 Different sets of calculations were then carried out for different conditions pertaining to the safety and stability of the area of < the > works and these are all further expressed in our opinions."".
Mr Ho's hypothesis is that the misalignment of the sewer line may be caused by the weight that was brought to bear on the sewer line by the load that was placed on the side of the sewer trench that has already been backfilled. He attributed the misalignment of the sewer line to an earth slip that has taken place. In page 16 of his report, Mr Ho states: ""5. Conclusion
5.1 From our calculations, it can be shown that local upheavals in the excavated drainage works has occurred when the excavating machine was sitting directly above the slope of the excavated surface. This, however, would not have caused any damage to the sewer pipe as the upheaval of soil was in a vertical direction.
5.2 The damage caused to the sewer line has been occasioned from the stockpile of excavated earth on site. The slip-circle failure would have developed when the machine moved away from the excavated works especially at night, stoppages of work or when other works are in progress. Fortunately, the factor of safety lies within the marginal band for slip-circle failures to develop in most cases but when the machine and other constructional plant are parked beside the stockpiled earth, a full slip-circle failure will result in horizontal movement of earth towards the excavated face, thereby displacing the sewer pipe in a horizontal direction."".
The question which arises is: were the defendants acting reasonably in adopting the open and cut method of excavation? Mr Bobby Ho is of the opinion that they were. In his examination in chief, Mr Ho said: ""The open cut method is the normal method adopted by drainage contractors for the depth concerned and for the Marina area where the defendants were working. It would be the normal way of carrying out drainage works.
From the information available to me, the method adopted by the contractor is reasonable if it is viewed during the tender stage from the tender drawings supplied to him and the conditions on site which were known to him. After he has moved onto the site and found out that there was another contractor working astride him at eight metres and digging a trench deeper than his, the status of his tender changes because the site conditions are now different. He hasn't got the opportunity to change his Bill of Quantities because he is not allowed to do so contractually. He has to construct it in accordance with what is laid out in the contract drawings. From my own perusal of the contract documents, it would not be possible for the defendants to know that there was another contractor astride at eight metres away, if it is not shown in the drawings. The sewerage works were not shown in the defendants' contract drawings given by the Drainage Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
.............
I was aware of the first incident where the trenchwork of the plaintiffs was tilted. I assisted in the negotiations of the parties whereby the plaintiffs' claim against the defendants was settled. ... Arising from these negotiations, I was told later on that the defendants had to wait for the plaintiffs to complete their sewer line before proceeding with their work. During the discussions, I did recommend that the sewer line should be completed before the defendants' work was completed. When the sewer line works were completed, the sewerage trench would be backfilled. The defendants' contractor was on an open site. It would be logical for him to carry out his digging works by the open cut method. Under those circumstances it would be reasonable for the defendants to carry out works in the way they had but one has to bear in mind the experience of the contractors in carrying out the works. I mean that if the contractor had fully qualified and experienced personnel on site who are familiar with ground conditions (i e soft ground), he might change his method of work and use other methods besides the open and method. In this case, it is my opinion that even if he had an experienced engineer on site and considering the depth of excavation of his drainage trench, he would still recommend an open cut method because of the depth which is considered not deep. One has to bear in mind when considering excavations to relate the depth of an excavation with its width. In particular, we should not confuse the trench excavated by the sewerage contractors which is a deep and narrow in width trench. The trench by the sewerage contractor being narrow in width has to be supported on its vertical sides otherwise it would collapse without any doubt. The trench which is excavated by the drainage contractor is considered shallower, firstly because of its depth in terms of figure and secondly in consideration of its depth against its width. The width is more than twice its depth. The width of the drainage trench is more than twice its depth. The risk of the sides collapsing need not necessarily depend on the width in relation to depth but it also depends on the soil condition particularly on the stability of the slope.
For the present contract of the defendants, there was no soil investigation report. The Drawing Department when calling for tenders for drainage works of such nature normally do not supply soil investigation reports. They have supplied soil investigation reports for large drainage contracts worth more than $10 million.
From what I heard from DW1's evidence, he carried out timber protection works on certain portions of the trench on the side nearer the sewer works. Apparently he did not carry out timber protection works over the entire length. I believe he did this because he had timber protection works to protect the slope of his excavation at areas which were slipping. He mentioned that where the slope at other areas was good, there was no protective measure. DW1 would be right in doing what he had done when he considers only his own works."". (Emphasis added by me.)
Although Mr Ho's opinion is that the method of excavation adopted by the contractor is reasonable, he made it clear that his opinion was subject to certain qualifications which have been reproduced in italics.
It was submitted by the plaintiffs' counsel that the defendants as builders have a duty to investigate and examine the land before they build on it and the extent of that duty was to be determined by what a careful and competent builder would have done in the circumstances. In support of their contention, the plaintiffs' counsel referred to paragraph 8-39 at page 577 of Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence, 8th Edition and to the case of Batty v. Metropolitan Property Realisations Ltd < 1978 > Q.B. 554. Paragraph 8-39 of Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence 8th Edition at page 577 states: ""The extent of a builder's duty to investigate and examine land, before they build on it, was to be determined by what a careful and competent builder would have done in the circumstances. Such duty was not restricted merely to observable defects on land, owned by them or to which they had a legal right of entry, if a careful and competent builder would have observed defects on neighbouring land and would not have built until either there had been further investigation of the site, together with the adjoining land, or he had received a satisfactory report from an expert on the condition of the subsoil"".
In my judgment the defendants had not acted reasonably in the circumstances of this case by adopting the open cut method of excavation for the drainage trench. They merely did what they thought were logical. They were only concerned with the safety of their own works. They were interested in saving costs. If the defendants had acted in a manner which a careful builder would have done in the circumstances of this case, they would not have in my view carried on with the open and cut method of excavating the drainage trench after they had entered onto the site and discovered a deep sewer trench next to their proposed drainage works without having carried out an investigation of the soil conditions or sought the advice of a professional engineer on the progress of their works. If not, a careful builder would have done so after the occurence of the first incident. Mr Choo who was supervising the works acknowledged that the works of the plaintiffs and the defendants were so close that they would cause problems. Mr Choo confirmed that the defendants did not carry out any tests for the soil conditions. In his examination in chief, he said that if he was aware of the peculiar conditions of the soil he would have adopted other methods of digging the drainage trench.
The defendants did not engage any consulting engineer to advise them on the drainage excavations. Mr Bobby Ho said he was called in to assist the defendants on the claim made by the plaintiffs in respect of the first incident. Mr Ho said he visited the site once and that he was instrumental in negotiating a settlement between the defendants and the plaintiffs. In cross- examination, Mr Ho made it clear that he was not the defendants' consulting engineer and he was never engaged to design any temporary works for the defendants. It was not disputed by Mr Ho that had the defendants done better trench works as the plaintiffs had done, the second incident would not have happened.
Mr Choo in his cross-examination gave the following evidence: ""Q For this drainage trench, did you have any trench shoring calculations? A Not for this trench.
Q No expert came along and told you how to do timbering? A I recall that my site manager asked a professional engineer to come and look at the site.
Q What did the professional engineer do? A I cannot recall.
Q Was the toe-ing in your responsibility? A It was a joint effort with my site manager."".
During his re-examination, Mr Choo confirmed that the professional engineer who came to the site was Mr Bobby Ho.
What is the standard of care and the scope of the duty of the defendants? In my judgement it is the standard of care that is expected of them as careful and competent drainage contractors and not the standard that is expected of the defendants based on the type of personnel that they have in their organisation. Paragraph 10-59 in Chapter 10 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edition at page 490 states: Standard of a reasonable man. The standard normally set by law is that of a reasonable and prudent man. Negligence is a species of fault liability; ... The standard is objective, which means that no allowance is made for the `personal equation', which would take account of each individual's weakness, unless, in the first place, it is obvious or known that he is in some way abnormal, in which case his conduct is judged according to the persons that is expected from persons of that type; or secondly, in some emergency, which has been thrust upon a person, his weakness will be relevant in determining whether he acted reasonably. ...
... The standard of the reasonable man's conduct has been described as follows. `Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do; or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. ..."".
Did the defendants' breach of the duty of care cause the damage to the sewer line? Both Mr Fong and Mr Ho offered different theories on the cause for the structural damage to the sewer line. Mr Fong's opinion is that the damage to the sewer line was caused by the failure to maintain the structural integrity of the drainage trench and to safeguard against soil movement. Mr Ho's opinion is that the damage was occasioned by an earth slip that was brought about by the stockpile of earth on the site and the weight of the 19RB excavator. I prefer Mr Fong's version for a number of reasons. In Mr Ho's hypothesis, for the slip circle failure to take place there must be vehicles and a stockpile of earth of the aggregate weight of 50 tonnes on the site. The photographs in the Toplis and Harding report (Exhibit P1) which show the damaged timber formwork of the sewerage trench near MH 35 and the adjoining drainage trench do not show any stockpile of earth at all. When Mr Ho was asked during his cross-examination to offer an explanation for the first incident, he gave the following answers: ""Q During the first incident, the integrity of the sewerage trench was maintained by timber shoring and struts made according to Mr Fong's design. Nonetheless, upon the drainage works commencing the sewer formwork tilted? A Yes.
Q Assuming that the sewerage trench had not been dug, would there have been movement of soil when the drainage trench was excavated? A I have in my report stated the occasion in which a slip can occur. It is shown in page 13 of my report. Yes, there will be a slip depending on certain conditions.
Q I refer to PB11, the lower photo. Using your hypothesis, where did you reckon the RB19 was placed and where was the stockpile of earth? A I was not there when they were doing their work. The photo shows that the trench on the right hand side of the sewer line appeared to have been dug and abandoned. Either the drainage trench was dug first and the sewerage works was excavated or vice versa I can't say when.
Q If such is the case i.e. the RB19 was not located at left of the sewer formwork, what do you attribute the tilting of the formwork to? A I have not done any investigation on the causation of the first incident. I was purely a party in mediating a settlement terms.
Q You advised a settlement by payment to the plaintiffs? A Yes.
Q Why? A That is the quickest way to do a settlement.
Q Going back to the photo on PB11, in order to obtain the critical mass for a slip, there must be vehicles and stockpile of earth of the aggregate weight of 50 tonnes? A Yes.
Q And if such slip occurs, the top of the formwork will tilt away from the drainage trench? A Yes.
Q If there was no vehicle or stockpile giving that critical mass of 50 tonnes then your hypothesis will not explain the tilting shown in the photos of the first incident. A My report has nothing to do with the first incident. It considers the conditions existing for the second incident.
Q What are those conditions? A The sewer has been laid, the backfill has been carried, timber runners have been removed and the ground has been returned to its original state."".
Mr Ho accepted Mr Fong's opinion that the earth from the drainage trench moved towards the sewerage trench as regards the first incident. Mr Ho's testimony on the this point during his cross-examination is as follows: ""Q Would you agree that the earth at the bottom of the drainage trench after digging would have destabilized? A What do you mean by ""destabilized""?
Q. (1) There is loosening of soil. (2) The weight of excavated earth is not there. Correct? A The second one is correct. The loosening is confined to the very top layer (i.e. formation level) where the excavation is carried out.
Q The difference between the bottom of the sewerage trench and the drainage trench would be 1.15 m? A Yes.
Q In Appendix C to the soil report in Exhibit D1, you agree that Mr Fong's theory is correct? A I can't answer the question until you qualify that.
Q Would you agree with Mr Fong that notwithstanding the depth differential between the sewerage trench and the drainage trench and given the fact that - (a) the differential at the most was 1.15 m; (b) there was a stress relief in that the mass of the excavated earth no longer was acting? on the bottom of the drainage trench; (c) the bottom of the drainage trench varied by a depth of 0.25 m to 1.25 m was resting on very soft marine clay for the fact that the sewerage trench timber work tilted at the top away from the drainage trench, the ground at the bottom of the sewerage trench had moved forwards the drainage trench? A I don't disagree with any of the points except for one. That is the different depth between the two structures. In my disagreement, the movement of earth would have affected only up to the formation level of the drainage excavation works. The tilting in the case of the first incident which is not the subject of the claim here, I agree can tilt away from the drainage excavation. What I would like to bring out is that the question posed to me is addressed to the first incident which I have not addressed in my report.
Q You are in no position to quarrel with Mr Fong's opinion that the earth from the sewerage trench moved towards the drainage trench notwithstanding the depth differential? A I have no quarrel so long as it is confined to the first incident."".
In my judgment the model behaviour explained by Mr Fong as regards the first incident is likely to hold true for the second incident. Mr Fong was familiar with the site. He had seen the sewerage trench and designed the timber formwork. Mr Ho only visited the site once and his hypothesis is based on information which were fed to him and he has never seen how the defendants carried out the excavations for the drainage trench either before or after the first incident.
Was the damage to the sewer line between MH 34 and 35 forseeable by the defendants? The defendants' counsel submitted that the damage was not forseeable. I have no hesistation in coming to the conclusion that it was. The first incident had resulted in damage to the timber formwork to the sewerage trench and also caused misalingnment to the sewer pipe that was already laid. The sewer pipe was laid on a foundation that is supported by tanalised wooden piles. After they were laid, their alignment will be checked and if it is satisfactory the pipe will be haunched according to specifications. Later the timber formwork will be removed and the trench backfilled with sand on both sides to a certain level and then backfilled with soil. Mr Fong's evidence is that if there is any lateral movement of the soil that resulted from a force acting on the face of the drainage trench excavated by the defendants, it will lead to horizontal movements of the sewer line and that will cause the pipe to be misaligned. In my view the damage in this case is not of the kind that is not forseeable as in the Wagon Mound case < 1961 > A.C. 388. I have also considered the point made by Mr Ho that if there is poor compaction of the backfill to the sewerage trench, it might cause the misalignment. There is no evidence before me that the compaction of the backfill was not carried properly to the satisfaction of the staff of the Sewerage Department of MOE. Mr Fong's opinion is that poor compaction, if any, would not cause any horizontal displacement of the sewer pipe. After the sewer pipe is supported by piles and the subsidence, if any, would be counteracted by the piles. I accept Mr Fong's explanation.
In his written submission counsel for the defendant referred me to the case of Singapore Finance Ltd v. Lim Kah Ngam (S) Pte Ltd and Eugene H L Chan Associates (Third Party) < 1984 > 2 MLJ 202 which he described as the leading local authority on the tort of negligence relating to building activity which causes subsidence or damages to an adjoining property. In the said case the defendants had constructed a coffer dam but as a result of de-watering of the site, an adjoining building had developed cracks. The owners of the building sued the defendants. The court held that the common law principle in Acton v. Blundell (1843) 152 E.R 1223 applied in Singapore, namely, the owner of the soil is entitled to all that lies beneath the surface; that the person who owns the soil may dig therein and apply all that is there found to his own purposes at his free will and pleasure; and if in the exercise of such right he intercepts or drains off the water collected from underground springs in his neighbour's well, this inconvenience to the neighbour falls within the description of damnum absque injuria, which cannot become the ground of an action. I do not think that case is of any assistance to us. In that case the owners of the adjoining land sued the owners of the land on which the building activity was carried out. In our present case, the plaintiffs were contractors who constructed sewer mains on State land and the defendants were contractors constructed drains on State land. Both contractors were carrying out works for the Ministry of the Environment!
Accordingly for the reasons given above, I hold that the defendants are wholly liable to the plaintiffs for the damage caused to the stretch of the Marina Centre sewer mains from MH 34 to 35. I give interlocutory judgment for the plaintiffs with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. The plaintiffs will be entitled to their taxed costs.",1992-01-25 00:00:00,SG High Court
