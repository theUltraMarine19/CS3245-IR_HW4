2702557,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 17) [2015] NSWSC 1601,"Judgment (on APPLICATION TO DISCHARGE ILL JUROR - T1771)


	
	JOHNSON J: The present trial has entered its seventh week. A member of the jury is absent today and was absent yesterday. The particular juror has had ongoing health problems of different types which have given rise to jury notes and lost parts of sitting days on 24 September 2015 (MFI21), 7 October 2015 (MFI50) and 15 October 2015 (MFI67). In addition, a medical certificate was provided with respect to this juror dated 15 October 2015 (MFI71) and today, a certificate dated 26 October 2015 (MFI 103).
	
	
	It is not necessary to outline in any detail the health issues which have affected this juror during the course of the trial. There is material indicating that he is a type 1 diabetic. He is said now to have acute gastroenteritis which would see him unavailable to attend until tomorrow. What happens thereafter, of course, would be a matter of speculation in the light of experiences with the juror so far in the trial.
	
	
	I recorded yesterday (T1754-1755) some factors relevant to this juror, and the history of his participation in the trial.
	
	
	The position has been reached, in my view, where the Court should consider the discretionary discharge of the absent juror under s.53B Jury Act 1977. In my view, s.53B(a) is activated in this case because there is a pattern of illness affecting this juror, with the prospect of continuation of illness of one form or another, so that it would be open to the Court to form the opinion that the juror has become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror for the balance of the trial.
	
	
	In any event, even if there was some question about the capacity to form that opinion, s.53B(d) allows the Court to discharge a juror if it appears to the Court that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the function of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.
	
	
	The history of this juror during the trial and his continuing unfitness today points strongly in favour of the exercise of discretion to discharge the juror.
	
	
	I note that the Crown and counsel for all Accused persons support that course of action.
	
	
	I should observe, as well, that the other 11 members of the jury are urging the Court to take that course, even though it has not been revealed by me to the balance of the jury that discharge is an available option. There is a note from the jury today (MFI104) which asks the Court to continue with a jury comprising 11 members.
	
	
	The jury note states that:
	


“Many of us have commitments as we were originally told this would be a 6 week trial.”

And:

“We would hope that a frequently absent jury member doesn't have to slow down the progression of the trial."" 


	
	I have to say that the jury note summarises quite neatly the position that has now been reached and the appropriate decision which will be made.
	
	
	Accordingly, for the purpose of s.53B Jury Act 1977, I discharge the absent juror who has been identified for the purpose of this trial as Juror H.
	
	
	It is necessary then for the Court to move to the second issue. Section 53C Jury Act 1977 requires the Court, if it has discharged a juror in the course of the trial, to consider what should happen next. If the Court is of the opinion that to continue the trial with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, the Court is obliged to discharge the balance of the jury: s.53C(1)(a).
	
	
	The Court is of the opinion there is no such risk and, subject to s.22 of the Act, the Court is empowered to order that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors: s.53C(1)(b).
	
	
	Section 22 of the Act provides relevantly that a criminal jury cannot drop below a number of 10 persons without consent. That provision is not presently relevant as the question is whether the trial proceed with a jury of 11.
	
	
	For the purpose of s.53C(1), I am of the opinion that there is no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice if the trial proceeds with a jury of 11.
	
	
	I have also considered other discretionary factors which are to be taken into account in the second phase of the decision-making process concerning the continuation of the trial. In this regard, I have kept in mind what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Le v R [2012] NSWCCA 202.
	
	
	This trial is in its seventh week. The evidence is likely to finish today. Closing addresses will commence, if not later today, certainly tomorrow. All parties seek that the trial continue with a jury of 11.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the discretion weighs very strongly in favour of the continuation of the trial with a jury of 11.
	
	
	Accordingly, I direct that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors, being a jury of 11 persons.

2702570,Howard v R (No 2) [2015] NSWDC 318,"Judgment


	
	On 4 June 2015 I delivered a judgment on an appeal. The appeal was by Damon John Howard against sentences imposed upon him by a Local Court Magistrate at Taree. For the reasons that I then gave, I adjourned the appeal proceedings to today.
	
	
	In summary, I had in mind that Mr Howard should serve more time in custody but also I was prepared to give him more time on parole provided he had a bed at a rehabilitation centre and could be released from custody to that facility.
	
	
	The case has come back before me today. I have additional material. Exhibit B is an update assessment of an earlier pre-sentence report. Mr Howard has successfully completed a horticulture course whilst he has been in custody and the report says that he has been accepted into a rehabilitation centre. The report said that ""Mr Howard appears motivated to address his alcohol and drug issues"" and is willing to enter into rehabilitation. The author thought that Mr Howard would benefit from some supervision.
	
	
	Exhibit 2, tendered today by Mr Scott (who is still appearing for Mr Howard), was a note from the senior program support officer at Benelong's Haven dated yesterday confirming that Mr Howard ""has been accepted into our Program based on the information provided"" on his application form. A bed is available from today.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report, I should say, did mention one institutional misconduct item a couple of months ago. I know nothing about the circumstances of that. It is not enough for me to change the course of action which I had in mind.
	
	
	When I delivered judgment in June, I said that if a bed was available at a rehabilitation centre I would reduce Mr Howard's non-parole period to nine months and direct his release, provided he goes straight from prison to a centre and stays there for the duration of any program, accepting recommendations and directions by staff. I now propose to resolve his three outstanding appeals in that way.
	
	
	I propose to impose one aggregate sentence instead of three by using s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The sentences I would have imposed, but for the aggregate sentence, are these. In respect of count 1 of larceny, I would have imposed the nine months sentence imposed by the Magistrate and I would have fixed a non-parole period of six months as imposed by the Magistrate. In respect of count 2 of larceny, I would have imposed the twelve months sentence fixed by the Magistrate and the nine month non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate. Each of those two sentences and the non-parole periods would have commenced on 20 January 2015. In respect of count 8 - and I am referring to the numbered offences in exhibit A - I would have imposed the nine months prison sentence fixed by the Magistrate commencing 19 October 2015. However, in respect of that sentence I would have fixed a non-parole period to commence on 19 October 2015 and to expire today.
	
	
	The formal orders which I make in allowing this appeal are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine these appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences. Instead of the sentences imposed by the Magistrate, I would impose an aggregate sentence of 18 months. The aggregate sentence commenced on 20 January 2015 and will expire on 18 July 2016. I fix a non-parole period of nine months and nine days commencing 20 January 2015 and expiring today, 28 October 2015.
	
	
	Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing the release of Mr Howard on parole today. The parole is subject to these conditions –
	



	
	That he be released into the care of Ms Laura Pope today;
	
	
	That he proceed directly from the correctional centre today to Benelong's Haven Rehabilitation Centre at 2054 South West Rocks Road, Kinchela;
	
	
	That he admit himself to that rehabilitation centre and remain at that centre for the duration of any program for which he is accepted. In addition, he must accept all reasonable recommendations and directions by staff at that centre.
	
	
	If he is released from that centre at the end of the program but before the expiry of his parole period, he is to accept supervision from Community Corrections and comply with all reasonable recommendations and directions from officers of that service, particularly concerning relapse prevention interventions upon completion of rehabilitation and personal development.
	
	
	Within five working days of release from Benelong's Haven, Mr Howard is to contact the Community Corrections Service at Kempsey.

		13 January 2016",2015-10-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702582,R v Maybir (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 1740,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This judgment is concerned with an objection by senior counsel for the accused to the tender by the Crown of a number of prior statements by a witness for the purpose of re-establishing her credibility which was seriously challenged in her cross-examination. The provisions of ss 45 and 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) are relevant. Leave is required in respect of prior consistent statements: s 108(3).
	
	
	The witness concerned is the accused’s former wife, Ms Naomi Brealey. At the conclusion of her evidence the Crown tendered statements she had made to the police on 25 August 2012 and 6 September 2012 in their entirety as well as paragraph 20 of a statement of 29 May 2013 and paragraph 6 of a statement of 6 August 2014.
	
	
	I have ruled that the evidence would not be admitted (T599.22). The following are my reasons.
	


The issue


	
	The deceased was a 7 year-old boy who the Crown alleges was fatally assaulted by the accused. The child was said to have been injured on the morning of 20 May 2013 and was found deceased about 24 hours later.
	
	
	There is no direct evidence, on the Crown case, as to how the fatal injuries were caused. An autopsy examination revealed there were a number of other injuries, some likely caused at about the same time and others in the preceding days and weeks. Of particular significance (to the Crown case), there were bruises on either side of the child’s head as well as an associated fracture to the left parietal bone in the region of the temple. There will be expert evidence to the effect that these injuries are consistent with having been caused by a hand grabbing the child's face with the thumb causing a bruise and the fracture on the left side and fingers causing three bruises on the right.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused engaged in a pattern of physical abuse of the deceased in the guise of “discipline” and “punishment” in the months preceding his death. He subjected the child to a variety of assaults including striking him with implements. There were other forms of mistreatment as well.
	


The Crown’s evidence concerning similar assaults by the accused of his own children


	
	The Crown has adduced evidence of the accused having in the past regularly grabbed his own children (when they were toddlers) by the face with fingers and thumb extended from ear to ear. Ms N Brealey gave evidence that he did this and there is evidence from her mother, Ms Ecelini Brealey, which tends to confirm it. Ms N Brealey also gave evidence that the accused would scream at the children; he would smack them with implements such as a spatula, a wooden spoon or a ruler; and, when they were in public, he would pinch the children underneath the upper arm. Such evidence was allowed as tendency evidence: R v Maybir (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 1737.
	
	
	This evidence is of significance to the Crown case given there is no direct evidence of how the critical injuries to the deceased were caused. It has added significance given the anticipation that the accused will contend that it was the deceased’s mother who caused the facial bruising and the associated fracture and will also contend that she was primarily responsible for harsh physical “disciplining” of the child.
	


The challenge to the Crown’s evidence


	
	Ms N Brealey's evidence about these acts of physical ""discipline"" and ""punishment"" of their children prior to the marriage breaking down and the couple separating in July 2012 was disputed and she was cross-examined with some vigour. It was put to her that she had complained to the accused that he did not physically discipline the children at all and that it was she who was involved in physical discipline (T283.5). It was put to her that he never grabbed at the children's faces in the manner she described (T275.48; 311.43; 312.15). It was put that it was her, rather than him, who grabbed the children’s upper arms and struck them with implements such as a wooden spoon (T282.30; 283.35).
	
	
	In the course of the cross-examination, Ms N Brealey was asked about applications she had made for apprehended domestic violence orders against the accused. Specifically, she was asked about statements dated 25 August 2012 and 6 September 2012 that she made in support of such applications. The point of the cross-examination was to establish that in neither of those statements did she make any allegation of the assaults she had said in her evidence that the accused had committed against the children. She said a number of things in response to this questioning, including that the concern she had was not that he was grabbing at the faces of the children but that he was going to kill her and the children and “that was ultimately a bigger threat that I was concerned for” (T277.45). When challenged as to this she cited an incident when the accused was driving with her and the children in the car and he accelerated in the direction of a telegraph pole, saying “he was going to kill us all” (T278.5).
	
	
	Ms N Brealey also said that in the context of making the apprehended domestic violence order applications she was concerned about the accused’s threats to take the children away; he would take them into the bush and do whatever he wanted to them; to “take them and permanently do harm to them”; and that she and the children had been in danger and were living in a terrible time of violence and aggression and were exposed to the accused’s unstable behaviour (T278.43; 279.40; 280.22; 295.50). She said she told the officer taking her statement that the accused was “very abusive and aggressive and threatening” and she and the children were “in imminent danger” (T296.32).
	
	
	The incident which included the accused threatening to kill Ms N Brealey and the children by driving into a telegraph pole was the subject of her statement of 6 September 2012. In that statement she spoke of other aspects of an incident that occurred that day but did not mention this specific allegation. Ms N Brealey appeared to be nonplussed about the omission of this from the statement and suggested that it should be there, or should be in another statement she made. She maintained that she had told the police officer taking her statement about it (T303.11; 307.10). It was put to Ms N Brealey that the reason it did not appear in the statement of 6 September 2012 was because it did not happen but she maintained that she had signed a statement which included it; just not in the one that counsel was referring to (T308.18). Ultimately it was established that she had included that allegation in statements she made on 29 May 2013 and 6 August 2014.
	
	
	Mr Brady SC questioned Ms N Brealey about the later statements. In the course of this the critical portion of paragraph 20 of the statement of 29 May 2013 that the Crown now seeks to get into evidence was adduced before the jury:
	


“Q. You say [in the statement], ‘He would go into fits of rage when he was angry and driving. He would drive in the direction of a telegraph pole to scare us’, do you see that?

A. Correct.

Q. Then you would say, ‘or scream at the top of his lungs striking the dashboard frightening me the kids?’

A. Yes, I do see that.” (T309-310)


	
	The Crown also now seeks to get into evidence the content of paragraph 6 of the statement of 6 August 2014. Mr Brady’s cross-examination included the following as to that statement:
	


“Q. And finally in that statement you actually said at paragraph 6, ‘When we were driving he said words similar to 'I'm going to drive us into a pole and we're all going to die. If you're not with me at least we can all die together’. You said that in August 2014, right?

A. After some experience of having to make up locations I realised that it was something I had to specifically request.

Q. So by that stage 23 months after you say it had occurred?

A. It happened numerous times before that too.

Q. Just didn't happen, did it?

A. The frightening feeling of it is something certainly is traumatic and you don't forget.” (T310-311)


	
	(Whilst Ms Brealey’s answers might not appear from the transcript to have been responsive, in the sense of agreeing that what was put in fact appeared in her statement, the impression she conveyed in giving these answers was that she accepted that it did appear in her statement.)
	
	
	Towards the end of the cross-examination it was put to Ms N Brealey that she was “not telling the truth” about the accused “grabbing his kids and squeezing their head” and “assaulting the kids the way you described”. She denied such propositions. (T312)
	


Re-examination


	
	In re-examination, Ms N Brealey was referred to the cross-examination about the lack of reference to the “driving at the tree” [sic – pole] incident in her statement of 6 September 2012. She agreed that “the first time that detail did appear was in your statement of 29 May 2013.” (T314.40)
	


Determination

6 August 2014 statement (paragraph 6)


	
	Working backwards, the Crown sought to get before the jury that in Ms N Brealey’s statement of 6 August 2014 she said that she reported to police on 6 September 2012 an incident which included that she and the children were in the car and the accused’s “moods varied from being upset, crying to yelling and screaming” and “he said words similar to ‘I’m going to drive us into a pole and we’re all gonna die, if you’re not with me at least we can all die together”.
	
	
	This evidence is already sufficiently before the jury. The tender of the relevant paragraph of the statement adds little. Placing it before the jury in written form would only tend to give it more prominence than is warranted. Leave to tender this prior consistent statement is refused.
	


29 May 2013 statement (paragraph 20)


	
	The same could be said in respect of paragraph 20 of the statement of 29 May 2013. Whilst the paragraph is relatively lengthy and provides some context for the critical sentence, that sentence was adduced in the course of the oral evidence and tendering it in written form is both unnecessary and would give it unwarranted prominence. Leave to tender this prior consistent statement is refused.
	


6 September 2012 statement


	
	Mr Brady’s cross-examination of Ms N Brealey in relation to her statement of 6 September 2012 included that she had told the officer and it was recorded in that statement that the accused assaulted her as she was getting out of his car and that her father became involved (she added that her father “protected my children and I”) (T281.38). Mr Brady also obtained her agreement that the statement included that the accused pushed her when she had the children in her arms (T296.47). She, implicitly at least, agreed that there was nothing in the statement about the specific assaults by the accused upon the children that she had given evidence about. She claimed that the officer had not asked her to “go into specifics” but that she had said that “I feared for my children’s safety and myself as we had been living in a situation of severe domestic violence” (T297.40). She was not challenged as to the latter.
	
	
	Mr Brady did not challenge that the 6 September 2012 statement was concerned with an incident in which Ms N Brealey said the accused pushed her against the car while she had the two children in her arms (T298.40). He read to her the entirety of paragraphs 4 through to the first sentence of paragraph 6 which described the events of the car journey during which she had claimed that the accused had threatened to drive the car into a pole. She agreed that it did not contain any mention of that incident but doubted that this was the complete statement; she had a recollection of telling the police officer about it and seeing that it was included in a statement she had made. She thought this copy of her statement might be “ingenuine”. She said she had her copies of all of the statements she had made in her car. A short adjournment was taken to allow her to retrieve them.
	
	
	When the Court resumed Ms N Brealey maintained that she had told the police officer about the driving into the pole threat but the officer had omitted it from the statement. He had shortened the reference by inserting that during the course of the journey, “We had a further discussion”. (That explanation does not make sense because the full sentence states: “We had a further discussion about where the kids and I were going to stay”.) She added that:
	


“I did sign a statement saying it did happen. It was just a different statement than the one you are referring to.” (T308.21)


	
	Mr Brady then put to her that the statement she was referring to was one she made in August 2014.
	
	
	It is clear that Ms N Brealey set out a description of the events of 5 September 2012 in her statement of 6 September 2012. It is equally clear that it contained no reference to the driving into the pole aspect. Her explanation for it not appearing in that statement did not include any claim that she was more focussed upon other aspects of the events of 5 September 2012. If she had, then placing the statement before the jury would be useful in allowing them to assess such a claim. The only purpose that would be served by the jury having access to the statement would be to confirm that there is no mention of the driving into the pole aspect in it; but that is abundantly clear and common ground.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence that is already before the jury, the statement of 6 September 2012 has no relevance.
	


Statement of 25 August 2012


	
	This statement appears to have been the first made by Ms N Brealey in which she complained of the conduct of the accused. It is relatively short (10 paragraphs) and, aside from formal parts, states the following matters:
	


The accused was “extremely aggressive and unpredictable”.

Ms N Brealey was assaulted by the accused on 11 November 2011.

Thereafter the accused was increasingly verbally abusive towards her and her parents.

On 10 August 2012 he forced the locked front door of her home. He then verbally abused her and tried to force himself upon her.

He left threatening and harassing messages for her on her phone twice on 20 August 2012.

She had received about 200 text messages in the past month, some being “quite threatening and harassing in nature”.

She felt “scared, intimidated and harassed” and believed that he was stalking her.

She feared for her safety and that of her family.

She did not mind if he wanted to see the children.


	
	The statement is said to be relevant in re-establishing Ms N Brealey’s credibility. Given the complete absence of any allusion to the accused being violent towards the children, I fail to see how it could possibly do that. The fact that she did not mind if he wanted to see the children tends to the opposite effect.
	
	
	Having regard to the purpose said to be served by the tender of the statement, I cannot see how it passes first base; it is not relevant: s 55 of the Evidence Act. Even if it was, any probative value that it might have is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	


Ruling


	
	It is for these reasons that I have ruled that none of the statements are admissible.

		20 November 2015",2015-10-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702583,ARSIOTIS v REGINA [2015] NSWCCA 275,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the applicant by Acting Judge Delaney, for the offence of dealing with more than $100,000 reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime, contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The total amount involved was $990,050. It was not disputed that the potential financial benefit to the applicant was 7.5% of the total sum, namely, $74,253.75.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence. It was not disputed that he did so at the earliest possible opportunity.
	
	
	The sentencing judge imposed a sentence on the applicant of 20 months imprisonment, commencing on 6 January 2015, but made a recognisance release order for his release on 5 January 2016. The factual findings made by his Honour, the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant, are not in dispute in this application. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to set them out.
	
	
	In imposing a sentence, the sentencing judge remarked that the applicant was “entitled at common law to a 25% reduction in sentence” for his plea of guilty. His Honour was presumably referring to a discount calculated by reference to the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice. Whatever be the case, it has not been contended in this appeal that a discount of 25% was inappropriate.
	
	
	However, in reaching his conclusion on sentence, his Honour made the following remarks:
	


“I am satisfied that had this been a sentence after trial that the sentence would have been a sentence of 24 months imprisonment. He is entitled to 25% discount for a plea of guilty. In my opinion, the appropriate sentence to apply after taking into account all of the matters to which I have referred is a sentence of 20 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. In other words he is entitled to a release order after 12 months”.


	
	The difficulty which has given rise to the application for leave to appeal is that a 25% discount on a sentence of 24 months would have resulted in a sentence of 18 months imprisonment. If the ratio between total sentence and the period served prior to the recognisance release order (60%) was maintained, the applicant would have been entitled to release on a recognisance release order after serving 10 months and 21 days.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal is based on this erroneous calculation by the sentencing judge. The Crown, very properly, has conceded that the judge was in error in this regard.
	
	
	Having regard to the error which has been made, it is necessary to resentence the applicant. Although it is necessary for this Court to independently exercise its sentencing discretion (Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601), in the present case, this task can be undertaken on the basis of the undisputed findings by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	I have taken these findings into account, along with his Honour’s findings as to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. As I have indicated, they were undisputed and I agree with them. I have also taken into account the affidavit of the applicant in which he deposed of difficulties he was suffering as a result of a knee injury arising out of a fall he had on 16 June 2015. It was suggested by counsel for the applicant, in oral argument, that this should warrant a greater variation between the recognisance release period and the total term of imprisonment than the 60% envisaged by the sentencing judge. Having regard to the objective nature of the offence and the limited difference that a variation would make, I am unable to accept this submission.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, taking these matters into account and the extent to which the plea of guilty facilitated the course of justice, the appropriate sentence is a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 18 months, commencing on 6 January 2015 and expiring on 5 July 2016. I would also make a recognisance release order under s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) for the applicant’s release on recognisance after the expiration of a period of 10 months and 21 days after the commencement of his sentence, namely, on 25 November 2015.
	
	
	In the result, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and, in lieu thereof, impose a sentence of 18 months imprisonment, commencing on 6 January 2015 and expiring on 5 July 2016.
	
	
	Order, pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), that the applicant be released from imprisonment on 25 November 2015, upon entering into a recognisance in the sum of $250, without security, to be of good behaviour for the period from 26 November 2015 up to and including 5 July 2016.
	



	
	HIDDEN J: I agree.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I also agree.

2702587,Newman v R [2015] NSWCCA 270,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: After a trial in the District Court at Sydney the Applicant was found guilty on 26 May 2014 of a charge that on 30 April 2013 at Padstow he wounded Craig Hanslow with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(a), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years. The standard non-parole period pursuant to s 54A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) is 7 years.
	
	
	The Applicant was refused further bail following the return of the jury’s verdict. On 25 July 2014 he was sentenced. Her Honour Judge Huggett imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months commencing 26 May 2014, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, the balance of the term being 3 years.
	
	
	The Applicant seeks leave to appeal from the severity of the sentence upon the sole ground that it was “manifestly excessive as to both the head sentence and non-parole period and some other sentence less severe should be imposed”.
	


Facts


	
	The facts of the offence, established by the jury’s verdict upon the case as presented by the Crown and by the further findings of her Honour, were as follows. The victim, Mr Hanslow, suffered from multiple sclerosis. He used a motorised mobility scooter to move around and when not on the scooter he required the aid of a walking stick. For some time up to about 2009 Mr Hanslow had been in a relationship with a Ms Guilfoyle. Subsequently, commencing prior to April 2013, Ms Guilfoyle formed a relationship with the Applicant. This latter relationship was still current in the time of the trial.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 30 April 2013 Mr Hanslow attended a unit occupied by the Applicant and Ms Guilfoyle at Padstow. The three of them consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. In the early evening the Applicant left the unit temporarily to take a dog to a park opposite the unit building. Whilst the Applicant was absent from the unit Ms Guilfoyle and Mr Hanslow spoke to each other about purchasing more alcohol.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards the Applicant returned. He accused Mr Hanslow of having stolen money from Ms Guilfoyle. The Applicant gave evidence that Ms Guilfoyle had told him this had occurred. A physical altercation then took place within the unit. Conflicting evidence about this fight was given by Mr Hanslow, the Applicant and a third man, Mr Mumford, who had arrived at the unit by the time the fight began. Her Honour was satisfied on this evidence that the fight had “involved the use of a knife that came into relatively superficial contact with the [Applicant’s] cheek and also made contact with and cut Ms Guilfoyle’s finger when she tried to recover it either from the hand of the [Applicant] or the hand of [Mr Hanslow]”. The altercation also involved the Applicant striking Mr Hanslow with a metal pole at the unit, in circumstances where the Applicant stated that he thought Mr Hanslow was going to attack him.
	
	
	This incident within the unit ended with Mr Hanslow leaving the premises on his scooter. Two minutes after he had departed the Applicant took a metal bar from the unit and also left. Mr Hanslow had reached a point about 300m to 350m away from the unit building, in a public street, when the Applicant caught up with him. Whilst Mr Hanslow was seated on his mobility scooter the Applicant struck him once to the head with the bar. Mr Hanslow suffered swelling of the left parietal area of his head, an abrasion over the back of his head and a laceration requiring five sutures.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that there was only one blow and that the injuries to Mr Hanslow could “be described as falling towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness”. There was no evidence of any lasting effect of the assault on the victim.
	


Applicant’s subjective circumstances and antecedents


	
	The Applicant was born on 14 February 1992 and was therefore 21 years old at the date of the offence. He had an extremely unstable early childhood. His mother abused alcohol and cannabis from when he was an infant. She had four other children, none of them to the Applicant’s father. One of the other four children died and the others were taken from their mother’s care by the Department of Community Services.
	
	
	The Applicant’s father obtained custody of him when he was 22 months old. His father had another partner and she had other children. Until the Applicant was 5 years old he continued to have contact with his mother but this was physically and emotionally abusive.
	
	
	At school the Applicant had significant learning problems. By 2007 (at age 15) he was assessed as having a borderline intellectual deficiency. By that date he was residing in a residential care unit managed by the Uniting Church. His scores on various tests of general intelligence placed him in the third percentile (scoring better than or equal to 3% of children his age). The psychologist who assessed the Applicant in October 2007 considered that he had been “severely impacted by a compromised and chaotic growing up experience” and referred to “abuse and neglect in his early childhood [which] may have impacted his social and behavioural development”. This background was found to have contributed to “severe conduct issues and antisocial behaviour”. He was at that time recorded as having a history of chronic depression and “possible psychotic thought disturbance”. He was being medicated for depression.
	
	
	In May 2013 a coordinator of the Uniting Church Residential Care Facility where the Applicant had resided issued a report in his capacity as the Applicant’s “former caseworker and program coordinator”. This report included the following:
	


“Due to the traumas [the Applicant] experienced in his past [he] presented some challenging behaviours which at times resulted in physical violence/outbursts where [he] would appear to go into a deep rage and could not be reached by reasoning. No one was ever harmed during these episodes rather furnishing and walls would be punched. …. [the Applicant] made significant development growth in his two years living in [the facility] and on reaching 18 years old moved into independent living and is currently doing well in his relationship and social functioning. I believe that [the Applicant] poses no danger to himself or the public and while not knowing the circumstances to his current dilemma, in knowing him, believe this to be out of character.”


	
	In a report dated 30 October 2013 a psychologist who had worked with the Applicant on trying to manage his behaviour reported that he “was able to identify binge drinking as a contributing factor to having difficulty managing anger outbursts”. The psychologist found that attempts to set the Applicant goals and strategies to amend his behaviour were impeded by the limitations of his poor ability in reading and writing.
	
	
	Ms Guilfoyle provided a letter to the Court which was received in evidence on the sentence proceedings. She stated that the Applicant regretted what had occurred in the attack on Mr Hanslow and that he had not consumed alcohol since the incident. Ms Guilfoyle said that their relationship continued and that she is engaged to be married to him. Medical evidence before her Honour established that he had suffered from depression for some years prior to this offence and was using prescribed antidepressant medications.
	
	
	His adult criminal record consists of an offence committed in July 2010 (aged 18 years): destroy or damage property and enter enclosed land without lawful excuse, ordered to pay fines of $100 in each case. Children’s Court matters have been considered but are not further identified in these reasons, having regard to s 15A, Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) and the fact that the reasons will likely be available to the public on the internet.
	


Objective seriousness and consistency with comparable cases


	
	In so far as there was only one blow inflicted and the injury sustained by the victim was moderate and without lasting effects, the wounding in this case was, as her Honour said, at the lower end of the scale of seriousness. Notwithstanding the intent necessarily found by the jury, the bodily harm actually inflicted by the Applicant was not in the event grievous: compare Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209. On the other hand, the offence was aggravated by the circumstances that the offender used a weapon (s 21A(2)(c), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and the victim was vulnerable (s 21A(2)(l)).
	
	
	The circumstances which give rise to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm vary widely and the range of culpability for the offence is vast. Whilst recognising that sentences passed in other more or less comparable cases cannot be treated as confining the sentencing discretion within boundaries different from those laid down by Parliament (Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]), some consideration of sentences imposed on other occasions is essential if consistency is to be achieved.
	
	
	In order to take into account, at all, a sentence passed upon a different offender for an offence against the same section but arising out of unrelated circumstances, regard must be had to all of the factors which the sentencing court had before it on that other occasion. That is, the objective circumstances of the commission of the offence, whether sentence was passed following a plea of guilty or after a trial, the antecedents and personal attributes of the offender, whether a standard non-parole period was applicable and so on. In Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59], Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ held:
	


“[59] Similarly, recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass a sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.” (Emphasis in original).


	
	That passage has equal application when this Court is considering whether a sentence passed at first instance was manifestly excessive. Wong v The Queen (supra) was concerned with sentencing for offences against Commonwealth laws but the passage quoted is concerned with sentencing principles generally and is not founded upon anything peculiar to Commonwealth criminal law.
	
	
	Also in Wong v The Queen (supra) Gleeson CJ said:
	


“[6] … All discretionary decision making carries with it the probability of some degree of inconsistency. But there are limits beyond which such inconsistency itself constitutes a form of injustice. The outcome of discretionary decision-making can never be uniform, but it ought to depend as little as possible upon the identity of the judge who happens to hear the case. Like cases should be treated in like manner. The administration of criminal justice works as a system; not merely as a multiplicity of unconnected single instances. It should be systematically fair, and that involves, amongst other things, reasonable consistency.”


	
	The requirement of reasonable consistency, to be sought by consideration of all features of comparable cases, was reiterated in Hili v The Queen (supra), in the judgment of the plurality. After quoting the above passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ their Honours said:
	


“[53] Next, in seeking consistency, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. … Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.

[54] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [303]-[305], Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ‘Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts’. But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ‘the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence’. Past sentences ‘are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence’. When considering past sentences, ‘it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned’.”


	
	These principles were reiterated in Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462, a case concerning sentencing under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). At [28] and [29] French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ referred to both Wong v The Queen (supra) and Hili v The Queen (supra) in support of the requirements of “systematic fairness” and “reasonable consistency” in sentencing, applying “to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events” as well as to the punishment of co-offenders under the parity principle.
	
	
	In a number of decisions of this Court concerning sentences for offences against s 33(1) the objective gravity of the wounding has been reasonably comparable to that inflicted by the Applicant upon Mr Hanslow. Some of the cases considered below involved a less serious attack upon and injury to the victim and some were more serious in these respects. It is evident from the sentencing decisions that the degree of severity of the wound or bodily harm actually inflicted and any long term effects of the injury upon the victim are factors to be given considerable weight in determining the length of the sentence.
	
	
	The comparable cases considered below include some involving charges under s 33(1)(b) (causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so). An offence charged in those terms inherently involves an allegation of a more serious outcome for the victim than in the case of an offence under s 33(1)(a) (of which the Applicant was convicted). However there is no sharp delineation between the class of violence and injury which may be charged under subpar (a) and that which may be charged under subpar (b). Some more serious instances of wounding may be not greatly different from lower order instances of grievous bodily harm. Accordingly, it is warranted to consider some of the s 33(1)(b) cases for comparative purposes.
	
	
	The following cases are considered in a sequence which follows, generally, an ascending order of seriousness of the wound or bodily harm inflicted. Porter v R [2015] NSWCCA 59 is an exception, where this Court evidently attributed the objective seriousness of the offence in large part to the circumstance of the offender having sought out the victim on the latter’s rural property late at night, rather than to the degree of violence and injury. Each of the cases referred to was decided against the yardstick of a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	In R v Rudd [2010] NSWCCA 71 a 62 year old man of otherwise good character struck a single blow with a machete to the arm of the victim, in an altercation which was the culmination of a long running dispute between neighbours in a country location. He pleaded guilty to a charge under s 33(1)(a). After allowing a 15% discount for the offender’s plea, a head sentence of 3 years was imposed, with a non-parole period of 2 years to be served by way of periodic detention. Without the discount this would have been 3 years 6 months and a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months. A Crown appeal against inadequacy was dismissed.
	
	
	In R v Dickinson [2004] NSWCCA 457 the offender attended a dwelling occupied by his former female partner. He was 25 years old. He attacked with a knife a man who had formed a relationship with her. The victim’s hands were cut seriously in the course of defending himself. At first instance, following a plea on arraignment to a charge under s 33(1)(a), a head sentence of 2 years was imposed, wholly suspended. On a Crown appeal to this Court the sentence was increased to a fixed term of 2 years and 2 months to be served by way of periodic detention. This would have been 2 years and 6 months but credit was allowed for 4 months under which the offender had been subject to the suspended sentence prior to determination of the appeal. If there was a discount for the plea it is not stated in the judgment. Any discount must have been slight as the plea came late. The fact that this was a Crown appeal contributed to the lenience shown. Barr J “would at first instance have imposed a sentence of full time custody”: [40].
	
	
	In Nowak v R [2008] NSWCCA 89 the 21 year old offender attended a wedding reception and was asked to leave after heated words between three of his friends, on the one hand, and members of the wedding party on the other hand. As he was being escorted from the premises the offender swung a vodka bottle at the face of one of the persons escorting him, breaking the bottle over the victim’s face causing facial lacerations and a broken nose. On pleading guilty to a charge under s 33(1)(a) the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of the term of 2 years. This was after allowance of a 25% discount for an early plea of guilty. Without the plea of guilty the head sentence would have been 4 years, comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months and a balance of the term of 2 years and 8 months. The offender was a university student of otherwise good character. A severity appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	In R v Miria [2009] NSWCCA 68, as the victim attempted to leave a hotel in the early hours of the morning, the offender raised a schooner glass above his head in his right hand and brought it down to smash it over the back of the head and neck of the victim. He pleaded guilty to a charge under s 33(1)(b) at the earliest opportunity and in the District Court was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment wholly suspended following implicit allowance of a 25% discount. Over the previous 5 years the offender had committed three other assaults in hotels. He was on a recognisance to be of good behaviour at the time of this offence. The judgment of this Court on the Crown’s appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence does not reveal the age of the offender. The Crown’s appeal was upheld and he was sentenced to a term of 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of the term of a further 2 years. In resentencing, this Court expressly allowed the 25% discount, without which the head sentence would have been 5 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months.
	
	
	R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19 also concerned a charge under s 33(1)(b). The offender injured a police officer during an incident concerning the towing away of the offender’s motor vehicle which had been illegally parked. He rammed the police officer with his vehicle. The officer had to jump onto the bonnet to avoid being crushed. His arm was then broken when he rolled off the bonnet as the offender accelerated away. The officer sustained a degree of permanent disability in the arm as a result. Following a trial and a verdict of guilty, a lenient sentence was determined in the District Court. On a Crown appeal this Court imposed a head sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, the balance of the term being a further 2 years and 6 months. The offender had a minor criminal record and was aged 27 years at the date of the offence.
	
	
	Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 85 was a severity appeal concerning a charge under s 33(1)(b). The offender with three others attended the victim’s office seeking to recover a disputed debt claimed by the offender. The offender and others punched the victim and when he fell to the floor the offender stabbed him in the chest area and thereafter continued to punch and kick him. The victim suffered a severe laceration to his right wrist and superficial wounds to the chest, abdomen and forearm. The offender pleaded guilty about three weeks before the date fixed for his trial and a 15% discount was allowed. There was a strong subjective case in terms of otherwise good character and positive community involvement. He was aged 49 years and in a stable domestic relationship. A head sentence of 5 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 3 years. Without the discount this would have been 5 years 10 months with a non parole period of 3 years 6 months.
	
	
	The offender in Porter v R [2015] NSWCCA 59 was charged under s 33(1)(a). In furtherance of a dispute concerning theft of motorcycles from the victim’s property, in relation to which one of the occupants of the property had made allegations about the offender to police, the offender attended the property at 1:45am armed with a machete. The victim was woken by the offender knocking on the door and went outside to investigate. He saw that the offender was concealing something behind his back and sought to restrain him. The offender pushed the victim to the ground and struck him with the machete. The victim defended himself with his left arm and sustained an 8 centimetre laceration which required suturing. The offender fled the scene. The offender was 21 years old, of Aboriginal background with a history of loss of family members in violent circumstances, symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and possible mild intellectual disability. He was allowed a 25% discount for an early plea of guilty. A head sentence of 5 years with a 3 year non-parole period was imposed, which would have been 6 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 years but for the discount. This Court dismissed a severity appeal. At [51] the features of the incident which were particularly noted as contributing to its seriousness were that the offender went to a rural residential property in the early hours of the morning to disturb the occupants, carrying a machete in furtherance of an existing dispute, escalating it to one of violence using a weapon.
	
	
	Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215 was another s 33(1)(b) case. During an argument in a hotel the victim escalated the confrontation to a physical struggle. In the course of this the offender tackled the victim causing him to crash into the front door of the hotel, smashing some glass which cut the victim’s scalp. As the struggle continued the offender struck the victim with a glass causing him to fall to the floor with a “gaping wound to his facial area and under the throat on the left side”. This required a large number of stitches although the long term effects on the victim were slight. The offender was 32 years of age, of Aboriginal background, respected in the community for work with rural youth. He had two prior convictions for common assaults. He was sentenced after trial in a manner which this Court found to involve error. On resentencing a head sentence of 7 years was imposed with a 4 year non-parole period.
	
	
	In R v Pearson [2002] NSWCCA 429 the charge was laid under s 33(1)(b). The offender attended at the home of the victim, who had commenced a relationship with the offender’s estranged wife. At the time the victim was severely disabled with a fractured femur and injuries to his knees and to one ankle as a result of a motor accident. He was wheelchair bound. After the front door of the victim’s home was opened by the offender’s estranged wife, the offender forced his way inside and found the victim lying on a futon bed. The offender punched the victim repeatedly, applied pressure to his throat with his thumbs as if to strangle him, then kicked him in the stomach, face and legs, stomped on his head, fractured his jaw, jumped on him and stabbed him in the left shoulder and neck. The victim’s injuries included split ears, a fractured jaw requiring the insertion of metal plates, stab wounds, chipped front teeth and a fractured rib. After a guilty verdict following trial the offender received a head sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of the term of 3 years. His severity appeal was dismissed. The offender was 37 years old. He was sentenced on the basis of a sustained attack which was planned and premeditated.
	
	
	In Connelly v R [2009] NSWCCA 293 the charge was laid under s 33(1)(b). The victim, accompanied by his female partner and with a baby in a stroller, entered the front yard of the offender’s property and enquired of him about repayment of a small debt. The offender came out of his house and pushed the victim over, causing the pram to capsize and the baby to become distressed. The pushing on this occasion was an assault which was taken into account on sentencing for the s 33 offence committed shortly thereafter. The victim left the property. The offender followed in a car, caught up with him and attacked him with a short baseball bat. The victim was struck heavily over the head, inflicting a ruptured cornea of one eye. As a result the victim suffered permanent loss of sight in that eye, which had to be removed. He suffered severe fracturing of the eye socket. This was repaired with multiple plates and screws. The loss of sight in one eye cost the victim his employment as a boilermaker and he suffered consequential physical and psychological symptoms.
	
	
	The attack had taken place in the presence of the victim’s wife and baby. The offender entered a late plea of guilty for which 15% discount on sentence was allowed. He was found to be of very low intelligence with some brain injury causing mild intellectual impairment. At first instance he received a head sentence of just under 6 years with a non-parole period of just under 3 years 6 months. Without the 15% discount this would have been a 7 year head sentence with a non-parole period of 4 years and 1 month and a balance of the term of 2 years and 11 months. A severity appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	In Muggleton v R [2015] NSWCCA 62 the offender was charged under s 33(1)(a) and pleaded guilty. In a beer garden, after drinking all afternoon and evening, the offender without provocation smashed a schooner glass forcing it into the victim’s face and held him by the neck and kneed his face and punched him. The victim suffered lacerations to his cheek, lips and nose and required a skin graft to repair the injury to the nose. The victim’s fiancé and their four children had witnessed the incident and the aftermath as they had come to the hotel to collect him. At the time of sentencing the victim suffered ongoing anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder. The offender was found himself to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of an assault upon him some eight years earlier. He pleaded guilty and was allowed a 15% discount on sentence. He was of otherwise good character and valued in his employment. The sentencing judge imposed 6 years and 6 months with a 4 year non parole period which, without the discount would have been 7 years and 7 months [54] with a non parole period of 4 years 8 months. The offender’s severity appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	The attack and its consequences in R v Dickinson (supra) were of an order of seriousness similar to the present case. The moderate penalty outcome in the case flowed from it being a Crown appeal: considerable restraint was exercised when resentencing. The attack in R v Rudd (supra) was again of objective seriousness comparable to the present case but without the aggravating element of vulnerability of the victim. Also, it concerned a 62 year old offender of otherwise good character who had felt himself harassed by the conduct of the victim over the long course of a dispute between neighbours. These background circumstances explain a lenient penalty.
	
	
	Nowak v R (supra) and R v Miria (supra) are comparable, in degree of seriousness of the wounding, to the present case. The sentences imposed in each of those cases, after making due adjustment for the discounts which were allowed, were notably less than the penalty imposed by her Honour on the Applicant. The subjective circumstances taken into account in Novak v R and in R v Miria were different from those relevant to the Applicant and neither of those cases involved the aggravating circumstance of an attack on a vulnerable person on a mobility scooter. Nevertheless, even when allowance is made for those variances a significant inconsistency of sentencing would be apparent if the term fixed by her Honour were allowed to stand.
	
	
	The violence of the attack in each of Chen v R (supra) and R v Chisari (supra) was considerably greater than that made by the Applicant and the degree of injury inflicted on the respective victims was substantially more than was occasioned to Mr Hanslow. Chen and Chisari were both sentenced for having caused grievous bodily harm under s 33(1)(b). Yet the sentence imposed in each of these cases was less severe than that imposed on the Applicant, markedly so in the case of Chisari. Again, consideration of the other circumstances and factors relevant to sentence in each of these cases does not permit reconciliation of the sentence imposed upon the Applicant by her Honour with the sentences imposed in Chen and Chisari.
	
	
	In Porter v R (supra) the nature of the physical attack, the weapon and the consequent injury to the victim were comparable to those aspects of Rudd v R (supra). It appears that the relatively stern sentence imposed in Porter v R was attributable to the wider circumstances, in particular the fact that the offender had sought out his victim by visiting his property in the middle of the night. In contrast with those facts, the most closely comparable cases considered here have involved spontaneous confrontations and violence – like that of the Applicant. The fact that it was the wider circumstance which the Court in Porter v R regarded as so influential make it a poor comparator for the purposes of determining whether the sentence passed on the Applicant has been shown manifestly excessive upon considerations of consistency.
	
	
	The attack in R v Pearson was very much more sustained and severe than that made by the Applicant upon Mr Hanslow. The injuries inflicted upon the victim in R v Pearson were significantly more serious; they amounted to grievous bodily harm and the charge was laid under s 33(1)(b). The attack occurred during a purposeful invasion of the victim’s home. Yet the overall term imposed by her Honour upon the Applicant and the non-parole period were in each case only 6 months less than those of the sentence imposed in R v Pearson. The imposition of a sentence upon the Applicant nearly as great as that imposed in R v Pearson cannot be rationalised by reference to any of the other circumstances of the respective cases. The victim in R v Pearson was also vulnerable, perhaps even more so than Mr Hanslow.
	
	
	Both Heron v R (supra) and Muggleton v R (supra) involved glass attacks in hotels, the attack and the level of injury inflicted having been more severe in the latter case than in the former as reflected in the relativity of sentences between the two. The attack by the Applicant in the present case and the injury inflicted were much more moderate than in either of these two sentencing decisions, to a degree not adequately reflected in moderation of the sentence imposed by her Honour upon the Applicant.
	
	
	Connolly v R is another instance of an attack vastly more serious than that perpetrated by the Applicant and with consequences far more grave for the victim. Yet the head sentence imposed on the Applicant was only 6 months less than the starting point pre-discount sentence adopted in Connolly v R and the non-parole period was only 7 months less.
	


Conclusion


	
	I consider that when the range of objective seriousness of assaults, including the range of outcomes for the victims, is considered by reference to the above cases, the Applicant’s offence should be seen as at the low end of seriousness by the measures of both the nature of the attack and the injury inflicted. The Applicant’s offence was undoubtedly aggravated by the use of a weapon and, in particular, by the vulnerability of the victim as a disabled person confined to a mobility scooter. However with these circumstances taken into account the sentence imposed by her Honour was in my view manifestly excessive. Nearly all of the above comparators involved the use of a weapon. One of them involved vulnerability of the victim.
	
	
	Whilst the Court must denounce an attack by the Applicant which was particularly cowardly considering the victim’s physical disability, the severity of the sentence by which the denunciation is expressed is to be kept in proportion to the facts of a single blow which did not actually inflict serious injury of lasting consequence. The sentence imposed by her Honour is markedly greater than sentences which have been imposed for s 33(1) offences of comparable objective gravity, making due allowance for discounts on pleas of guilty and for variations in subjective circumstances. The sentence imposed by her Honour was at the level which would be appropriate for a much more savage and sustained attack on a vulnerable person (as in R v Pearson) and/or for a wounding which inflicted much graver injury (as in Porter, Heron, Pearson and Muggleton).
	
	
	For the purposes of s 44, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act her Honour found special circumstances justifying that the non-parole period should be a lesser proportion of the head sentence than the norm prescribed by that section. Her Honour took into account that the Applicant would “need a lengthy period of supervision on his release to successfully reintegrate back into the community and thereafter prevent reoffending. In addition he requires counselling and professional help regarding his unresolved psychological issues …”. I respectfully agree with that assessment and consider that on resentencing this Court should, again, depart from the statutory ratio in s 44.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the District Court on 25 July 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	The Applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months commencing 26 May 2014 and expiring 25 July 2016 and a balance of the term of 1 year and 10 months commencing 26 July 2016 and expiring on 25 May 2018. The Applicant will become eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2702595,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 16) [2015] NSWSC 1581,"Judgment (on APPLICATION BY CROWN TO ADDUCE FURTHER EVIDENCE FROM DR MARKS - T1471)


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown is in the process of examining-in-chief the final witness in the Crown case, Dr Susan Marks.
	
	
	Dr Marks is a paediatrician who works as a Staff Specialist at the Children's Hospital at Westmead, working in the Child Protection area.    Dr Marks carried out physical examinations of C1 and C2, about which she has already given evidence.
	
	
	The Crown has foreshadowed a desire to adduce evidence from Dr Marks with respect to what might be described as distracting techniques utilised when a younger child is being examined, in particular, in the genital area. Dr Marks has given evidence (on the voir dire) of measures which she uses in this respect.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC does not object to evidence being adduced of that type. I am satisfied that evidence of that type may be adduced from Dr Marks. It is, in truth, common-sense evidence of a type that would be well-known to any parent who has taken a child to a doctor or a dentist, or otherwise in their own lives, is involved in treatment of a child which may involve the infliction of some temporary hurt to the child. That evidence will be allowed.
	
	
	The Crown wishes to utilise the term ""dissociative technique"" to describe this type of conduct. Mr Sutherland SC objects to the use of that term as it introduces a type of psychological opinion in circumstances where Dr Marks has no expertise in that field. It seems to me that the term ""dissociative technique"" may be utilised, in a general sense, to describe this conduct. However, it is quite clear that Dr Marks is in no position to express any psychological or psychiatric opinion about matters of this type. I will allow the term to be used, but if I detect that opinions are sought from her which go beyond the mere use of that as a label for what she does, I would not allow it.
	
	
	The Crown also seeks to place before Dr Marks the scenario described in the recorded interview of C1, whereby she said that she was asked before the procedure giving rise to this trial, to think of a garden as if she (C1) was a princess in a garden, to close her eyes and to think about somewhere nice. The Crown seeks to put that scenario to Dr Marks and to seek, in effect, the opinion of Dr Marks as to whether that is a form of “dissociative technique”.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that Dr Marks is qualified to express that opinion about that scenario. In my view, to seek to adduce evidence of that type from this medical practitioner would seek a psychological or psychiatric opinion from a practitioner who is not duly qualified to give it.
	
	
	It will be open to the Crown to advance such submissions as are proper and open on the evidence as to what C1 described as the preamble to the events concerning her.
	
	
	However, I will not allow the Crown to invite Dr Marks to make a comment, or express an opinion, as to what was said to have been happening when words were used to C1 in advance of the event in question at A3’s house in Wollongong.
	
	
	Accordingly, the rulings I make, arising from the voir dire, are as I have set out.

2702618,Liam Monte v R [2015] NSWDC 247,"Judgment


	
	Liam Monte (the appellant) was found guilty of one count of steal from a person contrary to section 94 Crimes Act 1900 by Mr Barnes LCM on 9 April 2014. The magistrate dismissed the charge without proceeding to a conviction pursuant to the terms of section 10(1)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	On 17 April 2014 the appellant lodged an all grounds appeal in the District Court (the first District Court appeal).
	
	
	On 9 September 2014 the appellant lodged an appeal in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, pursuant to sections 52 and 53 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act). The Supreme Court appeal was against the sentence imposed by the magistrate, by reference to the extended definition of “sentence” provided for in section 3 of the Act; which is defined to include any order made under section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on finding the person guilty of an offence.
	
	
	On 15 September 2014 the appellant sought leave to withdraw the first District Court appeal; that leave was granted by Finnane DCJ, the appeal was dismissed and the orders of the magistrate were confirmed.
	
	
	The Supreme Court appeal was dismissed by Bellew J on 31 March 2015. In the hearing before Bellew J, the appellant relied on four grounds of appeal; ground 1 involved a question of law, whilst grounds 2-4 involved mixed questions of law and fact. According to section 53 of the Act, the appellant required the leave of the Supreme Court to proceed with grounds 2-4. That leave was granted by Bellew J: Monte v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 318 at [6].
	
	
	On 27 April 2015 the appellant lodged a further all grounds appeal in the District Court (the second District Court Appeal).
	
	
	The question before me is whether the Court has jurisdiction to hear the second District Court appeal.
	
	
	Mr Boland appeared instructed by Mr Maroulis appeared for the appellant in the Local Court, the Supreme Court and on the argument before me on 28 September 2105. Ms Roatz, solicitor, appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions on 28 September 2015.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 11 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence (or both).

An appeal must be made:

within 28 days after sentence is imposed.


	
	Section 29 of the Act provides:
	


No appeal may be made to the District Court under this Part against a decision of the Local Court:

in relation to an environmental offence against which an appeal may be made under Part 4, or

that is or has previously been the subject of an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the District Court under this Part, or

that is or has previously been the subject of an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5.

Subsection (1) (c) does not prevent a person who has made an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5 from making an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the District Court under this Part if:

the Supreme Court has remitted the matter on appeal to the Local Court for redetermination, and the Local Court has redetermined the matter, or

the Supreme Court has refused leave to appeal in relation to an appeal made on a ground of mixed law and fact.

No application to set aside or vary any conviction or sentence of the Local Court that could be the subject of an appeal under this Part may be made to the District Court (whether in its civil or criminal jurisdiction) except by way of an appeal under this Part.


	
	Section 52 of the Act provides:
	


(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.

(2)   An appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction or sentence as may be prescribed by rules of court.


	
	Section 53 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves:

(a)   a question of fact, or

(b)   a question of mixed law and fact,

but only by leave of the Supreme Court.

(3)   Any person against whom:

(a)   an order has been made by a Magistrate in relation to the person in any committal proceedings, or

(b)   an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.

An application for leave to appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction, sentence or order as may be prescribed by rules of court.


	
	Section 62 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


(1)   This section applies to:

(a)   any sentence, and

(b)   any penalty, restitution, compensation, forfeiture, destruction, disqualification or loss or suspension of a licence or privilege that arises under an Act as a consequence of a conviction,

in respect of which an appeal or application for leave to appeal is made under this Act.

(2)   The execution of any such sentence, and the operation of any such penalty, restitution, compensation, forfeiture, destruction, disqualification or loss or suspension of a licence or privilege, is stayed:

(a)   except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (c), when notice of appeal is duly lodged, or

(b)   in the case of an appellant whose appeal is the subject of an application for leave, when leave to appeal is granted, or

(c)   in the case of an appellant who is in custody when the appeal is made or leave to appeal is granted, when the appellant is entitled to be released from custody on bail under section 14 of the Bail Act 2013 or bail is dispensed with under that Act.

(3)   Subject to any order of the appeal court, a stay of execution continues in force until the appeal is finally determined.

Consideration


	
	There are three compelling reasons why the Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the second District Court appeal.
	


The second District Court appeal is out of time


	
	The second District Court appeal is out of time. Section 11(2) of the Act provides for an appeal as of right to the District Court if the appeal is made within 28 days after the sentence is imposed. The sentence, being the order made pursuant to section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, was made and thereby imposed on 9 April 2014. The second District Court appeal was filed on 27 April 2015.
	
	
	The appellant contends that the stay of execution of the sentence provided for by section 63 of the Act means that the sentence was not “imposed” until the stay was lifted by reason of the dismissal of the Supreme Court appeal. That argument equates the concepts of imposition of a sentence and the stay of execution of the sentence and it can be rejected on the simple basis that they are two entirely different things. In the present case, if the sentence had not been imposed, ie the order made pursuant to section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the appellant had nothing to appeal against because he would have been neither convicted or sentenced.
	
	
	The second District Court appeal has been lodged outside of the 3 month time limit provided for in section 13 of the Act, during which period the appellant could have sought leave to appeal out of time. The power of the Court to allow the appeal to be considered out of time is not invoked because the temporal prerequisite to the exercise of that power has not been satisfied: David Grant & Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 265 at 276-7 and Commonwealth v Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 404.
	
	
	On this basis alone, the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the second District Court appeal.
	


The second District Court appeal is prevented by section 29 of the Act


	
	The second District Court appeal offends two separate provisions of section 29 of the Act. I will deal with them in reverse order.
	
	
	First, section 29(1)(c) of the Act has the effect of preventing an appeal to the District Court pursuant to section 11 against conviction or sentence that has previously been the subject of an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the Act, except as provided for in section 29(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The relevant exception provided for by section 29(2)(b) of the Act is if the Supreme Court has refused leave to appeal made on a ground of mixed law and fact.
	
	
	In the present case, the rights of appeal provided for in sections 52 and 53 of the Act are contained in Part 5 and the Supreme Court granted leave to the appellant to proceed with grounds 2-4 that involved questions of mixed law and fact: Monte at [6]. Accordingly, the second District Court appeal does not come within the exception provided for by section 29(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Second, section 29(1)(b) of the Act has the effect of preventing an appeal that has previously been the subject of an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the District Court.
	
	
	In the present case, the first District Court appeal was lodged on 17 April 2014 and withdrawn and dismissed at the appellant’s request on 15 September 2014 by Finnane DCJ. In this regard, the following submission was made on behalf of the appellant:
	


It is submitted that nothing turns upon the proposition advanced by the Crown that Mr Monte previously ‘withdrew’ his appeal to the District Court. An accused (sic) may institute and withdraw an appeal as many times as they wish (the only penalty being additional expense) as long as an appeal is ultimately instituted ‘within time’.


	
	That submission cannot be reconciled with the clear words of section 29(1)(b) of the Act and should be rejected. There are no exceptions in section 29 of the Act to the prohibition on previous District Court appeals under to Part 3, similar to the exceptions provided for by section 29(2)(a) and (b) of the Act that relate to appeals to the Supreme Court under Part 5. The sub-section clearly refers to appeals that have not been dealt with on their merits; for example it would prevent the bringing of a second appeal after the first appeal had been made but not yet determined. The sub-section clearly applies to the first District Court appeal in this case.
	
	
	In any event, for the reasons already expressed the second District Court appeal is not within time.
	
	
	The right to appeal provided for by section 11 of the Act is statutory and the exercise of that right is subject to the terms of the statutory grant: Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 108. By reason of the opening words of section 29 of the Act the second District Court appeal may not “be made to the District Court”. For these further reasons, the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the second District Court appeal.
	


The appellant’s argument reflects a basic misunderstanding of the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the Act

      The appellant’s argument


	
	The appellant’s argument can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The Supreme Court appeal was in relation to “discrete points of law that arose in the Local Court proceedings”, but that it was not an appeal against “conviction”. The second District Court appeal is the appellant’s appeal against conviction made as of right pursuant to section 11 of the Act. It is intended that the second District Court appeal will involve the agitation of issues that were outside the ambit of the Supreme Court appeal including:
	



	
	whether the appellant had the necessary specific intent to steal;
	
	
	whether the proceedings should be stayed because they are an abuse of process; and
	
	
	whether the appellant should be granted leave to call fresh evidence.
	



	
	The purpose of section 29 of the Act is to prevent re-agitation of issues that have already been decided by a superior court. It is not intended to cut off the right of an appellant to appeal against conviction without consideration of all of the evidence that was before the Local Court, because to do so would be unfair.
	
	
	The District Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the arguments raised in the Supreme Court appeal and the second District Court appeal is limited to an application of the principles outlined in Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22].
	


Determination


	
	Sections 52 and 53 of the Act provide for an appeal to the Supreme Court by any person who has been convicted or sentenced in the Local Court, against the conviction or sentence. In the Supreme Court the appellant sought the following relevant orders, that:
	



	
	the appeal be allowed;
	
	
	the decision of the Magistrate be set aside; and
	
	
	the charge laid against the plaintiff be stayed or dismissed.
	



	
	The last prayer for relief was abandoned at the hearing in the Supreme Court: Monte at [4].
	
	
	Contrary to the appellant’s argument, the Supreme Court appeal was an appeal against sentence, by reference to the extended definition of “sentence” in section 3 of the Act. The appellant sought the setting aside of the orders of the magistrate being that:
	



	
	the offence was proved; and
	
	
	the charge was dismissed without proceeding to a conviction.
	



	
	The abandonment of the prayer of relief seeking dismissal of the charge was appropriate because the magistrate had already dismissed the charge. I cannot determine on the basis of the material before me, why the prayer of relief seeking the imposition of a stay of the proceedings was abandoned. No argument has been put by the appellant to identify the basis on which the appellant could seek that relief in the second District Court appeal when it was expressly abandoned in the Supreme Court appeal.
	
	
	The first and second District Court appeals were also appeals against sentence by reference to the extended definition of “sentence”.
	
	
	Put simply, the appellant had no right of appeal unless it was against the sentence imposed in the Local Court.
	
	
	The effect of the orders of the Supreme Court was that leave to appeal was granted and the appeal against the sentence was dismissed. In other words, the appeal against sentence was dismissed and the appellant’s unfairness argument should be viewed in that context, namely that he was granted leave to prosecute the appeal on the grounds of appeal specified in the Summons. The arguments presented based on those grounds of appeal did not persuade the Supreme Court to set aside the magistrate’s orders.
	
	
	It was open to the appellant pursuant to section 53(1)(a) of the Act to seek the leave of the Supreme Court to include grounds of appeal based solely on questions of fact. The existence of that provision allowed for all of the appropriate issues to be determined by the Supreme Court at the one time, in the one appeal contemplated by the Act.
	
	
	The appellant did not seek to amend the grounds of the appeal to include a ground a solely based on a question of fact. There is no evidence before me upon which I could decide whether that was done as a result of the appellant’s instructions or because he was not advised to do so. The Supreme Court appeal could have examined the matters set out in [29(a)-(c)] above if the grounds of appeal in the Summons were amended and the Supreme Court had granted leave. There is no specific prohibition similar to section 18 of the Act, preventing the calling of fresh evidence in an appeal brought pursuant to section 53 of the Act and I presume (although it is unnecessary for me to decide) that the Supreme Court could have received fresh evidence, subject to the usual requirements for reception of fresh evidence on an appeal set out in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356 at [63].
	
	
	For the sake of completeness I should deal with two other matters arising from the appellant’s argument. First, the purpose of section 29 of the Act asserted by the appellant is not evident from its language or from a contextual reading of the Act. Accepting that the asserted purpose could be gleaned from a contextual reading of the Act (which I do not), even a clear purpose cannot override the words of the legislation: Certain Lloyds Underwriters v Cross (2012) 248 CLR 378. Second, the appellant’s argument is couched in terms of estoppel, which I assume is a reference to res judicata or issue estoppel. Neither of those concepts are raised in this argument because the right of appeal is statutory and the Court’s lack of jurisdiction arises from the appellant’s inability to demonstrate that he is entitled to appeal by reference to the terms of the statutory grant.
	
	
	The appellant was faced with a choice between an appeal to the Supreme Court or an appeal to the District Court against the sentence imposed. For the reasons given, the appellant could not pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court and an appeal to the District Court, except in the limited circumstances set out in section 29(2) of the Act which do not apply in this case.
	
	
	For these additional reasons, the second District Court appeal may not be made.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the reasons expressed, the argument before me on behalf of the appellant was manifestly hopeless. Regrettably, the legal representatives of the appellant did not exercise the forensic judgement expected of them by the Court to prevent it from proceeding.
	


Orders


	
	The proper order is that:
	



	
	The second District Court appeal lodged on 27 April 2015 is struck out as incompetent.

2702619,R v MILLER [2015] NSWDC 380,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: William Thomas Joseph Miller today appears for sentence in relation to an offence that he committed on 7 December 2014 in contravention of Commonwealth law.
	
	
	The offence that he committed, shortly stated, was an offence of importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug on 7 December 2014 at Sydney, an offence for which he was arrested and he has remained in custody since the date of his arrest. The border controlled drug was 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, as it is referred to in the facts and the charge particulars, otherwise known as MDMA.
	
	
	It goes without saying importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug attracts significant penalties. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 7,500 penalty units.
	
	
	The prisoner is now aged 30 and was thus 29 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence, having been born on 31 May 1985.
	
	
	It should be said from the outset that by and large the facts, save for one matter and the subjective circumstances of the prisoner and the general legal principles to be applied are essentially not in dispute.
	
	
	Dealing with the facts of the matter and the character of the offending I am required, I say from the outset, of course, to sentence the prisoner in accordance with Part 1B Crimes Act (Cth) 1914.
	
	
	Particularly I am to have regard to s 16A, amongst the other provisions within the Part. I am required to have regard to imposing a sentence or making an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. The learned counsel representing the Commonwealth Director’s interests, professionally in this matter, has drawn my attention to long standing authorities such as El Karhani, which reflects upon the fact that the sentencing the offenders for breaches of Commonwealth law requires consideration, notwithstanding no express reference to it in s 16A, of general deterrence as a relevant matter. Clearly that must be so in a case of this seriousness, particularly relating to border-controlled drugs.
	
	
	I will come back to the detail of the Crown’s submissions and the defence submissions as they touch upon these various matters, but I am required, as I understand the matter, by reference to s 16A(2) on the facts of this case to have regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence, the degree to which the prisoner has shown contrition for the offence, the fact that the prisoner has pleaded guilty, that fact, the degree to which he has cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence, the deterrent effect that any sentence or order may have on the prisoner, the need to ensure that the prisoner his adequately punished for the offence, his character, antecedents, age, means, physical and mental condition, his prospects of rehabilitation, the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on his family. He has a mother who is somewhat dependent upon him, but she could not reasonably categorised on the evidence available to me as a “dependant” in the strict sense.
	
	
	Those matters will be taken into account and will be referred to in my reference to the evidence. But I also note by reference to s 16A(2) that other matters I take into account, although they require no further explanation, are there are no other offences required to be taken into account, that the offence does not form part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of a similar character, there is no relevant victim of the offences committed by the prisoner and although potential harm would be done to the community by the importation of the relevant border-controlled drug there was no injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence. I am also required to note that the prisoner has not failed to comply with any particular obligation cast upon him, although it is not a critical matter in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The prisoner, as I understand it, is a native of London. He is a British citizen and he came to Australia on 7 December via Dubai, carrying a British passport and possessing an electronic tourist visa. The facts set out the circumstances of his entry to the country and the fact that he, filled in an Incoming Passenger Card (IPC) which had material untruths in them.
	
	
	He told the Customs officials that he was an ‘event planner’, that he was intending to visit friends or relatives, that he was staying at the Meriton at Bondi, that he had no prior criminal convictions and that he was not bringing into the country any relevant prohibited item, particularly “illicit drugs”. He also indicated that the bags that were with him were his own bags and he had packed his own bags. A cursory search of one bag, a black soft carry-on bag as it is described, was undertaken which located a book within which was a clip seal bag containing a small amount of white powder. The prisoner initially said that he did not know what it was. As I would understand it, it was the remnants of a drug that he had ingested at some time during the trip. I point out that that particular powder was tested to destruction, but no positive results were obtained. He said he did not know where the powder came from. It could have belonged to someone that he lived with and he did not know what the powder was. The finding of the powder, of course, aroused suspicions. The prisoner asked to be moved to a private room and, as was pointed out in the course of his evidence this was the point at which he realised that he was to be searched and he was prepared to volunteer the information in privacy that he was, in fact, carrying something on him that he should not have, other than the clip seal bag to which I referred.
	
	
	A few minutes after he asked to be taken to a private room he said that something was in his bag “I’m pretty sure I know what it is”. The prisoner was cautioned. A drug detection dog was brought into action, indicating a positive reaction to the contents of the prisoner’s baggage and a short time later the prisoner went to a room where he was interviewed by the use of an electronic recording device, and I have seen a transcript of that device’s recording. The prisoner indicated that he wished to speak to a legal practitioner, he would like to obtain legal advice, which is fair enough. But in the course of the conversations he had with the Customs officers he made a number of admissions after being cautioned. He admitted that he was carrying a “parcel” that he was asked to bring to Australia. He said that he believed that it was ketamine inside a neck pillow, and that he had been asked by a man called Andre to bring it into the country. He indicated that he was to be picked up by someone outside the airport and that was the reason that he had no money or phone. It was the fact that he revealed the person he understood that was to meet him at the airport was a person called “Dave” and that he, the prisoner, had about $100 in his possession.
	
	
	Further enquiries ultimately revealed that the neck pillow to which I referred within his baggage contained dark shadows, which subsequently were identified to be four wrapped packages containing the border controlled drug the subject of the charge. The prisoner was subsequently further spoken to by Australian Federal Police and cautioned. He sought to obtain legal advice and consular assistance. He admitted consuming drugs on the flight to Dubai from London.
	
	
	The neck pillow was examined and ultimately an off-white crystalline substance was removed from within the packages weighing a gross weight of 1.9837 kilograms or 1,983.7 grams. It was found to have a purity based upon the usual procedures of 69% and the total pure weight is calculated to be 1.3687 kilograms, or 1,368.7 grams. The facts state that the wholesale value of the MDMA imported is estimated to be between $81,150 and $135,240 and the “estimated street value” of the MDMA is estimated to be between $405,750 and approximately $676,000. Obviously what the prisoner brought into the country was a valuable commodity.
	
	
	With regard to the objective facts I bear in mind the information provided by the Crown as to what constitutes for the relevant purposes a commercial quantity of the border-controlled drug MDMA at law.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the evidence of the matter, including the evidence of the prisoner given during the course of the prisoner’s sentence proceedings and, of course, the facts provided by the Crown, it is clear that the prisoner was the importer of the border-controlled drugs. I am ultimately satisfied that he was acting as a courier on behalf of others at the request or direction of others, about whom I will speak shortly. The critical issue in sentencing the prisoner, having regard to all the evidence available to me, was whether the prisoner acted under what has been described in submission and in recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal as “non-exculpatory duress” a topic that was considered and discussed by his Honour Johnson J in the case of Tiknius v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA215. Particularly I have regard to the judgment at [30]-[54].
	
	
	In relation to this issue the prisoner, as I said, gave evidence that has to be considered on the basis of the facts as established from the Crown’s statement of facts and in that regard I bear in mind, as was raised with the prisoner in the course of the cross-examination of him, the fact that he did not raise any issue of “duress” when he did exercise his right to speak, as recorded in the taped conversation with Customs officers when he was spoken to in the private room. Tiknius is authority for the proposition that non-exculpatory duress is a relevant matter in a sentencing exercise under the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Tiknius was a case concerned with the importation of border-controlled drugs. Mr Tiknius was a person who gave evidence of various threats made against him and members of his family in his native country of Lithuania. Johnson J, on considering the relevant Commonwealth provisions, concluded that even where duress had not been made out as a defence to the charge, in sentencing it was a relevant matter to take into account, expressed as “non-exculpatory duress”.
	
	
	Amongst a number of observations, Johnson J said that it would be necessary for the sentencing judge to make factual findings as part of the assessment of whether this factor assists a prisoner on sentence, and if so to what extent. He analysed the character of non-exculpatory duress and he pointed out quite properly that there are a large number of cases where an offender claims on sentence that his or her involvement in a drug importation or supply offence was a product of threats to him or herself and/or his or her family, with threats sometimes coupled with the demands by those making the threats that the involvement in the importation can lead to the discharge of an existing debt. He said quite obviously that whether that is accepted depends on all the facts of a particular case. He pointed out quite properly that courts approach such claims with a significant degree of circumspection. He noted that such claims can be easily made concerning the alleged conduct of persons who are not amenable to justice in this country who had applied the pressure allegedly to an offender. The verification, of course, of these matters can be difficult one way or the other. He pointed to the need for careful and close assessment of the evidence and he also said that even when non exculpatory duress had been made out general deterrence will have a role to play. In fact, greater weight may need to be given to general deterrence, notwithstanding the existence of this factor, to discourage others from succumbing to these pressures. I have noted everything that his Honour said and particularly am aware of the circumspection that one must exercise in this situation.
	
	
	I have had, without having counted them, at least three such claims in this Court in the last 6 months or so. Two Chinese importers of drugs, or persons involved with the importations of drugs, and a Mexican American man who brought cocaine into the country, or methylamphetamine I cannot remember now, under what he claimed were threats made to him.
	
	
	Coming back to the facts of this case. The prisoner gave evidence of having worked as a roofer or a roofing contractor for a number of years, and I have taken into account his general evidence of his background and his involvement and industry in that trade since the age of about 15. He had, I would just point out by way of background, worked with his purported father, a person he discovered at the age of about 12 was, in fact, not his father, but his stepfather, if I might call him that. This person had died in a scuba diving accident with the prisoner was 18 or 19, and he, having worked at that stage two or three years with that man, had to try and continue that business with limited success. In any event he had just finished a contract, he said, in mid-2014 and was able to obtain a payment in some form of lump sum in the order £5,500. He said he lent £2,300 to a friend, who ultimately reneged on the debt and by about November 2014, perhaps October, discovered that he was in debt to a man that he had nominated as ‘Andre’ who had been associated with him over a period of about nine years and had from time to time supplied him recreational drugs for his personal use. The debt was made up of £400 in gambling debts from three gambling sessions with Andre and some other people and £1,200 for drugs that he purchased for himself. He had been able to, if I might use the expression, ‘tick-up’, without having to pay anything previously when dealing with Andre to obtain drugs. He had not incurred any debts greater than two or three hundred pounds. He found himself in the position, having not worked for a number of months, although part of that time being in Australia on a previous trip, not able to pay the money that had been said to be owed to this man Andre. He understood that Andre knew that he had been to Australia, as emerged in cross-examination, two times between 2013 and 2014 and Andre suggested that he would take ‘drugs’ to Australia on his behalf.
	
	
	He was threatened initially by Andre in a conversation relating to both the debt and the proposition that he would take drugs to Australia. Then on another occasion he was assaulted by Andre, being grabbed by the neck and pushed to the ground and he claimed kicked in the body. For him, based upon Andre’s attitude, the fact that he was indebted to Andre and he had no means of clearing the debt, although it is not fully explained how he could not return to roofing work, the message was clear. After the ‘kicking’, which occurred apparently somewhere near his home, there was no further threat, because by that stage he agreed to undertake what Andre had proposed. There had been an implicit threat that he took to be a threat to his mother and possibly his half-brother, that Andre said that he knew where his family lived. He said fearing for the safety of his mother and his brother he agreed to the proposal, although he thought the drugs were Ketamine, consistent with what he told the Customs officers. As I understand the assault upon him that occurred about two weeks or slightly more before he flew top Australia.
	
	
	A business class ticket was purchased for him to fly to Australia via Dubai and an economy class ticket was booked for the flight back. Initially booked to occur approximately 12 days after he arrived. He was only given though $300 in spending money. Presumably he was paid that money in pounds and he changed that money, as I remember his evidence not having a transcript of it, at London Airport. By the time he arrived in Australia he had about $100 left over, and he had purchased some duty free items in Australia as he passed through the duty free shops, as I would understand his evidence, presumably to make himself look less conspicuous. He understood by doing all this his debt to Andre would be forgiven.
	
	
	The day he left London he was photographed in the clothes that he would be wearing on the flight and given the neck pillow which held the relevant drug. As I said, he had some small amount of drug in his possession which he ingested on the flight to Dubai.
	
	
	I am not favoured with any evidence as to what an equivalent volume of the drug ketamine would be worth. In other words if it was ketamine would it be worthwhile paying a business class fare and an economy class fare and forgiving a £1600 debt to make the trip. Ultimately, I have no reason to disbelieve the prisoner’s belief that what he was carrying was ketamine. It was not a matter of any discussion by either of the parties in the presentation of their respective cases. The prisoner said that in fact he was not going to stay in Australia for 12 days. He hoped to return to Britain a day or two after his arrival, and that is consistent with his lack of means of support when he arrived in Australia. He certainly did not agree that he was in Australia for some paid holiday.
	
	
	In some respects he was an unlikely drug courier. For a start he had a number of findings of guilt or convictions in relation to drug possession in Britain, confirmed in a letter from Manchester Interpol which I have just recently discussed with the learned Crown Prosecutor and the defence counsel. As I would understand it he was charged with possession of a controlled drug on 3 February 2008. It is called a class A drug and described as MDMA. He was charged on 25 July 2008 with possession of a class A drug and a class C drug and he was also charged on 22 June 2011 with possession of a class B drug, being cannabis, all being offences of a minor nature, obviously dealt with without any term of imprisonment being imposed. These convictions reveal him to be a user of particular drugs, but they do not, in my view, suggest that he, the prisoner, is a drug supplier within Great Britain. He did not declare these convictions, if I might call them that, when he entered Australia. He obviously ran the risk of detection if local screening methods were able to pick up from his passport details any recorded convictions in his home country. Perhaps, although I do not know this, his failure to declare the convictions is what attracted Custom’s interest in the first place.
	
	
	Further, he also had in his possession and easily found, a small amount of white powder which would immediately arouse suspicion and inevitably lead to a thorough search of his baggage one would have thought. On might have thought if one was importing into this country a significant quantity of drugs as he did it was most unwise to be carrying a small amount of a drug that could easily detected with a cursory search of his baggage.
	
	
	He had no mobile phone, as I previously mentioned, and he had little or no visible means of support on his arrival in Australia, being entirely dependent on another person who he did not know.
	
	
	I have taken into account what arose in cross-examination about his prior trips to Australia, as I understand it in July 2013 and July 2014. I have taken into account the evidence given by the prisoner on cross-examination of a number of trips to the island of Ibiza, which is well known as a type of party island, particularly for British citizens. One of those trips was revealed to be an overnight trip, although he volunteered in cross-examination, and it was not led from him in-chief, that he had attended upon that island overnight in order to bring a friend back from Ibiza who had died. He denied that those trips were related to drug activity. Based upon the evidence he gave notwithstanding the propositions he accepted from the cross-examination I could not conclude from this history of travel that the prisoner is a professional drug courier or that those trips have anything to do with drug importation. There is a suspicion about these matters, of course, but ultimately I could not conclude adverse to the prisoner some inference damaging to his credibility or damaging in the assessment of the objective facts.
	
	
	There is evidence in the references he has produced from one person that of the prisoner being groomed as a “event planner”, which I take to be some form of “party planner” and the prisoner’s connection with Ibiza in that capacity. It does not require much imagination to understand that if one is attending parties in Ibiza that a drug such as MDMA might be consumed.
	
	
	Also the prisoner produced a reference from a friend who lives in Australia and has lived here for some time, who he had encouraged to come to Australia to further her career. That matter is a relevant matter to the assessment of his previous trip to Australia.
	
	
	He was also pressed by the Crown as to his lack of knowledge of Andre’s surname, his claim of injury from the assault upon Andre which he did not declare to customs officers nor claim any duress on the part of Andre. I have taken all the relevant matters that emerge from the evidence and the submissions on this topic. I have come to the conclusion on balance in his failure that he did commit the offence under a direct infliction of force and the threat of injury to himself and implied or in direct threat of harm to his family if he did not comply with a request to import drugs. I am prepared to accept that he had a significant drug debt although as his lawyers no doubt would have told him, and as the Crown and his lawyers well know, there is time honoured authority in Australia that simply to commit a serious crime to have a significant debt forgiven such as a gambling or a drug debt is not a matter in mitigation. It needs to be seen for what it is, a financial benefit provided albeit to clear past indebtedness.
	
	
	However, even accepting his account in general terms that he did not enter into this agreement in a considered way for commercial gain only, the use of violence and the threat or fear of further violence was not as extreme as other matters that the courts see and certainly of not such a character in its context to render him incapable of seeking redress either through the authorities in Great Britain or, to my mind more reasonably, to the authorities in Australia. The true character of his milieu, if I might call it, in London is not revealed by him. I cannot criticise him for that. He said he had contact with this purportedly “violent drug dealer” for some period of time and was not adverse to having a relationship with him. Whether he regularly comes in contact with drug dealers or violent people is something about which I could only speculate. It appeared to me from his evidence that his contact with Andre was a commonplace experience for him. But it ordinarily may not be a commonplace experience for law-abiding citizens of reasonable firmness who respect the laws of Great Britain, and are capable of reporting threats or assaults and can resist the temptation to import prohibited drugs, if I might call them that, into this country or other countries.
	
	
	The prisoner I am quite satisfied on his own version of events had no doubt that he was performing an illegal act and this was exemplified by his conduct on entering Australia and falsifying the information he provided to the authorities. He also knew that he was in a great deal of trouble as the searches of his baggage became more intense, and recognising this and I take this into account to his credit rather than stonewall he did exhibit a limited degree of co-operation. I accept in terms of revealing relevant information he did not have a great deal of opportunity to reflect upon how much information he could give at that particular time. Of course his co-operation is not of the type that warrants any form of discount, but I note his willingness to assist the authorities. Of course they had him ‘over a barrel’. They could search him ultimately whether he consented or not.
	
	
	If the prisoner at some point felt that he was bound by some form of code of honour in not giving up his supplier, or anybody else for that matter, he did not say that that was so.
	
	
	I have taken into account not only the matters that I have adverted to, but I have also taken into account in assessing this issue matters that seem to me to be unsatisfactorily answered by the prisoner. He told me that he did not know Andre’s family name. I cannot accept that assertion assuming that Andre’s first name is correct. If the prisoner in open court can reveal the threats of violence it is difficult to understand why the full name of his recruiter was not disclosed save for the explanation that the prisoner refused to do so perhaps out of fear of consequences. He may still be fearful of repercussions on his return to Great Britain or he may be deliberately covering up for the recruiter. Either way however I cannot accept his account that he did not know the family name or the surname of a person with whom he had contact over nine years. He did not need Andre to tell him. He could have found it out from other people or made inquiries about, and of course it just seems ridiculous that he should suggest that he would travel all the way to Australia to commit a serious crime on behalf of this person without knowing this person’s surname. That having been said, I otherwise found him to be a reasonably impressive witness and I am prepared to accept his evidence about his personal circumstances, his background and the matter relating to non-exculpatory duress that I have found in his favour.
	
	
	If I might just briefly refer to Tiknius the learned sentencing judge in that matter did not give recognition to the duress that she found as a fact had been established on the evidence. Mr Tiknius was a man who came from Lithuania. One of his recruiters was armed with a firearm. The other person, Mr Tiknius believed as the Crown found it, had a corrupt relationship with Lithuanian police. Tiknius had been directly threatened with death. He had a gun pointed to his head and been told his girlfriend would be raped. He was specifically told not to go to the police. Of course it is quite clear when one looks at the evidence of Mr Miller, the threats made to the prisoner were nowhere near as extreme as this, and the implied threat to his family was nowhere near as specific as the threat made to Mr Tiknius’ girlfriend. As I understand his evidence there was no specific warning about not going to the authorities although clearly that would have been implicit in what had occurred. He said he was beaten up. Accepting that for the moment, he did not, it would seem, require any substantial medical treatment in Great Britain. He has not produced any evidence in that regard. He was well enough to travel to Australia on a lengthy international flight and made no real complaint about injury when arrested. Although I am told that he did complain about injury when in Corrective Services custody.
	
	
	In Tiknius an examination of the matter ultimately led the Court of Criminal Appeal to conclude that there should be a reduction of the principal sentence for the most serious offence from ten years imprisonment taking into account all relevant matters to eight years imprisonment. In relation to the less serious matter there was a reduction of one year, from six years to five years imprisonment. The total sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge at first instance was 11 years. That was reduced as I understand the judgment in Tiknius to nine years in recognition of all the matters her Honour found and the mitigating characteristic of non-exculpatory duress. There was a specific submission made by the learned senior counsel for this prisoner, the subtlety of which I must confess I missed at the time, that the case of Tiknius served a comparative sentencing purpose. Initially I understood that to be a submission about the total sentence imposed. But I now understand the submission to be that that judgment, and the treatment of the matters before the court in material terms, provided some measure of the extent of mitigation afforded to non-exculpatory duress in that matter.
	
	
	I appreciate of course in any comparative sentencing exercise one should not be fixated on one case. In RCW (No 2), a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal from within the last couple of years a Judge of my Court was criticised for in dealing with comparative cases fixating, if that is the correct expression, on only one case to provide some measure of the appropriate sentence in the case at bar. However decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal obviously provide guidance and assistance in structuring sentencing discretion. I will come back to the issue of comparative sentencing in a more general sense when I deal with matters raised in the Crown’s submissions. But having regard to the decision in Tiknius and having regard to my decision to recognise on balance the existence of non-exculpatory duress as a mitigating factor, taking into account all else said by Johnson J, I have had regard to Tiknius as providing some general indication of the way in which that mitigation can work. However, of course, I am required in sentencing to apply what are called ‘Markarian’ principles from the decision of the High Court in 2005, such as that of Justice McHugh, and thus ‘instinctively’ or ‘intuitively’ synthesise all relevant matters. This is not a matter that calls for a discrete recognition of that mitigation.
	
	
	The prisoner’s evidence about his circumstances in part I have referred to and details of his background and his upbringing are cited in the report of Mr Borenstein, the clinical psychologist who prepared a report in relation to this prisoner dated 6 June 2015. I have taken into account that history the prisoner adopted in his evidence and gave some specific details about it. He was not required to go into greater detail given his adoption of the detail of his background. I accept the prisoner was greatly affected by learning of the true identity of his stepfather as not his real father. This had an effect upon his education, but ultimately he reconciled with his stepfather and went into business with him as I have earlier pointed out. He had some difficulties after his stepfather’s death when he was 18 or 19. I am prepared to accept he has been a good worker and has a strong work ethic. He has been a user of, what we would call in New South Wales, prohibited drugs over a period of time. He has been treated with anti-depressant medication for the treatment of symptoms of depression in March 2013 and January 2014. The clinical presentation to the psychologist was of a person with some ‘affective symptoms’ but there was no psychotic or other mental disturbance.
	
	
	It should be pointed out that his counsel did not submit to this court that there was an existing mental illness or mental disability which was causally related to the offending which would warrant consideration of those various principles that are set out for example in the decision of Justice McClellan CJ at CL in the decision of DPP v De La Rosa, [2010] NSWCCA 194, at [177-178]. But De La Rosa does have significance in this case for another reason. The prisoner’s life in London over 2013 and 2014 had led to some as I said depressive symptoms requiring some medication. The prisoner is not receiving any psychiatric treatment in custody nor does he need it. He is a person who is endeavouring as he said in his evidence to make the best of a bad situation by getting fit and looking after himself, keeping a low profile and staying out of trouble.
	
	
	His use of MDMA and cocaine as referred to in the report as having an effect upon him not in a positive way highlights the damage that drugs can do to people. The psychologist reflects upon his risks of relapsing into depressive episodes which I have taken into account, but I bear in mind his current stable condition there is no suggestion that his conditions in custody are affected at all by any past symptoms he has suffered. He needs to be aware of the risk of recurrent depressive episodes. He requires some counselling and assistance which I have taken into account in respect of his sentence and the fixing of the non-parole period. He has also produced a number of references from family members, family friends and other people that know him either in business or personally. What emerges from this material is consistent with the account he gave of his circumstances of offending. He is a loyal person, particularly loyal to his mother for whom he feels very protective bearing in mind her former partner had died some 12 years ago. He has been responsible for her financially. He has been responsible for his half brother as well and tried to support his family as best he can. He is regarded as a friendly man who is loyal and supportive of his friends.
	
	
	He plays a role at his local community, apparently assisting at a community centre particularly in the ‘sweet science’ of boxing. He is also regarded as honest and trustworthy in his business dealings and is regarded as an industrious and skilled roofer. Some of the referees I hasten to say do not appear to have much knowledge of some aspects of his background. One referee referred to this matter with which I am concerned is his “first offence” and having a “clear record”. But the offending that I have discussed earlier really just provides some context for understanding how the prisoner could come to be involved with people responsible for planning this particular importation.
	
	
	I have referred to the reference from the event planner who also speaks of his good character and his positive dealings with that person. A number of references reflect upon his remorse for his actions both from family members, including his mother and family friends. A number of people refer to their shock and dismay at him being charged in relation to such a serious offence. Certainly this is by far the most serious offence that he has committed and many express the hope of leniency being extended to him. I have taken all that evidentiary material into account as I have earlier indicated.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions that were made by the parties the Crown provided, as is always the case in Commonwealth matters, very extensive written submissions and the learned Mr Sutherland SC appearing for the prisoner in his oral submissions concentrated primarily on the issues that arose from the evidence. Naturally I am required to have regard to the maximum penalty and assess the criminality in the context of the maximum penalty as a yardstick for the appropriate sentence. I am required to give full recognition for the time that the prisoner has spent in custody and I will do that by commencing the sentence from 7 December 2014. As I have earlier pointed out I am required to take into account Part 1B of the Act. I have dealt with the nature and circumstances of the offence and I have taken into account in that regard the value of the prohibited drug as it is estimated in the facts. It is clear that this is a case for financial gain but certainly I could not conclude that the prisoner was to share substantially any profit that could be made from his endeavour, and I have already identified what financial gain he was to receive. I have dealt with the issue of non-exculpatory duress and I accept in recognising that factor and all the other factors the need for an element of general deterrence in the sentencing that I undertake at the moment.
	
	
	There are a number of matters arising in the Crown’s written submissions that I need to particularly address. Firstly, in respect of showing contrition in relation to the matter I am prepared to accept the prisoner is contrite. There was some element of contribution in his co-operation with the investigators to the extent that he did co-operate. There is evidence of contrition in his plea of guilty and he gave evidence of his contrition before me. I accept on balance that he established that he has relevantly shown contrition for the offence. With regard to the plea of guilty I am required to recognise that and am entitled to consider a discount to recognise aspects of that plea of guilty. I may do so if it demonstrates mitigation in the character of genuine remorse, acceptance of responsibility or a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I am satisfied of those matters. I am mindful of the detail and written submissions made by the Crown about this matter. I am mindful of course that the court is not to recognise by any discount the ‘utilitarian benefit’ of the plea of guilty. It is fairly said, as the Crown points out in that latter regard, that the Crown case against the prisoner was overwhelming. That having been said I have determined that I should grant the prisoner, consistent with many authorities of the Court of Criminal Appeal, including of course De La Rosa which I will come back to in a moment, that I should afford the prisoner a 25% discount to recognise his remorse, acceptance of responsibility and his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I have noted the history of the matter from the Crown’s written submissions. The prisoner pleaded guilty approximately three months after his arrest at the Local Court and was committed for sentence. With regard to co-operation I have already noted that of course there is no discount that he is entitled to and it has not been sought.
	
	
	With regard his antecedents and background I have already summarised the evidence in relation to that including his criminal antecedents. The Crown refers to his past findings of guilt as I would describe them in 2008 and 2011 as being matters relevant to ensuring that he is adequately punished, which is correct, and also as matters to be considered in assessing the deterrent effect of any order that I make upon him. I do take those findings of guilt into account in that respect but they, to my mind, are minor matters. This is not a case where there is an extra element of personal or specific deterrence required because the prisoner has by his previous conduct exhibited a “disregard” from a law that is meaningful or relevant to this sentencing exercise. He has findings of guilt for drug offences but very minor matters as the records reveal, such as they are. The criminal history really provides more assistance to the court in providing an explanation as to how he became recruited rather than reflecting upon the need for greater weight to be given in this particular case to specific deterrence.
	
	
	But having said that of course I must impose a sentence that is a personal deterrent to the prisoner and I believe that a substantial term of imprisonment in Australia will be a deterrent to him. As I have already pointed out I have taken into account the report of the psychologist. I have accepted that the prisoner has come from a disadvantaged background and has had a number of burdens to overcome in his life. I accept that he is a loyal person to his family which is one of the reasons he succumbed to this threat from his recruiter. His drug addiction naturally is not a mitigating factor and the matters that arise from Henry v R particularly those discussed by Justice Wood at [273], (see R v Henry and Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346) are not of significance in this particular case. I am also mindful of the observations of Justice Latham in the decision of Le [2006] NSWCCA 136, particularly at [32].
	
	
	I have concluded the prisoner has positive prospects of rehabilitation. So far as the effect upon his family of any penalty I impose I am mindful of some dependency upon him by his mother but there is not enough evidence for me to conclude any exceptional or special circumstances arise from that relationship. The prisoner has supported his mother and half brother but I point out from the facts available to me that he was in no real position to assist them materially from the time that he ceased work in the middle of 2014 until he came to Australia. But the matters arising from the evidence of the prisoner and the references are properly, as the Crown points out and it is conceded by Mr Sutherland, matters in the general mix of subjective factors as are of course the opinions of Mr Borenstein.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to s 17A of the Act. No other sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate in this matter and I am also required of fixing a term of imprisonment of in excess of three years to impose a non-parole period and properly backdate the sentence which I will do.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions of Mr Sutherland I humbly state at this point that I believe that I have dealt with the substance of them in my treatment of the issues that have arisen from the evidence. The primary matter the subject of discussion in submission from the learned Senior Counsel was directed at the relevance of ‘non-exculpatory duress’.
	
	
	With regard to comparative sentencing I am appreciative of the fact that comparative sentencing can be of assistance to a court, certainly for this court decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal are of great value in assisting us to reach a sentence that falls within an appropriate range for a particular type of offending. Certainly comparative sentencing is a more useful mechanism for checking where a particular sentence should lie having regard to all the circumstances of the case than statistics.
	
	
	The Crown provided a ‘schedule’ which included about five, six cases from different states of the Commonwealth outside of New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland and two decisions of the District Court, and I appreciate the industry of the learned Crown. In fairness to myself I would have sentenced 10, 12 drug importers this year in various ways and in the last 15 years no doubt I would imagine well over a hundred. But I do not rely on my own judgment to check the correctness of any decision I have reached. In relation to the issue of comparative sentencing I raised with the learned Crown the issue of why there was no reference to the judgment of the learned Chief Judge at Common Law in De La Rosa. I am constantly finding in Commonwealth sentencing matters that the learned Chief Judge at Common Law’s analysis of a far greater range of comparative sentences than provided to me by the Commonwealth Crown is not referred to in the material provided by the Crown.
	
	
	Be that as it may I have regard to the material provided by the Crown and the various cases therein cited. I have also had regard to the analysis undertaken by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law in the context of his observations about “the importance of consistency in sentencing”. And specifically I note what his Honour said at [193]-[224]. His Honour undertook an exhaustive analysis of a range of authorities both within New South Wales and interstate in an endeavour to ascertain, in the context of the case at bar which was concerned with the importation of cocaine, ranges of penalty for particular categories of offending. He identified what he described as four groups of offenders that might be categorised by reference to matters which need to be taken into account as they are here. Such as the pure weight of the relevant prohibited drug, the role of the offender, the antecedents of the offender, and other matters that particularly pertain to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. In relation to his categorisation of offenders in the context of dealing with importation cases he identified four groups. He identified the fourth group, if I might call it this, as being those who have pleaded guilty, who were involved with quantities of drugs that ranged from one kilogram to 30 kilograms where offenders occupy roles variously described as instigators, overseers, collectors and couriers. Many offenders in this group had good antecedents and no prior convictions. The other groups that he identified usually were concerned with people more substantially involved in the organisation of the importations. He identified a range of sentencing between 6.25 years through to eight years. Acknowledging that there were varying discounts given for pleas of guilty. I have had regard to His Honour’s detailed analysis in conjunction with the analysis of the summaries of the cases provided by the learned Crown.
	
	
	As I say in the context of sentencing in this Court I could refer to a hundred or two hundred cases not of my own but of other judges that have been brought to my attention over recent years. Of course every case has to be decided on its own facts. There is no ‘Code of Hammurabi’ which identifies a precise sentence having regard to all relevant characteristics from a particular offender and a particular offence.
	
	
	Thus, having regard to the matters that were advanced by the parties and the matters I have identified in my reasons I have concluded ultimately that the sentence I should impose upon the prisoner with a discount that I have identified should be six years and six months to date from 7 December 2014. I cannot of course direct the prisoner be released to parole that will be a matter for the Commonwealth authorities in conjunction with the New South Wales authority in the usual way.
	
	
	Are there any other matters Madam Crown from your perspective?
	
	
	ALLES: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any other matters from your perspective Mr Dib?
	
	
	DIB: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Could you stand up please Mr Miller. In relation to the offence to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment. It can be expressed in various ways but I will express it this way for you, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and six months. That will date from 7 December 2014. That sentence will expire on 6 June 2021 on my calculation. The non-parole period I fix is three years and seven months. That will commence on 7 December 2014 and will expire on 6 July 2018. Thus on 6 July 2018 you will be eligible for parole. In fixing the non-parole period I have taken into account your prospects of rehabilitation but in light of your drug use I have taken into account the matters that are relevant for the assessment of a non-parole period as discussed in decision of the High Court such as Bugmy, Power and the like as well as many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. I particularly had regard to the more recent decision in this regard of Hili and Jones, a case the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions referred to in the written submissions.
	
	
	But of course the reality in your case is that you will be released to parole to be deported to Great Britain. But I should tell you under Australian law that does not deny you the benefit of the matters that need to be taken into account in fixing a non-parole period. The fact that you won’t be the subject of parole supervision creates it must be fairly said, some form of fiction. But it is well entrenched in our law that you should receive the same benefit and consideration of those matters as has to be taken into account for someone who would be released into the Australian community and subject to parole supervision. Just take a seat.
	
	
	One last matter I should point out, I have taken into account, although it was not discussed at all, the prisoner will serve his sentence in Australia and will be serving his sentence of course some distance from his family. Of course it is not a matter to be ignored but on the other hand people from overseas who commit serious crimes in our country, or come to our country to commit crimes, can expect nothing else if detected, than to serve terms of imprisonment separated from their family whilst they are in custody here.
	
	
	Mr Miller one last matter, as the Crown correctly pointed out in its written submissions, the Commonwealth Act requires me to explain the sentence.  I think I have done that to the best of my ability. But you will not be released to parole, subject to any rights of appeal you have or any rights of appeal the Crown have, until at least the 6 July 2018. Then it is a matter of discretion for the authorities. If you are of good behaviour in custody and the like you will be released in due course to parole I expect whatever the sentence ultimately is, but you will eventually be taken into immigration detention and then deported fairly promptly. Yes thank you, you are excused.

		07 March 2016",2015-10-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702620,R v Azar [2015] NSWSC 1486,"Judgment


	
	This matter is listed before the Court to determine the question of the accused’s fitness to be tried for the offence of murder.
	
	
	The accused was charged with that offence on 16 August 2013. He was subsequently committed to this Court to stand trial.
	
	
	The accused was arraigned before Johnson J on 7 August 2015. A fresh indictment was filed today, with the Court’s leave, to correct a technical error. The indictment charges that the accused, on or about 14 August 2013, at Granville in the State of New South Wales, murdered Basem Salameh.
	
	
	The issue of the accused’s fitness to be tried for the offence having been raised by the accused’s legal representatives, the Court proceeded to hear evidence on that subject pursuant to s 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	


The Evidence

Events Around the Time of the Alleged Offence


	
	Made available to the Court for the purposes of the fitness inquiry was a copy of the Crown Case Statement in relation to the charge against the accused. I do not propose to set out the details of the allegations against the accused, except where it is necessary to do so in relation to the question of fitness.
	
	
	Very broadly, the accused is alleged to have participated with two others in the murder of a man known to them, at an apartment in Granville on the night of 13 August 2013, or into the early hours of the following morning. The death of Bassam Salameh involved considerable violence.
	
	
	The accused was arrested by police on 16 August 2013 and interviewed. A transcript of the interview between the accused and investigating police of that day is in evidence as Exhibit B1. During the interview the accused denied any involvement in the deceased’s murder. He was quite discursive throughout the interview, becoming agitated towards its end.
	
	
	After various forensic procedures were conducted the accused was allowed to leave.
	
	
	A second interview was conducted on 19 August 2013 (Ex. B2). During that interview the accused gave a detailed account of events surrounding the deceased’s death. His account was odd to say the least. In some significant regards, his claims were not borne out by the clinical findings of the forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased.
	
	
	After the accused was arrested statements were obtained from a number of family members, in evidence as Exs. C to G.
	
	
	The accused’s family had observed changes in the accused’s behaviour from 2011 or thereabouts, with what seems to have been a significant deterioration in his conduct. His family thought he may have been using the drug known as “ice”.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 13 August 2013 the accused’s mother saw her son walking down a street in Granville. She was distressed by his appearance, noting that he was dishevelled and seemed drug affected.
	
	
	The following evening, 14 August 2013, the accused returned to his family home in Granville. He was malodorous and dirty.
	
	
	The following day the accused became very aggressive towards his mother, accusing her of having stolen his money, and calling her “a fucking bitch” and “the devil”. He later began crying and saying “they” would kill him if he didn’t give them money. He was very agitated, and spoke of worshipping the devil and killing himself. Eventually he left the house.
	
	
	On 17 August 2013 the accused’s mother and other family members saw him in the street in Granville. The accused was distraught and gave a bizarre account of what had happened to the deceased and of his role in the events. He made references to being in danger from “them”, stating that they would kill him if he “snitched”.
	
	
	On 19 August 2013 the accused was arrested and charged by police. The second interview, referred to above, was conducted.
	
	
	On being entered into custody the accused was seen at various times by Justice Health staff. His behaviour was noted to be “erratic” but there does not appear to have been a formal diagnosis of psychosis (Ex. H). His behavioural issues were initially regarded as originating from the difficulties the accused had withdrawing from drugs.
	
	
	In the following months the accused’s conduct sparked some concerns with prison staff, and he was examined by medical staff. On 21 January 2014 the accused was noted to be unshaven with patches missing from his hair. There was marked psychomotor agitation and he appeared suspicious of those around him. He was having trouble sleeping. The accused reported hallucinations; he had been seeing the deceased walking around his cell. His speech was tangential and he gave inappropriate answers.
	
	
	On 22 January 2014 the accused was seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Hearps. The accused again reported hallucinations centred on the deceased. He was suspicious, with tangential thought and speech. Dr Hearps thought the accused had schizophreniform disorder evidenced by hallucinations and thought disorder. The accused was started on Olanzepine.
	
	
	On 29 January 2014 Dr Hearps saw the accused again. He reported some improvement. There was a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.
	
	
	Another psychiatrist who saw the accused in February 2014 thought he had pseudo-hallucinosis and post-traumatic spectrum disorder rather than schizophreniform disorder. The possibility of a brief reactive psychosis was raised. This possibility was later confirmed.
	
	
	Also in February 2014 the accused made threats of self-harm and of violence towards another prisoner.
	
	
	By October 2014 it was thought that the brief reactive psychosis had resolved although the accused remained illogical and tangential in expression. He continued to make occasional reports of hearing voices.
	
	
	Although the accused was not previously medically examined for a mental illness prior to his incarceration, such symptoms have been noted.
	
	
	The accused was admitted to Westmead Hospital emergency department on 4 April 2013, with self-inflicted injuries to his right hand. The hospital notes (Ex. J) record his irrational speech, and refer to suicidal ideation.
	


Evidence as to the Accused’s Current Mental State


	
	During the progression of the criminal charge through the Local Court the accused was represented by a solicitor. Senior Counsel was later briefed to appear for him.
	
	
	In July 2015 the accused withdrew instructions from his then representatives. Mr Peter Murphy, solicitor, was subsequently instructed to appear for the accused.
	
	
	Mr Murphy’s affidavit of 1 October 2015 (Ex. 1) was read before the Court.
	
	
	Mr Murphy saw the accused on a number of occasions after he was retained, and on each occasion he found the accused difficult to engage in meaningful conversation about the charge against him, and the accused frequently became aggressive, with his comments tangential. The accused made inapposite comments about hearing voices, and waiting for a number.
	
	
	Mr Murphy deposes that he has been unable to obtain any detailed or meaningful instructions from the accused in his various conferences with him.
	
	
	Mr Murphy retained Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, to examine the accused. In evidence is a report from Dr Allnutt of 28 September 2015 (Ex. 1.1). The doctor was briefed with relevant documentary material, and saw the accused personally.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt conducted a clinical evaluation of the accused via audio-visual link on 22 June 2015. After some difficulty in again gaining access to the accused, he examined him for a second time on 23 September 2015.
	
	
	Initially, the accused’s presentation was unremarkable. He reported a good appetite, good sleep patterns, and appropriate interest in activities. He denied having visions, or hearing voices. He did not seem to endorse persecutory thoughts.
	
	
	After some short time however, Dr Allnutt found the accused less appropriately responsive. Although he denied receiving messages from the television for example, he went on to comment about information about a quiz being received through the media. He told Dr Allnutt he was not allowed to say anything more about it.
	
	
	When the subject of his more unusual comments to Mr Murphy was raised, the accused claimed not to know or not to recall having made them. Dr Allnutt thought that the accused was unwilling to engage with him on this aspect of events.
	
	
	When Dr Allnutt asked questions of the accused directed to gauging his capacity to meet the Presser criteria (R v Presser [1958] VR 45) the answers given suggested, at the very least, an odd degree of disengagement from the criminal justice system in which the accused was entangled. He referred to lawyers as talking “too much shit” and the role of the prosecution as being “to fuck my life up”. The judge was there, he said, to send him to heaven or hell. The accused said that, as to providing his lawyer with instructions, he would “let him do what he wants”.
	
	
	After a time the accused became abusive and aggressive, and expressed considerable suspicion of both the doctor and his lawyers.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s opinion is that the accused manifests a chronic psychotic disorder, possibly a schizoaffective disorder. He regards paranoid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with secondary psychosis as a possible diagnosis. Given the accused’s history of drug use, a drug-induced psychosis may have persisted.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt thought that the accused was difficult to engage due to the active symptoms of mental illness. Whilst his initial presentation was belligerent and oppositional, the doctor concluded that he continues to manifest psychotic symptoms. Dr Allnutt discounted the possibility that the accused is malingering.
	
	
	Although Dr Allnutt thought that the accused has the capacity to meet many of the Presser criteria, he has concluded that he is unfit to be tried.
	
	
	Whilst the accused has the capacity to understand the charge against him, the general nature of the proceedings, the substantial effect of evidence adduced, and the ability to decide on his defence and plead to the charge, he does not have, in the doctor’s opinion, the uncompromised capacity to instruct his lawyers and to tell the court his version of relevant events.
	
	
	Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist, saw the accused on 29 September 2015 and 7 October 2015. He prepared a report, (misdated) 8 August 2015 (correctly 8 October 2015), admitted into evidence as Ex. A.
	
	
	The accused was agitated when seeing Dr Adams, and was both guarded and disengaged in conversation with him. He told Dr Adams, ""Maybe you need the light... I'll walk away from you ... you're full of darkness."" 
	
	
	He was distracted and, although he confirmed hearing voices, he was unwilling to discuss them to any great extent. He denied thought interference more generally, although he claimed to have visions from God.
	
	
	The accused became increasingly disengaged when interviewed by Dr Adams. He mumbled and occasionally appeared to be responding to hallucinatory phenomena. Dr Adams thought that the accused manifested features of thought disorder and that he professed views consistent with delusional beliefs. He seemed to experience hallucinations.
	
	
	Dr Adams questioned the accused to elucidate his understanding of the court process. The accused was unwilling to talk about the events surrounding the death of the deceased, or to discuss his plea. He gave an account of the meaning of the pleas of guilty and not guilty which, whilst rudimentary, was not incorrect.
	
	
	He had some understanding of the functions of some of the personnel in the Court room, but seemed confused about that of others. He claimed not to know the role of his own lawyer. He demonstrated a lack of understanding of the role of the jury, and of the concept of a challenge to a juror.
	
	
	Dr Adams concluded that the accused manifested symptoms of psychosis on examination, including likely hallucinatory phenomena, delusional beliefs and underlying persecutory ideation. He considered that the accused’s psychotic symptoms are most likely to be indicative of a schizophrenic illness or a schizoaffective disorder, being a combination of psychosis and a mood disorder. There is also, in his view, the possibility of a substance abuse disorder.
	
	
	Dr Adams was concerned by the accused’s mental state, and in particular his disordered thought processes, guarded and suspicious manner, agitation, hallucinatory phenomena, likely delusional beliefs, and his unwillingness to engage in the assessment process. He was of the opinion that the accused lacked the capacity to follow the court processes, to give a version of events, and to instruct his legal representatives. He concluded that he did not satisfy the Presser criteria to a minimum standard.
	
	
	Although Dr Adams found it difficult to predict whether the accused would become fit within twelve months, he thought it was possible that, with proper medical treatment, the accused could be considered fit in that period.
	


Consideration


	
	Both doctors referred to the “Presser criteria” and those criteria are well established. They derive from the Victorian decision of R v Presser [1958] VR 45, as affirmed in Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 245. To be fit to be tried, the accused needs,
	


“... be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in Court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand all the formalities. He needs to be able to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the Court what it is. He need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence: but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.”


	
	There is unanimity between the doctors who have examined the accused for the purposes of these proceedings that he does not have the capacity to meet these criteria, and is not presently fit to be tried.
	
	
	Section 12 of the Act provides that an inquiry into an accused person’s fitness is to be conducted in a non-adversarial manner, and the hearing has proceeded in that way. Indeed, as with Drs Allnutt and Adams, there is unanimity between senior counsel for the Crown and senior counsel for the accused that the evidence supports a conclusion that the accused is not presently fit.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence that the accused has been exhibiting behavioural deterioration for some years, with his family observing those changes around three years prior to the date of the commission of the alleged offence. His deterioration is likely to correspond with his use of illicit drugs, including the very dangerous form of amphetamine known as “ice”.
	
	
	Some of the things said to police in the days following the death of the deceased are bizarre to say the least, and may of themselves suggest the presence of mental illness.
	
	
	The accused’s presentation on admission into custody was sufficiently odd that it was noticed, and the accused was examined. Although the diagnosis from psychiatrists and other doctors who saw the accused through Justice Health has not been always consistent, there is enough in the Justice Health notes to clearly flag the likelihood of a mental illness. That is confirmed by the notes from Westmead Hospital which pre-date the commission of the alleged offence.
	
	
	Drs Allnutt and Adams have both concluded that the accused is not fit, and I accept the evidence of each.
	
	
	Having considered all of the evidence, and noted the requirements set out in Presser and Kesavarajah, I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that the accused is unfit to be tried, and I make that finding.
	


orders


	
	The orders of the Court are as follows:
	



	
	Pursuant to section 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”) I find that the accused, Daniel Azar, is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder.
	
	
	In accordance with s 14 of the Act, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of the Act, I remand the accused in custody, pending further orders of the court.
	
	
	I direct the Supreme Court Registry to provide the following documents to the Tribunal:
	



	
	A copy of this judgment;
	
	
	A copy of any orders made for detention;
	
	
	A copy of the exhibit papers tendered to this inquiry, being Exhibits 1 and Exhibits A to J; and
	
	
	The Crown Case Statement.
	



	
	The accused’s trial date of 9 November 2015 is vacated.
	
	
	The s 77 order for 9 November 2015 is revoked.

2702622,R v JP [2015] NSWCCA 267,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and under authority, contrary to s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. This offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.


	
	Two further offences of production and dissemination of child abuse material under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act were taken into account on sentence, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	On 17 April 2015 Haesler SC DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months, suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on condition that she be of good behaviour and accept the supervision and all directions of Community Corrections, particularly regarding accommodation, sex offender programs and psychological treatment. The respondent had spent three months in pre-sentence custody and this was taken into account.
	
	
	A Notice of Appeal was signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 29 May 2015. The Director appeals pursuant to s 5E(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate.
	


Factual Background


	
	His Honour described the circumstances of the offending as sad and unique. At the time of the offences, the respondent was in a de facto relationship. The pair had two children, a boy who was 2 years old and a daughter who was born in April 2013 and was 6 weeks old. Although the de facto partner may not have been aware of this at the time, this child was not his biological daughter. The respondent had been having a sexual relationship with another man, her co-offender. She had come to know him through internet contact.
	
	
	On 19 May 2013 the respondent engaged in a Skype chat with this man. The chat extended over a day until 1am on 20 May. During this internet conversation the co-offender referred to requests made earlier for the respondent to send him pictures of her participating in sexual acts with either of her children. The respondent resisted these requests but agreed eventually to take a sexual picture of her daughter. At about 10.30pm she asked the co-offender what he wanted her to do. He replied, “Lick her pussy” while she played with herself. He asked for picture of the act. A short time later at about 11pm, the respondent performed cunnilingus on her daughter. Two images of this were sent to the co-offender. She later created a Word document on her computer, where she saved the message conversation she had had with the co-offender. His Honour concluded that the act was performed not for any sexual gratification on the part of the respondent, but at the request of the co-offender, for his sexual gratification.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied that the offence was brief and that the child would not have understood or appreciated what had happened. His Honour nevertheless characterised the action of the respondent as “a gross violation of the child’s bodily integrity and performed by the one person upon whom a child so young was entitled to rely for protection, her mother”.
	
	
	In about September 2013, a friend borrowed the respondent’s laptop. She came across the saved message conversation. The friend spoke to the respondent and her de facto, about what she had seen. She said that if the respondent did not report the matter then she would do so.
	
	
	On 1 October 2013 the friend mentioned the conversation to someone from the Wesley Mission. This information was conveyed to a Family and Community Services (FACS) worker. On 1 October 2013, the respondent and her de facto attended Liverpool FACS for a previously arranged meeting relating to another subject matter. During the interview the question of the daughter’s paternity came up. During the conversation, the respondent was asked if she were fearful of the child’s actual father. The respondent replied, “We need to tell them; we can’t not tell them.” She then told her partner that she would disclose what happened. She told the FACS worker, “I don’t want to say ... all I ask is you not see me as a bad person. He had me in this little child mind for a while and I did something I regret every single day of my life.” She was asked, “What was that?” She replied, “He asked me to lick her out and I did it.” She was in tears. She told FACS the name of the co-offender, that she understood that he lived in England and that she was no longer in contact with him.
	
	
	Her two children were removed from her later that day.
	
	
	The following day her friend provided a printed version of the conversation with the co-offender to FACS. It was eventually given to police. Attempts to locate the co-offender have not been successful. In August 2014, the Children’s Court made orders that her two children be placed in the custody of the de facto partner. There is a condition of that custody that he not allow the respondent unsupervised contact with her daughter or disclose the offences to the child.
	
	
	On 6 March 2014 the respondent was arrested. She remained on remand, bail refused, until 4 June 2014 when she was granted conditional bail. At the time of sentencing (17 April 2015), the respondent was living at Batemans Bay with her boyfriend with whom she had been in a relationship for eight months.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	When considering the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour noted that every act that involved the sexual exploitation of a child was serious and that this was the reason for the high maximum penalties and high standard non-parole periods fixed for such offences. His Honour stated that the courts had a duty on behalf of the community to do what they could to protect children from sexual abuse. In that regard, his Honour took into account the need for denunciation and the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for this offence.
	
	
	His Honour found that the purposes of the respondent’s action were objectively relevant, i.e. to allow the dissemination of images of the activity. He found that because of the child’s age, there could have been no psychological harm and there was no physical harm. His Honour noted that efforts had been taken to date to ensure that the child was never told of what occurred. His Honour concluded that if those efforts were successful, the child would suffer no psychological harm as a direct consequence of the offence.
	
	
	His Honour did, however, take into account the indirect consequences of the respondent’s actions. He noted that because of what the respondent did, the child would never have the benefit of a mother’s care on a close personal basis and that this might well become a factor in her future development. His Honour took into account that the very actions taken by society to protect the child would have the consequence that the child would not benefit from a mother’s care and attention as she grew.
	
	
	Despite these matters and by reference to observations in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [227] his Honour found that the objective facts put the matter at the very bottom of the range of crimes of this kind.
	
	
	His Honour then took into account the respondent’s subjective case. By reference to the pre-sentence report his Honour noted the following. As a child the respondent suffered from epilepsy with consequent brain injury. This caused the development of an intellectual disability. She was aged 25 at the time of sentence. She had never been in custody before and was a person of prior good character. The report recorded that she felt sick when she thought about what she had done to her daughter, was fearful of returning to custody and was assessed to be at low to medium risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The respondent was assessed by Forensic Psychology Services. She was found suitable for low to moderate intensive treatment but there were no sex offender group based programs available either in custody or in the community. The only treatment program available was through Forensic Psychology Services at Surry Hills Sydney and because of where she lived, it was unlikely that the respondent would ever be able to access that service. In the community she would need to be referred to a private practitioner with experience and training in the management and treatment of sex offenders. The report repeated her expressions of considerable remorse.
	
	
	By reference to a substantial quantity of medical material which had been placed before him, his Honour took into account that the classification “intellectual disability” referred to substantial limitations in functioning. It was characterised by a significantly sub-average intellectual function and limitations in regard to adaptive skills, communication, capacity to care for oneself and other important matters.
	
	
	His Honour observed:
	


“Although terms such as mild, moderate and severe are used, those are terms relative to levels of intellectual disability. They relate to people whose intellectual capacity falls into the very bottom percentage of the community. People with moderate intellectual disabilities require considerable support. While they may have some capacity to interact and carry out normal community tasks there are a number of significant deficits which they suffer. Comparisons with those who have the normal advantages of ordinary intellectual functioning should not and cannot be made.” (ROS 11.2)


	
	His Honour took into account a comprehensive document from FACS which reported that the respondent at the time of the commission of the offence felt quite vulnerable and isolated and that those feelings continued. At the time of sentence, however, she was receiving support and had available to her an Ageing and Disability Homecare support plan.
	
	
	His Honour referred to other medical material before him which confirmed that the respondent was still suffering seizures because of her epilepsy, that she was going to special skills classes but that she had only moderate supported employment. The document recorded that over time she had gone to FACS with cries for help for being suicidal and not being able to cope following the birth of her son and later following the birth of her daughter. His Honour noted that there was a gap in the FACS records between February 2013 and August 2013 when the respondent was being supported by Anglicare but that program terminated just before the birth of her daughter. His Honour said:
	


“She was, at the time of the birth, seeing Karitane and also receiving some other assistance. But it would appear, tragically and unfortunately, because no-one can be blamed for this, that the bulk of her support arrived after the commission of this offence on 19 May and that in the immediate aftermath of her daughter’s birth on 1 April, she was forced to rely on her own very limited resources.” (ROS 12.1)


	
	His Honour referred to the report of Dr Susan Hodgkinson, a neurologist. She confirmed the respondent’s significant intellectual disability. She confirmed the opinion offered by other doctors that by virtue of her intellectual disability, the respondent presented as a vulnerable individual, prone to exploitation and that her difficulties “will impact on her judgment, problem solving, impulse control and capacity for perseverance and consistency”. His Honour observed that all of those matters were relevant to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	His Honour referred to a report from her teacher, Ms Taylor, who dealt with her as a young girl when she went to high school. Ms Taylor reported that “at school [the respondent] appeared more intelligent than her decision making capacities displayed”. Ms Taylor found that the respondent experienced extreme emotional highs and lows and that her inability to manage and problem solve and think through her actions in stressful situations was defining as the most significant impact of her intellectual disability. His Honour observed:
	


“This incapacity was noted well before the commission of this offence. It is a striking feature of the offence that she did commit.” (ROS 12.9)


	
	His Honour referred to a comprehensive report of Dr Susan Hayes AO, Professor of Behavioural Science, Department of Medicine, University of Sydney. Dr Hayes set out in a comprehensive way the background of the respondent. The test results from Dr Hayes placed the respondent in the mild to borderline range of intellectual disability. The tests placed the respondent at or below the bottom 1% on most testing scales, which was fully within what is called the “mild” intellectual disability range.
	
	
	Dr Hayes considered that the respondent was fit to be tried and to plead. She noted the respondent’s dysfunctional family background. She postulated that the relationship with the co-offender brought her some attention, a feeling of being wanted and some excitement. Dr Hayes found:
	


““There is a causal connection between the offences and [the respondent’s] mental conditions of mild intellectual disability, panic anxiety disorder and chronic depression with associated low self-esteem. Her mild intellectual disability limits her ability to foresee the long term outcomes of her actions”.

Dr Hayes recorded other impaired decision making impairments in high level executive functions and found that “although able to cope with custody, it would be a significant detriment to her”. She noted that Justice Health had failed to pick up the fact that she had a disability when she went into custody.


	
	His Honour sought to synthesise the objective elements of the offending and the respondent’s subjective case and to apply established sentencing principle. His dilemma was starkly stated as follows:
	


“A combination of factors, including intellectual disability, chronic depression and the particular circumstances of this offence require a sensitive discretionary decision which focuses on the circumstances, objective and subjective, of this case and this offender and close attention to the purposes to be served by the sentencing process …

Here all of the material before me indicates the offender’s capacity to fully comprehend the wrongfulness of her actions and make reasonable judgments and control her emotions were seriously impeded at the time of the offence. It is also important to note that with help from friends, family, carers and medication and the assistance of a comprehensive treatment plan prepared by the Ageing and Disability section of FACS, she is unlikely to ever offend again.

It is also clear that with that support and having broken the hold apparently held on her by her co-offender, she fully recognises the wrongfulness of her actions and is truly contrite and remorseful. It is an unfortunate fact that such is her remorse that, to quote from the pre-sentence report:

“Although granted access to her children she expresses ongoing grief and at times suicidal ideation that she is not able to have continuous contact with her children.”” (ROS 7.1)

“What then is to be done in a matter such as this? The relevant principles which apply to a person suffering a mental illness or what is described as an intellectual handicap or other mental problems were very succinctly summarised by the Chief Judge at Common Law McClelland in DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 195 at [177]. … Summarising in brief form what Justice McClelland set out:

“(1)    Principle recognises that where a state of a person’s mental or intellectual health contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in sentence”.

Those principles are particularly applicable here.

“(2)    The condition may also have the consequence the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed”.

[The respondent] is not and should never be a vehicle for general deterrence. I note in particular that the maximum penalty and standard non-parole periods are set so high because of this important sentencing principle.

“(3) It may mean that the custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person because the sentence will be more onerous for that person, the length of the prison term or conditions under which it is served may be reduced”.

Again, the evidence before me, particularly what is said by Professor Hayes is important in this matter.

“(4) It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence”.

Here, there has been specific deterrence. The periods in custody have had an effect, mainly negative, but also positive. The realisation of the enormity of what the offender did is also significant. All of the material before me indicates that there is simply no need for further specific deterrence to be incorporated into any sentence which I fix.” (ROS 14.1 – 15.1)


	
	His Honour noted that these matters were factors in the re-sentencing of Mr Muldrock (R v Muldrock; Muldrock v R [2012] NSWCCA 108 (Allsop P with whom Hoeben JA and Beech-Jones J agreed)). His Honour found:
	


“All the material before me indicates that there is, with the appropriate programs being put in place, no prospect that this offender will ever reoffend, the child is not at risk at all from her mother, to the contrary. Her remorse and the impact of this offence upon her means that this offender is punishing herself more than any court could do.

I also have to have regard to the fact that she pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. She would receive the full benefit for the utilitarian value of that plea which is significant. As important however, is the fact that she chose, albeit prompted by her friend’s finding of the material on her computer, to make a full and complete disclosure of this matter to FAC’s and the Police. Without her disclosure it is highly unlikely that the specific offence could ever have been successfully prosecuted. She chose to do that, partly because of the fear that the matter would be disclosed, but more, I accept, because she realised the fundamental wrongness of what she had done.” (ROS 15.3)


	
	His Honour expressed his conclusion as follows:
	


“[The respondent] was particularly vulnerable to exploitation. She committed an offence, brief in nature, which thankfully had no physical, and to date is unlikely to have any psychological impact on her child. [The respondent] has suffered greatly and will continue to suffer for the rest of her life. Her offence will have implications for both of her children. For reasons they may never know, her access to them will be restricted. The community, I believe, would recognise that. No penalty of this Court could punish her more than she has and will punish herself. There are programs in the community to ensure that she is assisted, that her child is assisted and that there would be no repetition of this matter.

Matters which generally attract sentence of imprisonment and fulltime imprisonment so far as general and specific deterrence do not weigh as heavily in this sentencing exercise. In all the circumstances I do not believe it

is necessary, despite the seriousness of what was done, for a fulltime custodial sentence be imposed.” (ROS 16.9 – 17.5)

CROWN SUBMISSIONS

Ground of Appeal: The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate


	
	The Crown submitted that it was not open to his Honour to characterise the objective seriousness of the offence as “at the very bottom of the range of crimes of this nature”. It submitted that his Honour’s error in this regard resulted in a sentence which failed to reflect the true gravity of the respondent’s criminal behaviour. The Crown submitted that his Honour’s findings as to objective seriousness could not properly lead to a conclusion that the objective seriousness was at the “very bottom of the range”. The Crown submitted that sexual interference of a particularly intimate nature with a helpless infant by her own mother at the request of another for the purpose of producing child abuse material involved criminality of a very high level.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour’s findings as to lack of psychological harm suffered by the child were contradictory. While accepting that it was open to find that a six week old baby had no capacity to understand, appreciate or remember events, the Crown referred to the risk identified by his Honour that the child would suffer psychological harm if she later found out what her mother had done. The Crown also referred to the photos, the subject of the Form 1 charges, which had not been retrieved from the co-offender. Finally, the Crown referred to the inevitable psychological harm which the child would suffer as a result of the removal of her mother’s care.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that when those matters were properly taken into account, without any consideration of the respondent’s subjective case, the most favourable assessment from the respondent’s point of view of the objective seriousness of the offending would be that it was either below the mid-range of offending or towards the bottom of the range. The Crown submitted that it was erroneous to assess the objective seriousness as “at the very bottom of the range” and that this had led to error in the sentence imposed.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour’s approach to the Form 1 offences was erroneous.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the two s 91H(2) offences on the Form 1 were also the subject of a s 166 Certificate as indictable offences capable of being dealt with summarily in the Local Court in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and transferred to the District Court’s jurisdiction as “related offences” pursuant to ss 165 – 167 of that Act. The Crown accepted that as a result there would have been a jurisdictional limit on the sentence or sentences to be imposed had the matters been the subject of conviction. The Crown submitted that despite those considerations, the maximum penalty at law, i.e. 10 years imprisonment, was a relevant factor to be taken into consideration by the sentencing judge when assessing the impact of the Form 1 matters on the appropriate sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	The Crown took issue with the following observation of his Honour at ROS 1 – 2:
	


“It is clear … that the offence was committed so that the photographs could be taken and disseminated. It is clear from the agreed facts that the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence, relate to and are impinged on, by the commission of these other offences, for which no conviction will be recorded. Generally matters on a Form 1 increase the penalty required for the principal offence because of the greater weight needed to be given to personal deterrence and retribution. Here, the matters on the Form 1, while they add something, are also intrinsic to my consideration of the objective circumstances of the offence before me for sentence. It is impossible to parse the Form 1 acts and the offence for sentence in any meaningful way. I do take into account the matters on the Form 1 as required, but as will become clear, no significant additional penalty needs to be included in the penalty fixed for the principal offence because of the Form 1 matters.”


	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour’s approach in not imposing any “significant additional penalty” in relation to the Form 1 matters was erroneous. The Crown submitted that in accordance with Abbas Bodiotis Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115; 231 A Crim R 413 regard must be had to the additional criminality in the Form 1 offences as one of many relevant factors when formulating an appropriate sentence for the primary offence. It submitted that the important matter here was that the respondent was well aware that the co-offender wanted images which could be saved. The respondent and the child had no control over what would happen to these child abuse images once they were sent to the co-offender. The Crown submitted that this fact was at the heart of the seriousness of the Form 1 offences and was not properly accounted for in his Honour’s remarks on sentence or in the sentence which he imposed.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was incorrect for his Honour to treat the Form 1 matters more as “context” or “aggravating circumstances” for the sexual assault offence rather than acknowledgements of guilt by the respondent to additional charges to be taken into account when sentencing for the principal offence. The Crown submitted that the fact that the images were created and sent constituted discrete and serious additional offending which should have led to an increase in the sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	While the Crown accepted that in the case of an intellectually disabled person, personal deterrence and retribution had little part to play, there remained “the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed” as a remaining consideration in this case, even though diminished due to the respondent’s mental condition: Attorney General’s Application under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 per Spigelman CJ at [42].
	
	
	The Crown accepted that where there was a causal connection between an offender’s intellectual disability and the offending, it operated to reduce the offender’s moral culpability. It also accepted that in such circumstances the offender was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and that the purposes of sentencing, such as specific deterrence, denunciation and punishment assumed less significance. The Crown submitted, however, that his Honour erred in not properly balancing those considerations against the seriousness of the offending in its totality. The Crown submitted that the suspended sentence (i.e. the mode of serving the sentence imposed) was incapable of reflecting the grave criminality of the respondent’s crime.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the leniency extended by his Honour to the respondent by imposing a sentence which was unduly lenient in how it would be served, went beyond that which the concept of individualised justice could properly allow, given the objective criminality of the offending conduct.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon a comparison with this Court’s decision in R v EG [2015] NSWCCA 21 where the offender was re-sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of term of 1 year for a very similar offence. The distinguishing features were that the child in EG was aged 2, the offender was the grandfather and may have been suffering from early dementia at the time. The Crown submitted that this offence, even allowing for the respondent’s subjective case, was more serious, because of the younger age of the child, the grosser violation of trust by a mother and the involvement of the co-offender.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the Court retained a residual discretion in the exercise of the s 5D jurisdiction to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error had been demonstrated, and manifest adequacy established. The Crown accepted that it must negate any reason why the residual discretion not to interfere should be exercised (CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407 at [36]). Despite the limiting principles which apply to appeals brought by the Crown, it submitted that the Court should intervene in this matter because not only was the sentence indicative of manifest inadequacy but it was inconsistent with sentencing standards expected by the community and inconsistent with the need for a strong denunciation of child sexual exploitation offences. The Crown submitted that there had been no delay in either the institution of the appeal, nor in bringing the matter to Court. The Crown submitted that the respondent was only at an early stage of her post sentencing regime. It submitted that concerns about interfering with the respondent’s rehabilitation should diminish once it was accepted that any sentence imposed on the respondent would of necessity involve a substantial parole period during which supervision and treatment could occur.
	


Consideration


	
	A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the party advancing that complaint to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust. In a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence, judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]); Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]).
	
	
	The High Court has stated on a number of occasions that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons and that the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1].
	
	
	The primary judge in this matter was confronted with a very difficult sentencing exercise. Looked at objectively, the facts of the offending appear damning, particularly the breach of trust and the transference of the two images to the co-offender. But as is so often the case in sentencing matters, the objective facts of the offending do not tell the whole story. When one takes into account the respondent’s subjective case, in particular her intellectual disability which made her susceptible to the domination and pressure exerted by the co-offender, and apply proper sentencing principles which make due allowance for mental disability of this kind, the result when sentencing is complex and difficult to arrive at.
	
	
	The first challenge by the Crown is to the assessment of objective seriousness by the primary judge. There is an initial difficulty with that challenge in that cases such as Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 and Hoskins v R [2015] NSWCCA 245 make it difficult to challenge such an exercise of the sentencing discretion. In Mulato, Spigelman CJ said at [37]:
	


“37   Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion, it was open although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.”


	
	In the same case, Simpson J who agreed with Spigelman CJ added:
	


“46    The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	When assessing the objective seriousness of the offending, there were matters which the primary judge had to carefully balance. A major consideration was the harm caused to the victim. In this case, there was no actual harm either psychological or physical. That was a product of the very young age of the child. The other matters of harm which the primary judge took into account involved a risk of future harm, rather than harm which had actually occurred, e.g. that someone might later tell the child what had occurred and the possible detriment she would suffer by being deprived of a mother’s care.
	
	
	The breach of trust consideration was a matter of considerable seriousness, particularly when one had regard to the subject matter of the Form 1 offences. Looked at in isolation, there was little to be said by way of mitigation of that consideration. Other matters relevant to objective seriousness were the brief duration of the act and that its commission was brought about by the persistent pressure and persuasion by the co-offender. It is when assessing that matter that the distinction between objective considerations and subjective considerations becomes blurred and is difficult to maintain. It is an important consideration that the act which constituted the offence was not something instigated by the respondent but was the product of a long period of pressure on a susceptible person by the co-offender.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, and being particularly mindful of the special position of the primary judge in assessing objective seriousness, I still have a concern about the conclusion that objectively this offence was at the very bottom of the range of offences of this kind. My own assessment would be that, looked at objectively, a more appropriate characterisation would be that it was towards the bottom rather than at the bottom of the range for such offending. Of course that assessment runs the risk of the appellate court substituting its own view of objective seriousness for that of the primary judge. Even so, I am of the opinion that the primary judge’s assessment of objective seriousness was too low. In that regard, there is considerable force in the Crown’s submissions.
	
	
	The Crown submission in relation to the offences on the Form 1, however, are less convincing. In that regard, I find the analysis of the primary judge to be insightful and convincing (see [35] hereof). Although constituting separate offences, in the unusual facts of this case, they provide the essential background to the offending in the principal offence. The principal offence is otherwise without rational explanation. That being so, they impact directly on the seriousness of the principal offence and have the effect of increasing its seriousness. That is the approach followed by the primary judge and that is the effect of s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as explained in The Attorney General’s Application case and in Abbas Bodiotis Taleb and Amoun v R.
	
	
	The Crown submissions on this issue were tantamount to inviting the court to sentence for the Form 1 offences rather than taking them into account as increasing the criminality of the principal offence.
	
	
	The approach followed by the primary judge was consistent with that of this Court in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [42] where Price J (with whom Allsop P and Campbell J agreed) said:
	


“42   The objective seriousness of an offence is to be determined wholly by reference to the ""nature of the offending"". I do not think that the nature of the offending is to be confined to the ingredients of the crime, but may be taken to mean the fundamental qualities of the offence. In my view, where provocation is established such that it is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is a fundamental quality of the offending which may reduce its objective seriousness. It seems to me, that in those circumstances, there cannot be a realistic assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence unless the provocation is taken into account. The absence of provocation is not a factor of aggravation and does not increase the objective seriousness of the offence.”


	
	It follows and I am not persuaded that the primary judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 matters in the particular circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The Crown’s reliance upon the decision in EG is also somewhat problematic. As with most cases in this area, the sentencing outcome was very fact specific. An important consideration in EG was that the victim was aged 2 and had an awareness of the wrongness of the conduct. Moreover, there were accepted adverse sequelae in the behaviour of the victim (albeit not to the level set out in the victim impact statement). This was an important distinction between that case and the matter presently under consideration insofar as objective seriousness is concerned. There was also an important difference in the subjective case of the offender in EG and of the respondent here.
	
	
	The concessions by the Crown in relation to the respondent’s subjective case were appropriate. Her intellectual disability was substantial. A vivid illustration of this was the fact that it was necessary for the person from Anglicare who was assisting the respondent before the offence, to telephone her in order to remind her to take meat which she was intending to cook from the freezer. Her other intellectual detriments and their contribution to the offending were comprehensively set out by Professor Hayes in her report.
	
	
	The effect of the respondent’s subjective case is that little weight was to be given to specific deterrence. Principles such as denunciation, general deterrence and in a general sense retribution, were also to be given less weight. In Muldrock v R the Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:
	


“53   … Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this :

""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""

In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way :

""[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.""

54   The principle is well recognised . It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.”


	
	Despite those appropriate concessions, the thrust of the Crown’s submission is that when it came to synthesising and balancing all relevant considerations, i.e. the objective seriousness, the effect of the Form 1 offences and the subjective case, the primary judge erred. This was not so much in fixing the length of the sentence (although this was not conceded by the Crown) but rather in his determination of the mode in which the sentence should be served. The Crown submitted that a suspended sentence in the circumstances of this case was manifestly inadequate and that this Court should re-exercise the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	As already indicated and with some hesitation, I am of the opinion that his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness that the offending was “at the very bottom of the range for offences of this kind”, was in error. There was, however, no error in his Honour’s approach to the Form 1 offences and no error has been asserted in his Honour’s approach to the respondent’s subjective case. The sentence imposed by his Honour involved an instinctive balancing of all those matters. It is also of significance that the difference in the assessment of objective seriousness, between that which I have suggested and that found by his Honour, is not particularly great, i.e. my assessment was that the objective seriousness was towards the bottom of the range rather than at the very bottom. Despite that difference in the assessment of objective seriousness, I am not satisfied that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The respondent’s compelling subjective case reduced the respondent’s culpability in a very substantial way and had a profound effect on the weight which should be given to objective seriousness in this sentencing exercise. This is particularly so when the sentence took into account 3 months of pre-sentence custody.
	


Residual discretion


	
	Even if the Crown were successful in making out this ground of appeal, there are persuasive discretionary reasons for why this Court should not intervene to re-sentence the respondent.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal, the Court had before it a report from a Senior Community Corrections Officer based at Batemans Bay, dated 31 August 2015 which provided information as to the supervision of the respondent from the date of sentencing. The Court was also provided with affidavits from the respondent’s father and stepmother and two affidavits from Ms Towagi from Legal Aid. No objection was taken to the Court seeing these documents.
	
	
	The report from the Senior Community Corrections Officer showed that the respondent had been favourably responding to the supervision of Community Corrections and she continued to follow directions relating to her good behaviour bond. Her presentation was described as “that of a young woman who has a mild intellectual disability, suffers from depression, epilepsy and reports she continues to take her prescribed medications”.
	
	
	The respondent had also registered with the Child Protection Registry at the Narooma Police Station, which was a consequence of her conviction. She continues to reside with the same partner as when she was sentenced. In June 2015 the respondent was assessed by a forensic psychologist on behalf of Corrective Services as part of her supervisory obligations. The assessment and recommendations of the psychologist were:
	


“[The respondent] would benefit from psychological intervention with a private psychologist focusing on managing any intimacy deficits and her diagnosed depression. [The respondent’s] sexual offending treatment needs are being addressed by participation with Forensic Psychological Services, supervising Community Corrections Officer (CCO) to monitor [the respondent’s] current relationship stability and if CCO has any concerns regarding [the respondent’s] risk of sexual re-offending [the respondent] can be referred to the Corrective Services NSW Senior Forensic Psychologist for further risk management and advice.”


	
	The FACS case worker at Liverpool confirmed to Corrective Services that the respondent was attending supervised access visits with her two children on a bi-monthly basis in Sydney. The relative infrequency of these visits was largely due to the relatively isolated nature of the respondent’s residential address on the far south coast of NSW. Steps were being taken between Corrective Services and FACS to increase the level of contact between the respondent and her children.
	
	
	The affidavit of Ms Towagi of 11 September 2015 set out the contents of a conversation which she had with Ms Taylor, the former teacher of the respondent, who had provided a detailed report for the Court in the sentence proceedings and to which specific reference was made by the primary judge. Ms Towagi deposed:
	


“16   Ms Taylor informed me she had a conversation with the respondent not long after the notice of appeal had been served. Ms Taylor informed me that during that conversation she formed the view that the respondent was depressed. Ms Taylor informed me that the respondent was expressing negative views and also questioned whether she wanted to live anymore. Ms Taylor informed me that the respondent sounded frightened and emotional and “was beside herself about the prospect of going back to prison”.


	
	In an affidavit of 17 September 2015 Ms Towagi annexed the respondent’s mental health care plan prepared by her GP and also noted that the respondent had been to see Mr Tim Goulding, a psychologist practising in the Batemans Bay area.
	
	
	The affidavit of the respondent’s father was dated 11 September 2015. In it he confirmed how upset the respondent was when she was served with the notice of appeal by the police in June 2015. He described the respondent as sounding “hysterical” and saying words to the effect:
	


“Dad I can’t go back there Dad, I can’t go back”.

Later in the affidavit he said:

“11   I was worried about my daughter’s mental health and was concerned she may try to take her life. She has threatened to take her life on at least two occasions during the period from 1 October 2013 when the children were removed and 6 March 2014 when she was charged with the offences. On those occasions I telephoned the police. On one occasion [the respondent] was taken to hospital to be assessed.”

The respondent’s father said that he was regularly in contact with the respondent and that she frequently expressed her sorrow and remorse at what she had done.


	
	The respondent’s stepmother’s affidavit was dated 11 September 2015. She said that she spoke to the respondent on a fortnightly basis by telephone and had done so since the sentence proceedings in April 2015. She said that the respondent frequently told her how sad and unhappy she was about what she had done to her daughter about her inability to be a proper mother to her children and about her fear of returning to prison.
	
	
	The Crown carries the onus of establishing that the residual discretion to refrain from resentencing a respondent should not be exercised by this Court. I am not satisfied that this onus has been discharged.
	
	
	The evidence concerning the respondent following her release on bail in June 2014 and after sentence in April 2015 has made it clear that the respondent’s life has settled down since her release from prison and is relatively stable. The relationship with her present partner appears to be reasonably strong. The respondent has complied with her supervision obligations to Corrective Services and has sought and is receiving medical and psychological assistance.
	
	
	It is clear from the evidence of her father, stepmother and Ms Taylor that notification of the appeal has caused very significant distress and anxiety to the respondent. This has to be assessed in the light of her mental disability and pre-existing and continuing depression.
	
	
	Supervised visits with her children now occur on a bi-monthly basis and ongoing collaboration between Corrective Services and FACS is occurring which should enhance the respondent’s contact with her children. Quite clearly, a return to custody would adversely affect any progress in the relationship between the respondent and her children.
	
	
	For these reasons, in the exercise of the residual discretion I would not have been prepared to re-sentence the respondent even if the Crown had made out its ground of appeal.
	
	
	The order which I propose is that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: Having had the advantage of reading the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and Button J, I find myself in agreement with Button J that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	I do not agree with the primary judge’s assessment that this offence was at the very bottom of the range of objective seriousness of an offence of this kind. Furthermore, I respectfully disagree with the Chief Judge’s characterisation at [50] above that the offence “was towards the bottom rather than at the bottom of the range of such offending.”
	
	
	The cunnilingual abuse of a 6 week old baby by her mother is a crime of the vilest nature. The depravity of the respondent’s offending is enhanced, in my opinion, by her intention to send pictures of her sexual acts to the co-offender for his sexual gratification.
	
	
	The degree of responsibility of a mother to keep her baby safe is of the highest order. The respondent breached her position of trust towards her daughter in the grossest way.
	
	
	When offences of this kind are considered, it is often submitted on behalf of an offender that as the young child would not have been in the position to understand or even appreciate what occurred, there could be no evidence of psychological harm. Indeed, the primary judge made such a finding: (ROS 5). I do not understand how the fact that a child was unknowing can be seen to reduce the objective seriousness of the offence. An unknowing child is a vulnerable victim, who is unable to take any action to protect him or her self from abuse of any kind, let alone the sexual abuse of a mother. A 6 week old baby is helpless and dependant on the care and protection of his or her parent or guardian.
	
	
	The gross breach of trust and utter vulnerability of the respondent’s baby constitute serious aggravating factors on sentence.
	
	
	Section 3A (f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a purpose of sentencing is “to denounce the conduct of the offender.” The principle of denunciation looms large in the present case, notwithstanding the strong subjective circumstances of the respondent.
	
	
	In my opinion, this was a very serious offence.
	
	
	I agree with Button J that no sentence other than a period of full time imprisonment was open to the primary judge.
	
	
	The question remains whether this Court should refrain from resentencing the respondent in the exercise of the residual discretion. I am grateful for the Chief Judge’s careful consideration of this issue and agree with his Honour’s reasons that residual discretion should be exercised.
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree with the order proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BUTTON J: Although I agree in the order proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL, I arrive at that destination by way of a different path of reasoning. Because of the comprehensive discussion of all relevant aspects of the matter in the judgment of the Chief Judge, I can be brief.
	
	
	To my mind, in the circumstances of this case, featuring as it did the performance of cunnilingus on a six-week-old baby by her mother so that images of that act could be transmitted to another person for his repeated sexual gratification, no sentence other than a period of full-time imprisonment was open to the discretion of the learned sentencing judge.
	
	
	It follows that, in my opinion, and with great respect to the sentencing judge – whose eminence in the field of criminal law is well-known – the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. And I say that bearing firmly in mind the very powerful subjective case, to which the intellectual disability of the respondent was central; the extra curial punishment; the period already spent by her in prison bail refused; and the fact that two offences were dealt with by way of a Form 1.
	
	
	One need hardly embark upon an exercise of seeking to discern community standards with regard to such conduct: the Australian community would react to the deplorable crimes of the respondent with abhorrence. And in any event, the community has expressed its response to penetrative sexual contact with children under the age of 10 years: Parliament has prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life without possibility of parole, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years.
	
	
	In short, I respectfully disagree with the Chief Judge. I consider that the Crown has established the ground of appeal: the sentence imposed was indeed manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Having said that, however, I respectfully agree with the Chief Judge that, in the compelling circumstances of this case, the Crown has failed to establish that this Court should refrain from exercising its discretion not to intervene in the matter. To express that concept more concisely and comprehensibly, the respondent should not now be returned to custody.
	
	
	It is for the foregoing reasons that I agree that the order proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL should be made by this Court.

2702623,R v Maybir (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1737,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This trial involves an allegation by the Crown that the accused committed a variety of offences against a seven year-old boy, the son of Ms Kayla James, culminating in murder on 20-21 May 2013. (See R v Maybir (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 1736 at [1]-[4] for a slightly more detailed overview.)
	
	
	The Crown has given notice pursuant to s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) of an intention to adduce tendency evidence from a number of witnesses. It has also put the defence on notice of an intention to lead ""context evidence"". Mr Brady SC objects to such evidence being given by the accused's former wife, Ms Naomi Brealey.
	
	
	I received evidence on the voir dire and heard submissions from counsel on the afternoon of Friday 9 October 2015. Just before I was to give my ruling when court resumed on Monday 12 October the Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to other evidence that may be relevant to my decision. He referred to a police interview of Ms Kayla James on 4 September 2014 and a statement by Ms Ecelini Brealey of 29 May 2013. Mr Brady said that he accepted that the former was admissible as context evidence but he objected to the latter on the basis that it was being led in support of tendency reasoning.
	
	
	I announced rulings upon the conclusion of the submissions on 12 October 2015. The following represents my reasons for such rulings.
	


Tendency evidence


	
	The tendency set out in the notice is inaptly expressed. It was reformulated in the course of submissions by the Crown Prosecutor as a tendency of the accused to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, namely:
	


(a) to assault young children in his care using his hands or objects for the purpose of disciplining or punishing them; and

(b) to cause harm to young children in his care or to be indifferent to the harm caused to them. (T157.47)


	
	The evidence in the statement of Ms Naomi Brealey of 29 May 2013, the subject of the objection appears in three paragraphs:
	


“[17] Kodi would get very angry easily when the kids would cry. When the kids would cry he would yell at me to make them stop or he would yell at them. When they wouldn’t stop or were throwing a tantrum, Kodi would grab the kid’s faces by their cheeks with his right hand as he was right handed. Kodi had huge hands and would be able [to] wrap his hands around from ear to ear of each of the kids to stop them from crying. As he was holding their faces, he would yell at the kids telling them to stop. I would disagree with how he did this and would have many arguments about this. The more noise the kids would make, the harder he would squeeze which made things worse as the kids would cry even more as I could see that it was hurting the kids. When I tried to stop him, it made him even more angrier. Kodi would only do this in front of me or his immediately family, but never in front of anyone else. When we were out [in] public, if the kids were to misbehave, he would use a technique which his mother told the two of us she would use which was to grab the misbehaving child by the upper arm and whilst grabbing the upper arm, softer flesh part of the arm would be pinched whilst the child was being dragged along to act as a punishment without causing a scene. I saw Patricia use on her grandchildren and Kodi tried to use it as well when we were going out, however I saw that it didn’t work, the pinching of the upper arm only caused the kids to be more upset and I would step in before Kodi could use this technique on the kids.

[18] When [the children] were misbehaving but more so if they were crying, Kodi would lose control and would depending on the circumstances, he would react in different ways. He could stand and scream, he could grab the child’s face to stop the crying, lock them in a dark room or he would smack the child with his hands or an object. Kodi would smack the kids on the bottom, back of the legs, sometimes the back and on the hands, rarely around the face or neck. Kodi used to use a wooden spoon, a wooden ruler or a plastic kitchen utensil. He was really old school with his discipline methods and there were times when I was cooking I couldn’t find a wooden spoon in the kitchen, but there were wooden spoons all over the house except for in the kitchen. Kodi also carried a wooden stick in the car, which he would use to smack the kids if they were mis-behaving in car trips. Although he would try [to] not leave bruises on the kids, if he used his hands, the strength of his hands would leave bruising on the kids bodies. There was one occasion where Kodi smacked [our son] on the bottom so hard, I could see a bruise in the form of Kodi’s hand print on [our son’s] bottom.

…

[20] In February 2012, I got a job with Sony at North Ryde. We soon moved from Carlton to Kyeemagh to save some money as I was the sole money earner. Kodi had finished working with the concierge job and was unemployed. Kodi would then drive me to work at North Ryde almost everyday with the kids in the car. The trip from Kyeemagh to North Ryde would be at least 45 to 90 minutes one way. The kids would be in the car for the whole time and would become distressed at being in the car for such a long time. We would argue almost the entire time going to work as he was always irritable in the morning, however on the way home, he would be excited as he would be going back to the studio after we got home. The kids, especially [our daughter] would be so distressed with the travel and our arguing that she would on occasions become physically ill and Kodi would get angry and tell me to ignore her as [our daughter] was only doing it for attention. Kodi would also frequently use the wooden spoon or stick in the car to smack the kids. He would go into fits of rage when he was angry and driving, he would drive in the direction of a telegraph pole to scare us or scream at the top of his lungs and striking the dashboard frightening me and the kids.


	
	Ms Naomi Brealey's evidence of the accused grabbing the children's faces by their cheeks with his right hand is of particular significance. In the report of the autopsy examination of the deceased's body, Dr Issabella Brouwer, forensic pathologist, included that she found bruising consistent with having been caused by fingertips and subsurface bleeding on both sides of the face (one bruise on the right side and three on the left) as well as a fracture in the left parietal bone that are consistent with having been caused by the deceased's face having been gripped by a person's right hand with significant force.
	
	
	The statement of Ms Ecelini Brealey, the mother of Naomi Brealey, provides similar evidence:
	


“There were times when the kids were not listening to Kodi, especially with [the male child] when they would come out of the room with Kodi. Kodi would grab [the male child] by the face especially if he was crying and yell, ‘Look at me, I’m talking to you.’ Kodi would grab [the male child] by his cheeks with the one hand and pull [the male child’s] face towards him whilst Kodi would yell at him. If [the male child] was still crying he would hit him with a wooden spoon and also with his hands across [the male child’s] bottom or legs. Kodi would not hit [the female child], but just yell at her.”


	
	The police interview of Ms Kayla James of 4 September 2014 (at Q415 - 443) contains an account of a practice of the accused to grab the deceased child's face, for example:
	


“Open hand, or he would grab [the deceased’s] face and shove it backwards … he’ll grab him by the face and I can see him getting really angry and upset and squeeze his face and he’ll try and force him to say something. [The deceased] would just squeal.”

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence of Ms Naomi Brealey, having regard to the evidence of the forensic pathologist, has significant probative value (s 97(1)(b)) in tending to show that the accused acted in the same way at or around the time of the acts which caused death.
	
	
	Ms Brealey's children were much younger than the deceased at the time the accused is said to have behaved in this way towards them; probably aged 2 and 4 compared to the deceased who was aged 7. The Crown Prosecutor noted in this context that whilst the deceased was aged 7, he weighed only 20 kilograms at the time of his death; a weight more consistent with a child of the age of 5.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the multiple injuries sustained by the deceased, including but not limited to the fatal severe blunt force trauma to the back of the head are not explained by any of the versions given by the accused in police interviews, or in the further version that it is anticipated will be given according to the defence opening address.
	
	
	Also in paragraph 17 of Ms Naomi Brealey's statement is her account of the accused having a habit of grabbing the upper arm of a misbehaving child and pinching the soft flesh part. The Crown Prosecutor referred to Dr Brouwer's report in which she said she found multiple bruises on both arms, many having a round to oval shape suggestive of having been caused by fingertips. These findings did not exactly align with what Ms Brealey will speak of but it was submitted that there was ""quite strong probative value"" nonetheless. This was not developed, but I assume he was referring to a tendency to forcefully grab the arms of children.
	
	
	In paragraph 18 of Ms Brealey's statement there is reference to the accused using his hands or an implement such as a wooden stirring spoon, a wooden ruler or a plastic kitchen utensil to strike her children. This was said to go to a tendency in the accused to punish young children in a way that is not consistent with any civilised view (which it is anticipated that the accused will claim to have had) about the welfare of the deceased.
	
	
	It was submitted that if the conclusion was reached that the evidence had ""significant probative value"" (s 97(1)(b)) I would find that there is no danger of unfair prejudice, or, using the terms of the statute, ""the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant"" (s 101). This was said to be because there is no danger of the jury misusing the evidence or, if there was some minimal danger, then the usual directions that would be given by me to the jury would be sufficient to alleviate against it.
	
	
	I take the Crown to be advancing the evidence of Ms Ecelini Brealey as tendency evidence on the same basis as the evidence of her daughter. In further submissions made on 12 October 2015, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the anticipated defence case, as disclosed in Mr Brady's opening, to blame Ms Kayla James for having assaulted the deceased child in a manner that caused the injuries that the Crown says were likely caused by the accused having forcefully grabbed the child's face as described by both Ecelini and Naomi Brealey (as well as Ms James herself).
	


Defence submissions


	
	Mr Brady accepted that ""the more specific the evidence in relation to … tendency the more probative it is going to be"" and conceded that the most probative of the evidence the Crown seeks to rely upon is that relating to the fingerprint bruises to the deceased's face. However, he submitted that the difference in the ages of the children concerned was significant and so too was the fact that Ms Naomi Brealey speaks of the accused's behaviour with his own children whereas he had no familial relationship with the deceased. The latter point was said to be significant in the context of the accused having some responsibility for disciplining his own children and not in relation to Ms James' children.
	
	
	As to the evidence concerning the accused grabbing the arms of his own children, Mr Brady submitted that there was little or no similarity with the bruising observed by Dr Brouwer. The same was said in relation to the evidence of the accused hitting children with an implement such as a wooden spoon. These activities Ms Naomi Brealey may give evidence about were submitted to be too broad, even generic, to have significant probative value in establishing a relevant tendency.
	
	
	As to whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect upon the accused, Mr Brady accepted that there was less danger in relation to the face grabbing evidence. However, in relation to the other activity there was a danger that the jury would simply conclude that the accused is a violent person, or conducted himself in a way that was inconsistent with a civilised view as to the welfare of children, and in either case move from such a conclusion to a finding of guilt.
	
	
	Mr Brady, in essence, relied upon the same submissions when the evidence of Ms Ecelini Brealey was raised on 12 October 2015.
	


Determination


	
	After reflecting upon Mr Brady's submissions, I raised with the Crown Prosecutor on 12 October 2015 whether the Crown was confining the use of the proposed tendency evidence to the acts which caused death. As I suspected, it was confirmed that the Crown would rely upon the evidence as being capable of establishing the tendencies as formulated during the course of submissions (see above at [5]) which is relevant to the treatment of the deceased by the accused in the weeks and months preceding his death as well as, by inference, on the day the injuries that caused death were inflicted.
	
	
	As to the differences in the ages of Ms Brealey's children and the age of the deceased, rather than detracting from probative value this factor is either neutral, or enhances it. That a person was prepared to act in such a way towards children of extremely tender years may indicate that they would be equally likely, and perhaps more likely, to act in such a way towards a child who was a little older.
	
	
	In my view, Ms Naomi Brealey's evidence of the accused's habit of grabbing children by the face, and with force, has significant probative value on its own. So too does the similar evidence of Ms Ecelini Brealey. So too does the combination of this with the other acts of ""discipline"" referred to by Ms Naomi Brealey in establishing a tendency to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind as the Crown has described those attributes. That the accused may be shown to have had such tendencies is relevant generally to the Crown case and particularly so in relation to the inferences the Crown will be inviting the jury to draw as to the manner in which the deceased's death was caused.
	
	
	The jury will be directed that they cannot use the evidence in the illogical way that Mr Brady expressed concern about in his submissions regarding the prejudicial effect of the evidence. I do not believe that the evidence is of a type that would be beyond the capability of a jury to comply with directions as to its permissible and impermissible uses: see, for example, Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [48]-[50].
	
	
	As an exception to this reasoning, I was not persuaded that the evidence set out in paragraph 20 of Ms Naomi Brealey's statement of 29 May 2013 is admissible. The Crown Prosecutor said that he relied upon the last two sentences. That which precedes them simply provides their context. There is already evidence in paragraph 18 of the statement about the accused's resort to an implement such as a wooden spoon to discipline the children. That which appears in the penultimate sentence is just repetition. That which appears in the last sentence is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. The evidence in this paragraph is inadmissible.
	


Context evidence


	
	The Crown has notified the accused's solicitor of an intention to adduce evidence as ""context evidence … relating to the punishment and discipline regime implemented by Kodi Maybir on [the deceased] (and where applicable on [the deceased's two siblings])"". It was specified that this evidence will include as components of such regime:
	


1.   Running on the spot

2.   Running along the beach

3.   Food deprivation

4.   Water deprivation

5.   Segregation

6.   Eating faeces

7.   Ice down the underpants

8.   Cold showers

9.   Tying string between the toes and penis

10.    Standing on coffee tin

11.   Squatting against the wall

12.   Shaving head of the deceased

13.   Chanting


	
	It was said that the above matters ""demonstrate the environment in which the alleged offences occurred and place the alleged offences in their proper context"". (Query whether the evidence might more aptly be described as ""background evidence"".)
	
	
	In relation to Ms Naomi Brealey, the Crown Prosecutor pointed to certain passages in her statement which indicate she may give evidence of the following matters:
	


An incident in 2005 when the pair were at a shopping centre when he became angry with her. He gave vent to his anger by yelling at her when she was in the ladies restroom and, after she had emerged, taking off his sunglasses and crushing them in his hands and taking out his wallet and throwing it at her. Later that day he apologised to her. He blamed his childhood and as well as an evil spirit that caused him to behave that way. He said a prayer to remove the evil spirit. (Paragraph 9)

After the couple became engaged in 2007 they moved to live together as her parents were not supportive of the engagement. She described this as a ""very tumultuous period where he would try to turn me against my family by saying that it was an evil spirit sent from my family that was causing the unhappiness we were experiencing"". (Paragraph 12)

There was an occasion after they were married and had seen the birth of their first child in the latter half of 2008 when the accused came home late at night well affected by drugs. Ms Brealey was awoken by a loud crashing noise and found the accused lying on the bottom of the staircase asleep. The next day he told her ""that he was pushed in the back by an unknown force which he claimed was an evil spirit"". (Paragraph 13)

Crown submissions


	
	It was conceded that this was evidence of ""the context of another relationship"" but submitted that it ""tends to inform the state of mind and the view of the world that Kodi Maybir had"". Further, it was anticipated that it would confirm a number of things that Ms Kayla James would say in her evidence.
	
	
	The Crown anticipates that it will be the defence case that the accused was infatuated with Ms James and that ""really she was the driving force"" in the relationship and in the parenting of the children. Ms James, the Crown expects, will paint a contrary picture. The Crown case is that ""she was under his thrall"" and one aspect of her evidence will concern a belief, derived from the accused, about the ""devil"" getting into people, particularly the children.
	


Defence submissions


	
	Mr Brady submitted that this was not context evidence; it was really evidence led to invoke impermissible tendency reasoning. The Crown intends to invite the jury to reason that inferences can be drawn from the way the accused spoke and behaved in an earlier relationship to support Ms James' evidence that he spoke and behaved in the same way in his relationship with her.
	
	
	In the course of Mr Brady's submissions I raised with him the case of Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303. He submitted that the so-called ""context evidence"" in this case was in reality a tendency to have a particular state of mind, as was recognised by the Court in that case (at [361]). But the Court went on in Elomar to accept that the trial judge in that case was right to have held that the evidence established that the appellant had a particular and continuing state of mind and as such it was not tendency evidence. Mr Brady maintained, however, that in this case and having regard to the gap in time between the events Ms Brealey would speak of and the events of 2013 with which this trial is concerned that it is inapt to speak of the evidence establishing a ""continuing state of mind"".
	
	
	It was submitted that even if I came to the view that the evidence was relevant as context evidence in the way the Crown contended I would exclude it nonetheless on the basis that the probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: s 137 of the Evidence Act. The evidence is concerned with events in 2005, 2007 and 2008. The events with which this trial is concerned occurred about five or more years later when the accused was in a relationship with a different woman with, obviously, different children. It involves evidence of the accused dealing with ""evil spirits"". And, questions of bad character also arise.
	


Determination


	
	This trial is more concerned about the conduct of the accused than his “state of mind”. His state of mind might provide an explanation for his conduct but that is as far as it goes. The fact that he had a particular state of mind might also make a conclusion more easily reached that he behaved in a particular way. However, I think there is considerable force in Mr Brady's submission that the gap in time tends to negate continuity of mindset and renders the evidence more akin to invoking tendency reasoning.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the evidence has much probative value and I am concerned about the danger of unfair prejudice. It is quite peripheral to the issues the jury will be called upon to decide. It will be a distraction. If the evidence of what occurred in 2013 is insufficient to persuade the jury about the accused's conduct then I do not think they will be assisted in a fair and rational way about other events which occurred five or more years earlier and in a different relationship if they were not to engage in tendency reasoning.
	


Conclusions


	
	The ruling which I gave on 12 October 2015 was as follows:
	


1.   The evidence in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the statement of Ms Naomi Brealey of 29 May 2013 is admissible as tendency evidence.

2.   The evidence in paragraph 20 of that statement is inadmissible.

3.   The evidence in paragraph 9 of the statement of Ms Ecelini Brealey of 29 May 2013 is admissible as tendency evidence.

4.   The proposed ""context evidence"" to be given by Ms Naomi Brealey is inadmissible.

		20 November 2015",2015-10-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702624,R v Maybir (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 1736,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Kodi James Maybir, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of a 7 year old child at Oatley on 20-21 May 2013. He was also arraigned upon a number of other charges, to which he pleaded guilty to some and not guilty to others. Those other charges concern offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, reckless wounding, inciting a person under 16 to an act of indecency knowing the act was being filmed for the purpose of producing child abuse material, and producing child abuse material. All of those charges relate to the same child and they are alleged to have been committed in the period of 8 March to 19 May 2013.
	
	
	The child who is the victim, or alleged victim, of these offences was the eldest of three children of a woman with whom the accused had been in a relationship since about mid-January 2013.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that in the early morning of 20 May 2013 the accused physically assaulted the child with the intention of killing him, or at least of causing him really serious harm. The defence case is that there was no such assault, let alone such intention. It will be contended that the injuries which caused the death of the child were sustained as a result of an accident; in the course of the accused playing with the child he accidentally fell to the floor and thereby sustained the relevant injuries. No medical attention was provided to the child. He was found to be deceased about 24 hours later.
	
	
	Other injuries to the child were detected during the course of an autopsy examination. Of particular significance for the Crown are certain bruises and a bone fracture to the front and sides of the face. The Crown contends they were caused by the accused forcefully taking hold of the child’s face but the defence contends that the facial injuries were sustained as a result of the child being hit by his mother with force in the face “shortly before” (T57.18).
	
	
	The Crown will be relying upon the evidence of the accused’s former wife to the effect that he had a practice of taking hold of their children’s faces with one hand and with force; something that is consistent with bruising and a fracture found on the deceased child. The Crown relies upon this for tendency reasoning. I ruled on the admissibility of this evidence separately (see R v Maybir (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1737) but held that it is admissible.
	


The evidence to which objection was taken


	
	The Crown proposed to lead evidence from a witness, Ms Patricia Connell, the mother of the accused, in terms of what appeared in a statement she made on 21 May 2013 (at [19]). Before referring to it, the context was that Ms Connell gave evidence that she received a telephone call from the accused at 6.00am on 21 May 2013 and he said to her: ""Mum, can you come to the studio please as soon as possible because something really bad has happened"". (The “studio” was the place where the accused, the deceased, and the deceased’s mother and younger siblings were then living.)
	
	
	It was anticipated that Ms Connell would give evidence that she went to the studio in response to this call. She would say that she parked her car and then the following occurred:
	


“[19] I walked up the driveway around to the car park of the studio and I saw some ambulances parked there. I saw the ambulance officers and uniformed police standing around talking. My immediate worry was for Kodi as he is my son. Kodi has been so broken hearted lately and sometimes he loses it inside himself. It all gets too much for him and he will have to let it out. I know on two occasions he has punched a wall or a window in pure frustration and he hurt himself. I was thinking that Kodi had probably done something like that but hurt himself really badly.”


	
	Mr Brady SC, on behalf of the accused, objected to the evidence I have italicised in the above extract from the statement. On 9 October 2015 I ruled that the evidence was not admissible (T156.5). The following explains that ruling:
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown Prosecutor referred to the features of the anticipated defence that I have summarised above (taken from the defence opening to the jury) and also to three other versions of explanation by the accused as to how the child sustained the fatal injuries given in police interviews: the child fell off a pogo stick; the child fell once when required to stand on objects as a disciplinary exercise; the child fell twice during such an exercise. It is the Crown case that the three versions the accused has given, and the fourth anticipated to be given, are incapable of belief and that “accident” is not a reasonably possible cause of the relevant injuries.
	
	
	It was submitted that:
	


“[The accused] has assaulted this child in a brutal and violent way and [the] evidence [of Ms Connell] that he acts, to the extent of punching a wall or window extremely [hard] enough to hurt himself when it all gets too much for him, the Crown says has powerful probative force on a circumstantial basis.” (T. 151.19)


	
	At this point of the submissions it was conceded that the purpose for which the Crown wished to adduce the evidence was to support tendency reasoning. No notice of an intention to rely upon this evidence as tendency evidence pursuant to s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) had been given but Mr Brady indicated that he did not wish to (he said he did not need to) take any point about notice.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that the probative value of the evidence was greater when assessed in the light of the defence case as outlined in Mr Brady’s opening address.
	
	
	Mr Brady submitted that the evidence does not have significant probative value as required by s 97(1)(b). A tendency to strike out at an inanimate object when the accused loses control is too different to what the Crown alleges was the striking of the deceased child with the intention of killing or causing really serious harm. Further, there was a real risk of unfair prejudice in that the jury may place too much weight on a tendency to strike out in circumstances where it is to strike an inanimate object; it may place too much weight on a conclusion that the accused just loses his temper generally and too readily conclude that he is more likely to have assaulted the deceased with the necessary intention for murder.
	
	
	In reply, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that it did not matter that Ms Connell’s evidence concerned the accused striking out at an inanimate object. The important feature was that it showed that he had a tendency, when angry, to strike out at anything; even at a hard surface oblivious to the risk of harming himself.
	


Determination


	
	Ms Connell’s assertion that the accused “sometimes … loses it inside himself” and “it all gets too much for him and he will have to let it out” on its own is so general as to be almost completely devoid of probative value. It is qualified by the subsequent sentence that she is aware of two occasions in which “he has punched a wall or a window in pure frustration and hurt himself”.
	
	
	However, as far as I am aware, there is no evidence that on the morning of 20 May 2013 when the fatal assault is alleged to have occurred, “it all [got] too much for [the accused]” and “he … [had] to let it out”.
	
	
	Moreover, there is nothing to indicate the circumstances in which the prior acts of punching a wall or window occurred and certainly nothing to suggest that it involved the accused’s interaction with children. The evidence is so general as to lack the necessary probative value: s 97(1)(b) Evidence Act; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at [53] (Campbell JA); Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [39]-[45] (Hoeben CJ at CL).
	


Conclusion


	
	The evidence is inadmissible as it does not have significant probative value.

		20 November 2015",2015-10-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702625,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 11) [2015] NSWSC 1541,"Judgment (on crown application under s.38 evidence act 1995 to cross-examine a3 - t1051)


	
	JOHNSON J: Application is made once again by the Crown for leave to cross-examine a Crown witness, in this case A3.
	
	
	The principles to be applied on an application of this sort, including the relevant terms of ss.38 and 192 Evidence Act 1995, are set out in earlier judgments which I have delivered on similar topics concerning other persons: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) [2015] NSWSC 1472; R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) [2015] NSWSC 1491. I apply those principles again with respect to this application.
	
	
	As the jury is waiting, I will give concise reasons for the rulings which I make.
	
	
	A3 is an important witness in the trial. She is, on her own evidence, a person in the bedroom at her house at Wollongong at the time when the alleged events concerning C1 occurred. Accordingly, some of the observations I made with respect to her sister, in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) at [16], are relevant.
	
	
	Insofar as A3 has been asked to give an account of what occurred in the bedroom on the day in question when C1 was lying on the bed, I am satisfied for the purpose of s.38(1)(b), that there are matters of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge, and about which it appears to the Court the witness is not, in examination-in-chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence. Having regard to what the witness herself has described as the novelty of the events occurring in her own bedroom on that day, I am satisfied that that particular head of s.38 has been made out, given her limited response to the questions put by the Crown in that regard.
	
	
	Next, concerning the questions that have been asked of the witness today with respect to the topic of “khatna”, I am satisfied that inconsistency has been demonstrated for the purpose of s.38(1)(c) of the Act, by reference to parts of telephone intercepts to which I have been referred. In this respect, I refer expressly to Exhibit AA, Tab 15 (page 2ff), Tab 28 (page 1ff) and Tab 29 (page 1ff), together with the transcript of evidence given by the witness at the pretrial hearing on 12 August 2015 (in particular, PT258 to 259, 260, 262 and 265). I note that there is relevant inconsistency insofar as comparison is made between the witness' account today, and on that occasion, concerning her observations with respect to C1's dress.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, with respect to the subject of “khatna”, that the witness may be regarded as unfavourable for the purpose of s.38(1)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown has sought to rely upon evidence given today concerning the so-called “Africa checking” story, and what the witness is disclosed as discussing in telephone intercepts concerning that issue. In particular, reliance was placed upon Exhibit AA, Tab 15 and Tab 38, and pretrial Exhibit PTK, Tab 32, with the relevant page references mentioned in the Crown schedule (MFI 56).
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the Crown has, to this point, established inconsistency for the purpose of s.38(1)(c) on this topic. Short questions have been asked of the witness, which have involved effectively either an indication of lack of recollection or answers which, in my view, fall short of inconsistency. Leave will not be granted on that topic upon the basis of what has been said so far.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown submission concerning the suggested role of KM as a circumciser in the Dawoodi Bohra community, I am not persuaded that the parts pointed to by the Crown in that respect call for a grant of leave on that topic. Those references are Exhibit AA Tab 15 (page 6ff) and Tab 29 (page 2ff). I do not grant leave with respect to that topic.
	
	
	Insofar as the Crown sought, by way of a supplementary submission, to contend that the “Africa checking” story was one which ought give rise to a grant of leave to cross-examine the present witness upon the basis of credibility, I am not so persuaded.
	
	
	If some additional foundation is laid for that aspect being further considered, I will deal with it then. However, I am not persuaded that a grant of leave ought be made now in that respect. In this regard, I note that Exhibit AA is already in evidence and before the jury. There is material there about which it is open to the Crown to make submissions. Four of the five recorded conversations, upon which the Crown seeks leave to cross-examine the present witness, are already in evidence.
	
	
	I have given consideration to other issues arising under ss.38 and 192. Having done so, I propose to grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine on the identified topics which I have mentioned.

		17 November 2015",2015-10-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702634,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sun [2015] NSWSC 1178,"Judgment


	
	By its Second Amended Summons the Plaintiff seeks two orders against the Second Defendant, Xiao Yan Xu, also known as Susan Xu. First, the Plaintiff seeks under s 22 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (“the Act”) an assets forfeiture order in respect of the Second Defendant’s interest in a house and land at 14 Wondabah Place, Carlingford, New South Wales (“the Carlingford property”). The property was purchased by the Second Defendant under a contract dated 10 February 2008. The purchase was completed on 19 March 2008 and the Second Defendant has been registered as proprietor since that date.
	
	
	The price of the property was $880,000 of which slightly less than $500,000 was advanced to the Second Defendant by St George Bank on security of a first mortgage. The deposit of $88,000 was paid as to $2,200 in cash and the balance by bank cheque (which had been purchased for cash). Most of the remainder of the purchase price came from an account at HSBC Bank, Burwood (New South Wales) branch in the name of the Second Defendant’s ex-husband Ling Rong Sun also known as James Sun.
	
	
	After the St George Bank loan had been drawn down to complete the purchase on 19 March 2008, the loan account was debited each month with an interest charge, commencing at 8.24% pa and varying to as low as 5.76% pa by early 2009. Regular payments were made by or on behalf of the Second Defendant to keep pace with the interest charges. In addition substantial payments were made in reduction of principal. The total of all payments to the credit of this home loan in the period from when it was drawn down until 15 April 2009 (being the end of the period in respect of which the proceeds assessment order is sought) was $283,758.65. At that time the balance of the home loan owing to the bank was $240,224.48.
	
	
	The latest date for which the evidence provides a balance of this home loan, secured by the mortgage over the Carlingford property, is 30 June 2009. At that date the amount owing was $238,632.26. Thus the value of the Second Defendant’s equity in the Carlingford property, which the Plaintiff seeks to forfeit, is the current value less the loan balance. There is no evidence of current value but it would likely be well in excess of the $880,000 paid nine years ago so that the equity must exceed $640,000.
	
	
	Secondly, the Plaintiff seeks a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act. That is, an order that the Second Defendant “pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by [the Second Defendant] from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of [the Second Defendant] or another person that took place not more than six years before the making of the application for the order” (s 27(1)).
	
	
	The application for this order was first made by the filing of an Amended Summons on 15 April 2009. The period to be examined as to whether illegal activities may have taken place is therefore 15 April 2003 to 15 April 2009.
	
	
	If this order is to be made the Court will also be required to assess the value of the proceeds of illegal activity which have been derived by the Second Defendant. Under s 28 of the Act that is to be done in this case by treating all of the Second Defendant’s expenditure during the six year period as proceeds derived from illegal activity, subject only to deduction of expenditures which are proved to have been “funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities” (s 28(3)).
	


Legal basis of s 22 forfeiture order: “serious crime related activity”


	
	The Plaintiff’s claim for forfeiture of the Carlingford property pursuant to s 22 of the Act was first made by way of a second amendment to its Summons. The Second Amended Summons was filed on 17 December 2013. Forfeiture is sought in reliance upon subs (1A) (a) and sub s (2) of s 22 of the Act. The relevant provisions are as follows:
	


“22 Making of assets forfeiture order

(1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for an order forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person (an assets forfeiture order).

(1A) The application must specify that the interest in property is an interest in property of any one or more of the following kinds:

(a) an interest in property of a person suspected by an authorised officer, at the time of the application, of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities,

(b) an interest in property suspected by an authorised officer, at the time of the application, of being serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of a person,

(c) an interest in property held in a false name that is suspected by an authorised officer, at the time of the application, to be fraudulently acquired property that is illegally acquired property.

(1B) An assets forfeiture order may be made whether or not an application for a restraining order relating to the interests in property the subject of the application for the assets forfeiture order has been made or granted.

(2) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order in respect of an interest in property referred to in subsection (1A) (a) or (b) if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, formed the basis of the application for the assets forfeiture order was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application, engaged in:

(a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or

(b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.

(2A) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order if the Court finds it more probable than not that interests in property subject to an application are fraudulently acquired property that is also illegally acquired property.”


	
	To succeed on this part of its case the Plaintiff must show, first that an authorised officer suspects the Second Defendant of “having engaged in a serious crime related activity” (subs (1A)(a)). Mr Spark, the Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, of the Plaintiff is an “authorised officer” as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, by virtue of a written general authorisation given to him by the Commission.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn 15 April 2009 he deposed that he then suspected the Second Defendant had falsely represented, amongst other things, her taxable income for the 2006 and 2007 financial years, in connection with her application for the $500,000 loan from St George Bank in February 2008. On that basis Mr Spark deposed to a further suspicion that the Second Defendant “had engaged in a serious crime related activity” in that she had offended against s 178BB(1), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In an affidavit sworn 7 November 2013 filed in connection with the Plaintiff’s application to re-amend its summons to claim the forfeiture order under s 22, Mr Sparke re-stated these suspicions.
	
	
	Until its repeal with effect from 22 February 2010 s 178BB(1), Crimes Act was in the following terms:
	


“178BB Obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements

(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.”


	
	The definition of “serious crime related activity” in the Act, so far as relevant for present purposes, is contained in the following parts of s 6:
	


“6 Meaning of “serious crime related activity”

(1) In this Act, a reference to a serious crime related activity of a person is a reference to anything done by the person that was at the time a serious criminal offence, whether or not the person has been charged with the offence or, if charged:

(a) has been tried, or

(b) has been tried and acquitted, or

(c) has been convicted (even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside).

(2) In this section, a reference to a serious criminal offence is a reference to:

…

(d) an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involves theft, fraud, obtaining financial benefit from the crime of another, money laundering, extortion, violence, bribery, corruption, harbouring criminals, blackmail, obtaining or offering a secret commission, perverting the course of justice, tax or revenue evasion, illegal gambling, forgery or homicide, or …”


	
	An offence against s 178BB, Crimes Act as in force in February and March 2008 certainly would constitute “serious crime related activity” according to that definition. Mr Spark’s affidavits of 15 April 2009 and 7 November 2013 are thus sufficient to establish that the Second Defendant’s interest in the Carlingford property is an interest to which subs (1A)(a) of s 22 applies. It follows that under sub (2) the Court “must make an assets forfeiture order … if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that [the Second Defendant] was at any time not more than six years before the making of the application [that is, before 17 December 2013], engaged in … (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more”.
	
	
	Therefore, the sole issue with respect to the forfeiture order is whether the Court should be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Second Defendant committed an offence against s 178BB(1), Crimes Act in making her St George Bank loan application in February and March 2008. By the operation of s 28C(5) there is no reason why the Court should not make both the forfeiture order and the proceeds assessment order, as sought by the Plaintiff, if the statutory prerequisites for both are established. Nor would the making of the forfeiture order be required to be taken into account in assessing the amount to be paid under the s 22 proceeds assessment order: New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelaita [2008] NSWCA 284; (2008) 75 NSWLR 564.  At the time of that decision the substance of s 28C(5) was enacted as s 27(6).
	


Legal basis of s 27 proceeds assessment order


	
	So far as relevant to the present case s 27 of the Act provides:
	


“27 Making of proceeds assessment order

(1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) or (2A).

(2) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:

(a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or

(b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.”


	
	The Plaintiff relies upon par (b) of subsection (2) of s 27. Again for the purposes of this section the Plaintiff’s case rests upon the provision of the false tax returns to St George Bank in February 2008 as constituting a breach of s 178BB(1) and therefore a “serious crime related activity”. This raises for decision the same issue as that identified in [14] above in connection with the forfeiture order which the Plaintiff seeks under s 22.
	
	
	Section 28 provides for alternative ways in which the Court must assess the quantum of a proceeds assessment order under s 27. The Plaintiff has invoked subs (3), as follows:
	


“(3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s expenditure during the period of 6 years before the making of the application for the order, the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities.”


	
	The expression “illegal activity” in the closing words of s 28(3) has the following meaning by definition in s 4(1):
	


“illegal activity means:

(a) a serious crime related activity, or

(b) an act or omission that constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth, or

(c) an act or omission that occurs outside New South Wales, is an offence against the law of the place where it occurs and is of a kind that, if it had occurred in New South Wales, would have been an offence referred to in paragraph (b).”


	
	If the question whether the Second Defendant committed an offence against s 178BB(1) is determined in favour of the Plaintiff then a s 27 proceeds assessment order will follow and it will be necessary to determine the amount of expenditure undertaken by the Second Defendant in the period of six years prior to 15 April 2009 (being the date upon which the summons was amended to claim the s 27 order). It will also be necessary to determine whether any of that expenditure was funded from legitimate sources.
	


Second Defendant’s application for exclusion of property from forfeiture


	
	Also before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed by the Second Defendant on 3 February 2014 seeking an order under s 25(1)(a) excluding her interest in the Carlingford property from the operation of the assets forfeiture order which the Plaintiff seeks. Section 25 relevantly provides as follows:
	


“25 Exclusion of property from restraining order and assets forfeiture order

(1) If an assets forfeiture order:

(a) has been applied for but not made—a person whose interest in property might be subject to the order if made, or

(b) has been made—a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order,

may apply to the Supreme Court for an order (in this section called an exclusion order) excluding the interest from the operation of the assets forfeiture order or any relevant restraining order.

(2) The Supreme Court must not make the exclusion order applied for unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that:

(a) in the case of an order relating to fraudulently acquired property—the interest in property to which the application relates is not fraudulently acquired property or is not illegally acquired property, or

(b) in any other case—the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property.” [Emphasis added].


	
	The Second Defendant relies upon subs (1)(a) and (2)(b). That is, she asserts her interest in the Carlingford property “is not illegally acquired property”. The meaning of that concept is given in s 9 of the Act. Subsections (1) to (3) of s 9 define “serious crime derived property”. Subsection (4) then provides that the meaning of “illegally acquired property” is to be ascertained by the substitution of certain expressions in subsections (1) to (3). The result of carrying out these substitutions is that, for present purposes, the applicable subsections of s 9 are to be read as follows. The phrases which have been substituted are highlighted.
	


“(1) An interest in property is illegally acquired property if:

(a) it is all or part of the proceeds of an illegal activity, or

(b) it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal of or other dealing in illegally acquired property, or

(c) it was wholly or partly acquired using illegally acquired property.

(2) The references in subsection (1) (b) and (c) to illegally acquired property are not limited to illegally acquired property described in subsection (1) (a) but also include interests in property that are illegally acquired property because of a previous operation or previous operations of subsection (1) (b) or (c) or their combined operation.

(2A) Without limiting subsection (1), an interest in property is taken to be wholly or partly acquired using illegally acquired property if it is, or has been, subject to a mortgage, lien, charge, security or other encumbrance wholly or partly discharged using all or part of the proceeds of an illegal activity or illegally acquired property.

(3) Once an interest in property becomes illegally acquired property it remains illegally acquired property even if the interest is disposed of or otherwise dealt with (including by being used to acquire an interest in property), but this is qualified by subsection (5).”


	
	The Court will not have power to exclude the Carlingford property from the assets forfeiture order sought by the Plaintiff unless the Second Defendant has proved it more probable than not that her interest in that property “is not illegally acquired property” within the above definition. This burden of proof will not have been discharged if the Plaintiff should prove that provision of the false tax returns to the St George Bank in February 2008 constituted an offence by the Second Defendant against s 178BB(1). That is for two reasons. First, if that offence occurred it was an “illegal activity” within the definition of that term quoted from s 4(1) at [18] above.
	
	
	Secondly, if the offence was committed then the Second Defendant’s interest in the Carlingford property must be regarded as “proceeds” of that illegal activity”. “Proceeds” is defined in s 4(1) as follows:
	


“proceeds, in relation to an activity, includes any interest in property, and any service, advantage or benefit (including, without limitation, an increase in the value of an interest in property), that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, as a result of the activity:

(a) by the person engaged in the activity, or

(b) by another person if the person engaged in the activity:

(i) intended for the other person to derive or realise (whether directly or indirectly) the interest, service, advantage or benefit, or

(ii) knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the other person would be likely to derive or realise (whether directly or indirectly) the interest, service, advantage or benefit.”

Applying that definition, if the alleged offence against s 178BB(1) occurred then the Second Defendant’s interest in the Carlingford property was “derived …, directly or indirectly, as a result of the [illegal] activity: (a) by the person engaged in the activity …”.


	
	Therefore, the outcome of the Second Defendant’s s 25 exclusion application again turns on the question whether the Court is satisfied that it is more probable than not that she committed the offence. If she did, the property is “illegally acquired” within the definition in s 9(1)(a) and the Court “must not” exclude it.
	
	
	The Second Defendant’s Notice of Motion also seeks a declaration that she is not liable to pay to the Treasurer under a s 27 proceeds assessment order “any monies assessed as the value of proceeds derived from any alleged illegal activities of [the Second Defendant] that took place more than six years before the making of the application by the Plaintiff”. That is, illegal activities that took place earlier than 15 April 2003.
	
	
	There is no legal basis for the Court to make a declaration in those terms or to similar effect. The necessary and sufficient condition for the Court to make a proceeds assessment order is a finding that the Second Defendant “engaged in … a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more” within the period of six years dating from 15 April 2003. If that finding should be made and if a proceeds assessment order should therefore follow, the terms of s 28(3) do not restrict the assessment to amounts derived from illegal activities undertaken during the six year assessment period. If money expended during the six year period cannot be shown to have been unrelated to illegal activity then it is to be counted, albeit that some or all of the illegal activity may have taken place prior to commencement of the six years.
	


Issues


	
	From the above and from the way in which the case has been conducted the contested issues in the proceedings may be stated as follows:
	



	
	whether the Second Defendant committed an offence against s 178BB(1) in February/March 2008;
	
	
	the quantum of expenditure by the Second Defendant during the six years from 15 April 2003 to 15 April 2009 and
	
	
	the proportion if any of that expenditure which was funded from income or from sources unrelated to illegal activity.
	


Background and activities of the Second Defendant and her family


	
	The drawing of inferences relevant to each of the live issues will be affected by findings regarding the background and activities of the Second Defendant, her ex-husband James Sun, their son Andrew Sun and other persons with whom they have had relationships and dealings.
	
	
	James Sun was born 7 September 1946 and is therefore now 69 years old. The Second Defendant was born 21 May 1949 and is approximately 2½ years his junior. They were married in Shanghai, China at some time in the period 1974 to 1976. Their child, Andrew Sun, was born 2 March 1976 and is therefore now aged 39 years.
	
	
	James Sun gave evidence that he first came to Australia in February 1988, before the Second Defendant. His visa expired after six months but he did not depart voluntarily. He was deported to China in October 1988.
	
	
	The Second Defendant arrived in Australia in about 1989. She has resided here since. She was not accompanied by her then husband when she commenced to live in Australia in 1989. He remained in China at that time. The evidence does not show whether their son remained with his father in China or came to Australia with the Second Defendant. He would have been only about thirteen years old when she arrived here. From 1989 the Second Defendant was employed in fairly low skilled capacities, for example as a sewing machine operator and painting T-shirts in clothing factories, over a period which she has variously said was the next nine years or the next fifteen years following her arrival. During those years there was a short interval, in the 1990s, when the Second Defendant lived in Samoa.
	
	
	The Second Defendant has given evidence that in the mid-1990s for one and a half years she lived with her then husband and her son in Fiji and (for the greater proportion of this period) in Samoa. She said that in Samoa the family ran a takeaway food shop. According to the Second Defendant’s evidence they returned from Samoa to Australia in about 1997 and she and James Sun were divorced at about this time. She said that he remarried but subsequently divorced his second wife. Records from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (“Border Protection”) show no movements through Australian ports for either the Second Defendant or James Sun between April 1995 and January 1998.
	
	
	According to James Sun he went to live first in Fiji in 1990 and then in Samoa in 1991. He says that his wife spent only about ten months with him in Samoa on a Tourist Visa, whilst he was living there running the takeaway food business. He asserts that this was in the early 1990s.
	
	
	James Sun claims that his wife subsequently sponsored him to come to Australia, in 1994. It is difficult to see how she could have done this as she apparently did not gain citizenship until 20 August 1997. That appears from a citizenship certificate. The Second Defendant asserts she became a citizen of Australia in 1992. I find that she is wrong about this significant event. James Sun’s recollection of when he separated from and divorced his wife was about 2001.
	
	
	The Second Defendant has lived in Australia from January 1998 through to the present time, with the exception of calendar years 1999 and 2002, for most of which she was in China.
	
	
	After her factory work in Australia the Second Defendant ceased all employment and commenced to receive Commonwealth benefits from Centrelink. She has said that this was from 1998 but, by reference to Centrelink records, it was actually from 2001. In the three calendar years 2001 to 2003 she received over $10,000 per annum from Centrelink. In 2004 and 2005 it was over $12,000 per annum. In 2006 she received $6,826 up until she commenced to operate a brothel in about the middle of 2006.
	
	
	The Second Defendant continued to carry on the brothel business from mid 2006 until 30 May 2009. In it she employed two and sometimes three girls. She gave evidence that the licence for the brothel “was in some other people’s name and I was just doing it in their name”. However it is clear from her personal income tax returns for financial years 2007 and 2008 that she was the proprietor. Those returns attached profit and loss accounts for the business and the Second Defendant returned the profit as her personal income.
	
	
	The returns were prepared by the Second Defendant’s accountant Lei Xu, known as Esther Xu. They were signed by the Second Defendant. The Second Defendant declared her income, being predominantly the profits of her brothel together with some small amounts of interest, at $27,566 for financial year 2007 and $31,092 for financial year 2008. The Second Defendant acted in the capacity of manager, answering the telephone, greeting patrons, obtaining payment in cash or on credit card, keeping the records of the business and cleaning. At times her ex-husband James Sun performed these duties in her place. The brothel was conducted at 327 Belmore Road, Riverwood.
	
	
	The Second Defendant and James Sun resumed cohabitation as man and wife from about 2004 or 2005 and have remained in that relationship to the present. The cohabitation must have been very much intermittent until 22 November 2007 because for most of the time between 2004 and that date James Sun was out of Australia, living in China.
	
	
	Border Protection records show that apart from short visits, apparently to China, James Sun resided in Australia continuously from January 1998 to 29 September 2002. From the latter date he spent substantial periods of time, in blocks of between three months and eighteen months, in China, until 22 November 2007. Since then he has lived in Australia at least up to March 2009, with only short trips to China.
	
	
	Some evidence with respect to the marital relationship of the Second Defendant and James Sun and regarding the dates between which they have lived in Australia or China or the South Pacific has come from examinations of them by a legal representative of the Plaintiff, before a Registrar, pursuant to the Act. The Second Defendant was examined on 23 February 2012 and James Sun on 7 June 2012. Evidence on the abovementioned subjects has also been given by their affidavits filed and read in these proceedings and orally, in cross-examination. Their evidence displays extraordinary variability and inconsistency.
	
	
	From the manner in which the Second Defendant and James Sun were able to give responsive answers, mostly through an interpreter of the Mandarin language but with some short answers in English, I take both of them to be of reasonable intelligence. Such witnesses would be expected to be able to remember, at least to the year, when they were divorced, when they resumed cohabitation, when they ran a business together in the South Pacific, when James Sun remarried, when he divorced his second wife and so on. However the information on these subjects provided on the various occasions referred to above shows significant self contradiction by both witnesses. It also shows marked differences between the recollections of each of them as compared to the other. This is indicative of what I have found to be the high degree of unreliability of both the Second Defendant and James Sun. Even in relation to matters which are uncontroversial from the point of view of the Plaintiff and which have no direct impact upon the issues being litigated, neither the Second Defendant nor her ex-husband appears to have any capacity for accuracy in the recall of events and sequences.
	


The purchase and mortgage of the Carlingford property, February 2008


	
	The Second Defendant has given evidence that in February 2008 she was living with James Sun and their son Andrew in rented accommodation in Canterbury Road, Campsie. At that date she wished to purchase a home and the lease of the Canterbury Road property was to be terminated. It was a lease for which Andrew Sun was the named tenant.
	
	
	The Second Defendant inspected the Carlingford property first. James Sun then also inspected it. According to the Second Defendant’s accountant, Esther Xu, on 20 February 2008 the Second Defendant attended her office in Marrickville and sought her assistance in obtaining a loan for the purchase. In the course of their dealings Esther Xu and the Second Defendant spoke to each other in Mandarin. Esther Xu did not work as a mortgage broker but her accounting and tax agent business had an association with a Mr Frank Chen. He was a mortgage broker with whom Ms Xu shared clients. Mr Chen carried on his business at Kogarah.
	
	
	Having considered the purchase price of the Carlingford property and the size of the home loan which the Second Defendant wished to obtain ($500,000), Esther Xu made a calculation of what income level would have to be demonstrated in order to satisfy the lending requirements of St George Bank. Esther Xu calculated that earnings in excess of $60,000 per annum for the previous two financial years would have to be shown. She was aware, from having prepared in October 2007 the Second Defendant’s tax return for the 2007 financial year, that this requirement could not be met. Taxable income of only $27,566 had been declared.
	
	
	According to Esther Xu, she told the Second Defendant that her income was very low and that she would not, on the basis of it, be able to obtain the loan she sought. After discussion of “the various options”, the Second Defendant agreed that Esther Xu should prepare two false income tax returns, one for each of the 2006 and 2007 years, showing purported earnings sufficient to support the loan application.
	
	
	Immediately following this discussion on 20 February 2008 Esther Xu printed a St George Bank loan application from an electronic form held on her computer. She then wrote in the Second Defendant’s particulars from information provided to her. This included showing the following assets:
	


Savings ANZ $100,993

Gift funds $247,000

Deposit paid $88,000


	
	On the final pages of the application the Second Defendant’s full name and the date, 20 February 2008, were written in. The Second Defendant signed. Esther Xu then requested the Second Defendant to bring to her some additional documents which would be required in connection with the application.
	
	
	The next day Esther Xu prepared false tax returns for the 2006 and 2007 years showing the Second Defendant’s taxable income as $60,449 and $63,895, respectively. The Second Defendant returned on 21 February and signed and dated each of these false returns. On this occasion either the Second Defendant or James Sun provided to Esther Xu the additional documents which she had requested. These included the following:
	



	
	Statement of account of the Second Defendant’s ANZ, Box Hill (Victoria) branch, Access Advantage Account showing a credit balance of $100,993.
	
	
	Two receipts from the sales agent of the Carlingford property showing that the deposit of $88,000 had been paid.
	
	
	A letter from the sales agent stating that rental return from the Carlingford property would be approximately $680 per week.
	
	
	A statement of an account in the name of James Sun at HSBC Burwood branch showing credits of $245,747.83 and US$2,436.45.
	
	
	A statutory declaration purporting to be signed by James Sun stating that he had given “my wife Mrs Xiao Yan Xu $248,000 in cash as an unconditional gift to go towards the purchase of the investment property at Carlingford”.
	



	
	The document from the vendor’s agent concerning rental return on the Carlingford property was required because the loan application had been completed with a box checked to indicate that the usage would be “investment”. This was untrue. As the Second Defendant stated in evidence, the house was being purchased for her and her ex-husband and son to live in. She said it was her intention that her son’s wife would also live there. The misrepresentation about use and occupation of the property was material as the purported projection of rental income would be significant to the borrower’s capacity to service the loan.
	
	
	By affidavit, verifying an annexed statement made to police assigned to the Crime Commission, Esther Xu gave the following evidence:
	


“Both of the incorrect income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 were prepared in my office with [the Second Defendant] present on 21 February 2008. Both tax returns were backdated to show St George Bank that they were prepared in the year they were due to be lodged. I signed and backdated both tax returns. [The Second Defendant] also signed and backdated both returns.

At all times [the Second Defendant] was aware that the 2006 and 2007 income tax returns that supported the home loan application were incorrect, because I had fully explained to her what was happening and she had to agree for the application to proceed.

I prepared and lodged Xu’s genuine 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 income tax returns [2005 and 2006 on 18 June 2008; 2007 on 2 October 2007 and 2008 on a date not disclosed in the evidence]. These taxation returns were prepared with [the Second Defendant’s] knowledge based on [her] business records. I had also explained them fully to her. [The Second Defendant] signed a declaration prior to me lodging the income tax returns with the Australian Taxation Office.”


	
	On being called for cross examination on her affidavit Esther Xu objected to answering questions on the ground that the answers might incriminate her. The procedure in s 128, Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) was followed and the witness was informed she would be granted a certificate under s 128(7). Under cross examination she said that she had expected to receive commission in respect of the loan if it was approved. Her understanding was that St George Bank would pay Mr Chen commission of 0.7% of the principal amount loaned ($3,500) plus GST (a total of $3,850). She expected to (and did) receive from Mr Chen 80% of the amount obtained by him. That is $2,800 plus $280 GST, a total of $3,080.
	
	
	In addition Esther Xu understood that Mr Chen would receive a trailing commission of a certain percentage calculated on the outstanding balance from time to time during the life of the loan. Again GST would be added to this and Esther Xu would receive from Mr Chen 80% of the trailing commission. Esther Xu thought the trailing rate was 0.25% but the St George Bank commission record suggests that the rate actually paid was 0.20%. Trailing commission was paid monthly.
	
	
	After the false tax returns had been prepared and the other documents had been received from the Second Defendant or her husband, Esther Xu took all of this material to Mr Chen. On page 2 of the application he wrote in against the label “base income” the figure of $63,895. He took this from the false return prepared by Esther Xu in respect of the 2007 year. In relation to the Second Defendant’s statement of assets in the form, Mr Chen wrote in against the item “gift funds $247,000” the additional description “from husband”.
	
	
	Mr Chen said, without challenge, that he did not know the income tax returns were false. The evidence did not show whether he knew that other particulars in the application were untrue, such as the ownership of two motor vehicles (which were misrepresented on the document as owned by the Second Defendant) and the purpose for which the house was being purchased (falsely represented as “investment”). No suggestion was put to him in cross-examination that he knew these particulars to be false.
	
	
	Mr Chen lodged the application and supporting documents with St George Bank on 22 February 2008 under cover of a letter from his own office and a checklist. He had not met the Second Defendant or James Sun. He had only dealt with Esther Xu. Before passing on to the St George Bank the loan application and its supporting documents, Mr Chen observed that the statutory declaration of James Sun concerning his purported gift to the Second Defendant of $248,000 was signed but not witnessed. He is a justice of the peace. He completed the document as witness to the signature, although he had not in fact witnessed it.
	
	
	In Esther Xu’s first statement to the Plaintiff’s officers dated 27 April 2009 she did not in terms assert that the Second Defendant was aware of and agreed to the preparation of the false returns for financial years 2006 and 2007. She stated this in a subsequent statement dated 16 June 2010, from which I have quoted at [51] above. The witness’ explanation of this was that what went into each of her statements consisted of answers she gave to the investigators’ questions. She said ""If he didn't ask me, I didn't answer"". After the witness responded to that effect the subject was taken no further in cross-examination.
	
	
	I accept her explanation. The investigators taking Esther Xu's statement were obtaining evidence for their purposes, not hers. It is not uncommon in this situation that investigators may fail to ask a witness a question, the answer to which they subsequently perceive as important. In this case, they returned to the witness to supplement her statement more than a year later. The omission from the first statement of the passages quoted at [51] does not of itself give rise to any doubt about the truthfulness or reliability of that evidence.
	
	
	Esther Xu said in cross examination that she was apprehensive when the investigators came to speak to her. She did not deny her involvement in helping the Second Defendant obtain the loan upon the basis of false information. It is apparent from her evidence that she was aware of her wrongdoing from the outset and was fearful when investigators arrived at her office and questioned her on the subject. I find it quite natural that she should have provided information only in answer to questions asked. The sequence in which material aspects of her evidence have been incorporated in successive statements is no reflection at all on her credibility generally.
	
	
	In the witness box Esther Xu was evidently still nervous and uncomfortable about the fact that her evidence concerned an instance of serious dishonesty on her own part in the course of her professional work. But she was forthright and responsive to the questions. There is no inherent improbability about any of her evidence. She has not materially contradicted herself in any relevant particular in the two witness statements prepared by investigators, in her affidavit in these proceedings or in her oral evidence.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to Esther Xu that she had falsified the two tax returns on her own initiative and without informing the Second Defendant. The motive suggested for this was the derivation of her commission. This is an unlikely scenario. It would have been self-evident to Esther Xu that the loan application and its supporting documents would pass out of her control once they were given to Mr Chen for submission to St George Bank. She could have no way of knowing whether the bank’s loan approval officers might communicate directly with the loan applicant, the Second Defendant, in the course of the approval process. Such communications might include a phone call or a face-to-face meeting with the Second Defendant, either alone or together with the broker, Mr Chen.
	
	
	If the serious misrepresentations in the false tax returns were put forward without the Second Defendant's knowledge, exposure of the fraud would be a very high risk should the bank contact the Second Defendant. Esther Xu would have to have been extremely brazen, foolhardy or desperate to have issued the false returns without the Second Defendant's collaboration. From the content of her evidence, from her manifest appreciation of the seriousness of the issues and from her serious and earnest manner in answering questions she did not give me the impression of being a person who would have been so cavalier as to have taken such an obvious risk of exposure, primarily for the benefit of the Second Defendant, by acting without the Second Defendant's knowledge and agreement.
	
	
	The Second Defendant's evidence was that her first contact with Esther Xu came about not by her attending Esther Xu's office to seek assistance with raising a loan, but by Esther Xu attending at the Second Defendant’s brothel in Riverwood. She said this attendance was unsolicited and that Esther Xu claimed to have heard through Xiang Ying Yu, also known as Annie Yu, that the Second Defendant “was seeking to raise a mortgage"". She deposed that Esther Xu arrived at the brothel and “informed (sic) she could assist me in applying for and raising a mortgage"".
	
	
	According to the Second Defendant, Esther Xu asked many questions during this discussion. She was heavily pregnant at the time. She remained for over an hour. She wrote down the answers to the questions. The Second Defendant was unable to say on what paper or document these answers were written.
	
	
	On the Second Defendant's version of events, she then attended Esther Xu's office the following day and signed a number of documents in a number of places, as directed by Esther Xu. She did not read the documents and was not aware that any of them was a false tax return. The Second Defendant disputed that she had been asked to bring to Esther Xu additional documents. However she accepted that she had been asked to bring and did bring a copy of her driver licence, certificate of citizenship and statement of her Access Advantage Account at the ANZ Bank.
	
	
	The Second Defendant disputed that she had brought to Esther Xu’s office the statutory declaration purporting to be signed by James Sun, stating that he had given to the Second Defendant the sum of $248,000. She admitted that she had provided to Esther Xu the statement of James Sun’s account with HSBC Bank at Burwood (which showed a credit sufficient to cover a gift of $248,000). Despite the Second Defendant’s denials it seems highly likely that Esther Xu would have required the statutory declaration. Her understanding was that where funds were held in the name of another party, if the loan applicant wished to demonstrate that those funds were available to her she needed to prove a gift of them, to the Bank’s satisfaction.
	
	
	The Second Defendant denied that Esther Xu even told her that she needed to demonstrate an earning capacity in excess of $60,000 per annum over the previous two years in order to satisfy St George Bank of her capacity to service and repay the loan. I prefer the evidence of Esther Xu on this. The Second Defendant was questioned about the fact that at a rate of anything over 7% per annum the interest on the proposed borrowing of $500,000, alone, would exceed $35,000, more than the whole of her taxable income as declared for the 2007 financial year. When asked on two occasions how she thought it would be possible to persuade the bank to lend $500,000 in those circumstances she had no satisfactory explanation. She suggested that she had expected her son and ex-husband would “help to pay off the loan as well” but gave no evidence of having understood that that was being communicated to the lender.
	
	
	Esther Xu rejected the assertions that she had found out the Second Defendant was purchasing the property from a third party and that she had attended upon the Second Defendant unsolicited. I do not accept the Second Defendant’s evidence in this regard. She gave no evidence of any prior phone call from Esther Xu to arrange a meeting at the brothel concerning a possible loan application. It would have been a most unbusinesslike approach for Esther Xu to proceed from Marrickville to Riverwood, unannounced, in the hope of confirming that the Second Defendant was indeed the purchaser of a property and that she needed a loan and was willing to have Esther Xu prepare the application. I conclude that the Second Defendant has fabricated this description of the initial contact in order to bolster her account that every aspect of the loan application was undertaken on the initiative of Esther Xu. In that respect, the Second Defendant was at pains to emphasise, repeatedly, in her affidavit and in her oral evidence that she left the whole matter of the loan to Esther Xu and that Esther Xu invited her to do so and said “I’ll arrange everything for you”.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 22(2) and s 27(2) I am comfortably satisfied that it is more probable than not that the Second Defendant concurred in Esther Xu and Frank Chen publishing to St George Bank the tax returns for financial years 2006 and 2007 which she knew to be false in the material particular that they grossly overstated her actual income in those years. I have had regard to s 140(2), Evidence Act 1995 and Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 and Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66; (1992) 67 ALJR 170 in applying the civil standard of proof for the purpose of making findings on this aspect of the case, in particular the findings in this paragraph and the next. I am similarly satisfied that the Second Defendant’s intent with respect to the publication of these false tax returns was to obtain for herself a financial advantage. Namely, the advantage of an advance of $500,000 from St George Bank. The obtaining of a loan constitutes a financial advantage for the purpose of this and similar sections: Elias v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2012] NSWCA 302 at [38]-[48].
	
	
	I reject the Second Defendant’s denials of having knowingly authorised submission of the false tax returns in connection with the loan application. She is a witness unworthy of credit generally (see [42], [74]-[76], [129]-[133] and [135]-[145]) including in relation to this subject. Despite the Second Defendant’s submissions to the contrary I find that the representations about her declared taxable income were self evidently material to the lender, as having a bearing upon capacity to service the loan. The test of materiality is objective and does not depend upon evidence being called from the representee: R v Maslen and Shaw (1995) 79 A Crim R 199. I find that the materiality was well understood by the Second Defendant, upon the basis of Esther Xu’s evidence of conversations with the Second Defendant (which I accept) and on the basis of an inference as to what would be obvious to a businesswoman of reasonable intelligence and common sense in the Second Defendant’s position. The loan appears to have been adequately serviced. No evidence has been led to suggest that St George Bank suffered any disadvantage in consequence of the transaction. The commission of the offence does not depend upon proof of any financial or other loss to the victim: R v Walsh (1990) 52 A Crim R 80. I am satisfied that it is more probable than not that the Second Defendant committed an offence against s 178BB(1) by causing the false tax returns to be submitted to the Bank in support of her loan application.

(8) Two years rent in advance paid from the account of James Sun at HSBC in respect of a proposed new brothel at 15 Bearing Road, Seven Hills, on 11 June 2008 - $193,561.

(9) Contribution paid by the Second Defendant towards development of the proposed new brothel at Bearing Road, Seven Hills, in about June 2008 - $5,000.

(10) Balance of the excess of debits to the St George Bank home loan account, less credits, in the period April 2008 to 15 April 2009 - $1,455.14.

(11) Debits to the Second Defendant’s ANZ Access Advantage Account in the period 19 August 2003 to 9 April 2009 - $56,203.84.

(12) Debits to a Bank of China account in the name of the Second Defendant, between 12 August 2005 and 12 August 2009 - $134.50.

(13) Overseas money transfers effected by the Second Defendant between 16 August 2004 and 25 November 2005 - $13,100.

Total - $1,567,665.06


	
	With respect to each of these items I will consider, first, whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that it constituted “expenditure” by the Second Defendant. In relation to the further issue, whether the source of the funds for each item lay in “income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities” (s 28(3)), the Second Defendant’s case is that many of her expenditures were funded from cash earned by James Sun in China or obtained by him from the sale of property there and physically carried into Australia. I will consider the sources of funds separately later in these reasons; the first question is whether the Second Defendant expended them.
	


Item (1): Deposit of $88,000


	
	Receipts from the vendor’s agent showed that $2,200 of the deposit was paid in cash on 11 February 2008. The balance of $85,800 was paid by cheque on 15 February 2008. With respect to the first $2,200, the Second Defendant has deposed in her affidavit sworn for the purpose of these proceedings that she gave the real estate agent the money. She has not offered any explanation of the derivation of this sum, specifically. She previously said in her examination of 23 February 2012 that it was her husband who had taken the $2,200 to the agent. I reject that and rely upon the affidavit, which I take as a considered admission for the purposes of these proceedings. In the examination she could not recall where the $2,200 came from to pay the sales agent.
	
	
	With respect to the balance of $85,800, this was given to the agent in the form of a bank cheque issued by St George Bank, Riverwood branch, on 14 February 2008. The bank record of the issue of the cheque shows that it was purchased with cash comprising a large number of, mostly, $100 dollar and $50 notes. In her examination on 23 February 2012 the Second Defendant said that this cash had been stored in a safety deposit box at the Bank of China, Haymarket branch. Her claim that she retrieved it from the safety deposit box on 14 February 2008 was refuted by an officer of the Bank of China. The officer deposed that although the Second Defendant had a safety deposit box there was no record of access having been given to it at any date between 26 March 2006 and 25 February 2008.
	
	
	In these proceedings the Second Defendant deposed that she had reviewed the transcript of her examination by the Crime Commission with the assistance of an interpreter and, subject to two corrections not relevant to the $85,800 bank cheque, the transcript was correct. The Second Defendant’s affidavit was sworn on 14 May 2014. The affidavit of the officer from the Bank of China was sworn on 7 July 2014. When cross examined in this Court regarding the purchase of the bank cheque the Second Defendant said she took the cash from her home, which at that time was the rented property in Canterbury Road, Campsie, to purchase the bank cheque at the Riverwood branch of St George Bank.
	
	
	I infer that the Second Defendant gave deliberately false evidence during her examination about withdrawing cash from the deposit box and that she has fabricated this alternative account of where the cash was stored in an effort to overcome the evidence from the bank officer. These are not matters which a person of the Second Defendant’s reasonable intelligence and understanding would forget or about which she would make an innocent mistake. She would remember where she had $85,800 stored in cash and where she had to transport it from and to, in order to buy a bank cheque to pay the deposit for her first and only purchase of a home.
	
	
	On the above evidence I find that the $88,000 is an element of the Second Defendant’s expenditure during the relevant six year period. I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities where the cash came from or was stored, only that the Second Defendant had it on 14 February 2008 and expended it on a bank cheque that day.
	


Item (2): $292,229.93 applied to settle purchase of the Carlingford property


	
	Almost the entirety of Item (2), namely $292,024.09, was drawn from the HSBC (Burwood) account in the name of James Sun on 18 March 2008 and was used to purchase a bank cheque which was applied to the settlement of the contract for the Carlingford property. The bank cheque was in favour of ING Bank (Australia) Ltd, which I infer to have been the vendor’s outgoing mortgage lender. The settlement adjustment sheet for completion of the sale on 19 March 2008 shows that a larger sum was paid on behalf of the purchaser to ING Bank (Australia) Ltd. Namely, $676,693.09. The $292,024.09 was evidently part of this. The balance of the payout to the outgoing mortgagee was by way of cheque from St George Bank drawn down on the Second Defendant’s loan.
	
	
	The payment of $292,024.09 would properly be characterised as expenditure of James Sun rather than of the Second Defendant but for the fact that James Sun gave this sum to the Second Defendant. $248,000 of it was made “an unconditional gift to go towards the purchase of the investment property at Carlingford”, by the terms of the statutory declaration which was provided to Esther Xu on 21 February 2008 and which she forwarded to Mr Chen for provision to St George Bank as part of the supporting documentation for the loan application: see [49], [54].
	
	
	I accept Esther Xu’s evidence that this document, bearing the purported signature of James Sun, was provided to her by the Second Defendant on 21 February 2008. No competing explanation for how this document came into existence and came to be annexed to the loan application has been advanced in the course of evidence. The Second Defendant denied that she provided the document to Esther Xu and claimed she had never seen it until it was shown to her by her solicitors in connection with the present proceedings. I do not accept this. The Second Defendant is a highly unreliable witness and in contrast the manner of delivery and consistency of Esther Xu’s evidence made it entirely credible.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn for the purpose of these proceedings James Sun has said that he does not recall signing the statutory declaration and that it does not contain his writing. Nevertheless he deposed: “I give my wife all of my money because in Shanghai culture the wife takes care of the household including looking after all of the money”.
	
	
	In oral evidence in this Court James Sun was more definite in denying that he signed the declaration. He produced his New South Wales driver licence (a copy of which became Exhibit A) in an endeavour to show that the signature on the disputed statutory declaration was dissimilar to his genuine signature. In fact, the comparison is not definitive and, on the other hand, the signature on the statutory declaration appears quite similar to his signatures on his affidavit.
	
	
	I found James Sun a highly unreliable witness, for the reasons expressed in [42] and for the further reason of his giving quite unbelievable evidence with respect to his employment and earnings in China between 2002 and 2007 (see [146] to [156] below) and regarding the transport of those earnings, in funds converted to Australian currency, to Australia (see [157] to [168] below).
	
	
	I find that the statutory declaration was drawn up by the Second Defendant, by her ex-husband or by someone else on their behalf and that the figure of $248,000 was written on it because that was approximately the credit balance of James Sun’s HSBC’s (Burwood) account at the date the document was presented to Esther Xu. I also find that James Sun gave to the Second Defendant the whole amount of the cheque which, at settlement, was drawn upon the HSBC (Burwood) account, namely, $292,024.09. In oral evidence in this Court the Second Defendant said, when asked where this sum came from to complete the purchase, “My husband gave it to me”. She went on to assert that the money had been at her home in cash. This latter assertion is not correct. The way in which credits to the HSBC (Burwood) account accumulated, to a sufficient credit balance to fund the settlement bank cheque, is described later in these reasons: [123]. The accumulation of the credit balance clearly did not involve a deposit into the HSBC account of cash, from a stockpile at the Second Defendant’s house or from anywhere else.
	
	
	When James Sun was examined on behalf of the Plaintiff before the Registrar on 7 June 2012 he said that he gave the entire amount of $292,024.09 to his ex-wife to enable her to complete the purchase. He said he gave her “about $300,000”. I do not accept his evidence that the source of this money was earnings which he derived in China and which he carried back in cash, with the assistance of others, over numerous trips. However there is no reason to reject his assertion that he gave the money, whatever its true source may have been, to his former wife.
	
	
	In oral testimony in this Court he gave the following answers:
	


“Q. … at page 44 of your examination … at the top of the page, there was a question ‘did you contribute any money to the purchase of that house?’ And your answer was ‘yes’.

A. Interpreter: Basically it’s all my money.

Q. All your money went to purchase the house. Is that right?

A. Interpreter: Yes.

Q. In your examination you said ‘Up to now, I think I’ve given to my current wife about $300,000. Actually, over $200,000’.

A. Interpreter: I never said its $300,000 or $200,000. All money that came here went to her.

…

Q. You are saying you gave all your money to your wife to purchase the Carlingford property.

A. Witness: yeah.

A. Interpreter: yes.

Q. How much do you say that is?

A. Interpreter: All money was mine. The loan was half a million.

…

Q. How much do you now say you gave to your wife in 2008 in connection with the buying of the house?

A. Interpreter: All the money I brought in here put at hers.

Q. How much was it?

A. Interpreter: Around $400,000.

…

Q. Can you just confirm how much you contributed to the purchase of that property?

A. Interpreter: All the money before settlement comes from me.

Q. Are you saying the amount that was paid on settlement, all of that amount came from you?

A. Interpreter: Yes.

Q. The evidence shows that just over $292,000 was paid on settlement for the purchase of that property. Do you understand?

A. Witness: mmm mmm.

A. Interpreter: yes.”


	
	On the basis of these clear acknowledgements from both the Second Defendant and her ex-husband that the sum of $292,824.09 was a gift from him to her for completion of the house purchase, I find that the direct payment of the bank cheque drawn on the HSBC account in James Sun’s name in favour of the vendor’s outgoing mortgagee is properly to be characterised as an expenditure by the Second Defendant of money which had been given to her.
	


Item (3): $497,648 loaned by St George Bank, applied to purchase


	
	The advance of $497,648 to the Second Defendant took place by way of St George Bank making payments at settlement at the direction of the Second Defendant as purchaser and borrower. A cheque for $384,669 went to the vendor’s outgoing mortgage lender, ING Bank (Australia) Ltd. Another cheque for $112,979 went to the vendor. According to ordinary legal concepts this is properly characterised as an advance of the whole $497,648 to the Second Defendant and expenditure on her part by way of the payments which were necessary to complete her purchase.
	


Item (4): Stamp duty of $35,094


	
	$35,094 for stamp duty was paid directly out of James Sun’s HSBC Burwood bank account. He signed a request for a bank cheque to be drawn on that account on 7 March 2008. I will refer later in more detail to the evidence concerning this account but it is sufficient for present purposes to note James Sun’s evidence that the account “contains money my wife gave to my son to pay for stamp duty”. On that basis, it was James Sun who caused the bank cheque to be drawn, the funds upon which it was drawn were the Second Defendant’s and therefore it is an amount of expenditure by her and should be included in the quantification of the proceeds assessment order against the Second Defendant.
	


Item (5): Conveyancing costs, $1,480


	
	The evidence includes a memorandum of costs and disbursements from the Second Defendant’s solicitors in relation to completing the purchase. The amount charged was $1,480 and it may be inferred that this was paid. However there is no evidence to establish by whom or in what manner it was paid. I therefore cannot be satisfied that this amount should be included in the quantification of the proceeds assessment order.
	


Item (6): Home loan repayments, $283,758.65


	
	The total of $283,758.65 has been added up by the Plaintiff’s forensic accountant, Mr Seagrave, from all of the credits shown in statements issued by St George Bank to the Second Defendant concerning her home loan account. The account commenced with a debit balance of $500,000 on 23 March 2008. Presumably the difference between that figure and the sum which had been paid out at settlement on 19 March 2008, a difference of $2,352, was applied to loan fees or other expenses. The Plaintiff has not sought to bring that balancing figure into the summation of the Second Defendant’s total expenditure for the purpose of calculating the amount of a proceeds assessment order.
	
	
	The earliest credit to the Second Defendant’s Home Loan Account at St George Bank was $100,000 paid on 4 April 2008. This sum was transferred from her ANZ (Box Hill) Access Advantage Account. Given that immediate source, the $100,000 must be regarded as expenditure made by the Second Defendant, for the purposes of s 28(3), at the time of it being credited to the St George Home Loan Account.
	
	
	Many other credits to the St George Bank Home Loan Account can be matched to corresponding debits to a Freedom Offset Account in the name of the Second Defendant at St George Bank, Kogarah branch. The total of credits which can be traced to that source is $48,048. I find that credits in that total sum also constitute expenditure by the Second Defendant in the relevant period, as they have been transferred out of a bank account which was in her name and, so far as the evidence shows, under her control and they have been applied in reduction of a debt owed by her.
	
	
	Taking together the two figures referred to in [92] and [93] above, the total of expenditure by the Plaintiff under this heading, which is to be brought to account in quantifying the proceeds assessment order, is $148,048.
	
	
	The following credits to the St George Bank Home Loan Account during the period relevant for quantification of the Second Defendant’s expenditure are not traceable to any bank account or other source under the control of the Second Defendant:
	


 

20 Jun 2008 TELEGRAPH TFR - 15,975.00

20 Jun 2008 TELEGRAPH TFR - 12,995.00

20 Jun 2008 LOAN REPAYMENT - 21,030.00

13 Aug 2008 LOAN REPAYMENT - 42,210.65

20 Aug 2008 BACKDATE 21/08/2008 INWARD D/E - 3,500.00

13 Oct 2008 LOAN REPAYMENT - 40,000.00

Total - 135,710.65


	
	In her examination on 23 February 2012 the Second Defendant was asked to explain these deposits. She asserted that one Li Tong sent the first of them, from China. She could not say why. She had no idea about the others (pp 57-58). In her affidavit read in the present proceedings the Second Defendant deposed that the first two deposits were from Li Tong and that the money “belongs to” James Sun. His affidavit is to the same effect. In oral evidence before me the Second Defendant said the third, fourth and sixth of these transfers came from James Sun. In the absence of bank transfer records, these various assertions are not sufficient for an affirmative finding of where or whom the money came from.
	
	
	The credit of $21,030 on 20 June 2008 was a cash deposit directly to St George Bank. For this and the other credits listed in [95] there is no satisfactory evidence of who may have caused each deposit or transfer to be made. In particular there is no evidence that the Second Defendant was responsible or that the transfers came from a bank account or other funds owned by her or under her control.
	
	
	I cannot be satisfied that any of these credits constituted expenditure by the Second Defendant herself, for the purpose of applying s 28(3). It follows that the only amount of expenditure to be brought into account in relation to credits to the St George home loan is the amount of $148,008 referred to at [94].
	


Item (7): Loan by James Sun to Jack Yu, $100,000


	
	Annie Yu gave evidence on affidavit in the Plaintiff’s case to the effect that she has known the Second Defendant for fourteen years. They first met when the Second Defendant sought a position as receptionist in Ms Yu’s “massage shop” at Ryde. Having regard to the witnesses’ consistent usage of this expression, I infer that the massage shop was in fact a brothel. Annie Yu deposed that in January or February 2008 her brother Zhen Jia Yu, known as Jack Yu, requested a loan of $100,000. Annie Yu says that she contacted the Second Defendant about this and the Second Defendant agreed to lend and did in fact lend “a sum in the vicinity of $100,000”. Annie Yu was cross examined on behalf of the Second Defendant but she was not challenged about this aspect of her evidence.
	
	
	An affidavit of Jack Yu was read by the Plaintiff and he was not cross examined upon it. He annexed to the affidavit a police statement in which he said that in about January 2008 he needed to borrow money to buy a house in Auburn. He said that his sister, Annie Yu “made arrangements for me to borrow some money” and that he thereafter met “a man who was a similar age to myself around Eastwood”. This man gave him $100,000 in cash. Mr Yu claimed to be unable to identify this person. He said that he spent some of the $100,000 on living expenses including rent and that he banked some of it into his ANZ Bank account.
	
	
	I do not accept on the balance of probabilities that any of what Jack Yu has described, as set out in the preceding paragraph, ever occurred. Inherently it is highly improbable that one would borrow $100,000 from a man without ever finding out who he was. Jack Yu has given no evidence of any terms discussed with the man as to when the money was to be repaid or whether it was to bear interest. A borrowing from an unknown stranger with no discussion about such matters is highly improbable.
	
	
	Further, the statement issued by the ANZ Bank in respect of the account into which Mr Yu says he deposited part of the $100,000 does not corroborate his assertions. Between 1 January 2008 and 19 February 2008 the following credits to that account are recorded:
	


01 Jan    Interest - 225.77

29 Jan    Deposit - 6,495.59

15 Feb    Card entry at Eastwood - 25,000.00

15 Feb    Card entry at Eastwood - 647,642.01


	
	There is no evidence to suggest that a deposit of cash would be recorded by the Bank as a “card entry”. The only deposit which could have been in cash is that of $6,495.59 on 29 January 2008. This provides no support for the highly improbable transaction of an unsecured cash loan of $100,000 from an unidentified stranger.
	
	
	The Plaintiff has relied upon the evidence of Annie Yu and Jack Yu as proving that this supposed $100,000 loan came from the Second Defendant and constituted an additional item of expenditure by her which should be added to the quantification of the proceeds assessment order. Apart from the fact that I am not satisfied that $100,000 was ever received into the hands of Jack Yu in January or February 2008, there are two further reasons why I would not add this sum to the quantification. First, if Jack Yu got this money there is not the slightest evidence to show that it came from the Second Defendant. Even if one were to assume that “the man” in Eastwood was either the Second Defendant’s ex-husband or her son, neither that nor any other evidence would show that the money came from the Second Defendant herself.
	
	
	Secondly, the Plaintiff has adduced evidence to show that this sum of $100,000 was repaid. According to Jack Yu’s verified police statement he met “the man” again in Eastwood on 19 February 2008 and with him attended a branch of the ANZ Bank. There, Jack Yu effected a transfer to an account which “the man” nominated. The statement of Jack Yu’s ANZ bank account shows a “card entry at Eastwood” on 19 February 2008 for a debit of $100,000. This appears to correspond with a credit to the ANZ (Box Hill) Access Advantage Account of the Second Defendant on the same day.
	
	
	The fact that this sum was transferred by Jack Yu to the Second Defendant’s ANZ account on 19 February 2008 provides no evidence that the equivalent sum had been advanced from the Second Defendant to Jack Yu at any earlier time. Even if it did, that would deny the characterisation of the original payment as “expenditure”. A short term loan does not fall within the meaning of “expenditure” according to the ordinary usage of the word or its meaning as it appears in the Act.
	


Item (8): Two years rent in advance for a new brothel, $193,561


	
	Shao Ling Wang, known as Linda Wang, is another associate of the Second Defendant who also operated a brothel in 2008. The Plaintiff read her affidavit, wherein Linda Wang deposed that in 2008 she discussed with the Second Defendant taking a lease of a factory unit in Bearing Road, Seven Hills for the purpose of establishing yet another brothel. According to Linda Wang the Second Defendant agreed to provide funds for two years rent in advance on the Bearing Road premises and to incorporate a vehicle, AWX Trading Pty Ltd, to be the lessee and to apply to Blacktown Council for planning approval to conduct a brothel in the leased premises.
	
	
	AWX Trading Pty Ltd was incorporated on 6 June 2008 with Linda Wang and the Second Defendant as equal shareholders in the whole of the issued capital. Linda Wang produced a two page Lease Advice from Bawdens Industrial (whom I take to be the lessor’s agents) in respect of a property at 15 Bearing Road, Seven Hills. This document is undated but it purports to set out particulars of a lease of the property to Linda Wang (not AWX Trading Pty Ltd) for two years commencing 14 June 2008. The use designated for the leased premises is “brothel”.
	
	
	The annual rent stipulated in this Lease Advice is $67,575. A special condition is included, to the effect that the whole two years rent, including GST, plus $38,000 for outgoings (said to be a total of $193,561) must be “paid up-front”. This conflicts with other terms of the Lease Advice such as that a rental deposit of $7,845 is receipted as having been already paid, that one month’s rent is to be paid as bond and that “upon occupying premises after DA approval, Unconditional Bank Guarantee [must be provided] for four month’s gross rental + GST ($31,380)”. It also conflicts with a purported invoice from Bawdens Industrial, produced by Linda Wang and dated 14 June 2008, which breaks up the $193,561 somewhat differently.
	
	
	Linda Wang also produced a lease, stamped and numbered as having been registered, from Whitmoro (Aust) Pty Ltd as lessor to AWX Trading Pty Ltd as lessee. The lease is dated 13 June 2008 and is for a term of two years from 14 June 2008. There is no satisfactory evidence to establish the street address to which this lease relates.
	
	
	Linda Wang deposed that “Susan gave me a cheque for the rent in advance in the sum of $193,561. Susan told me the money had come from her son”. Statements of James Sun’s HSBC (Burwood) Account show that on 11 June 2008 $193,561 was withdrawn and applied to the purchase of a bank cheque in favour of Whitmoro (Aust) Pty Ltd. On Ms Wang’s affidavit evidence, planning approval for the proposed brothel was refused, appeals to the Land and Environment Court and to the Court of Appeal failed and in mid 2010 the lease was terminated. AWX Trading Pty Ltd was then deregistered. The $193,561 paid to Whitmoro (Aust) Pty Ltd would appear to have been lost without benefit to Linda Wang or the Second Defendant, on this evidence.
	
	
	This payment of $193,561 was not expenditure by the Second Defendant but by her husband, James Sun, albeit that he apparently paid the money in the Second Defendant’s interests. It is not to be brought to account in quantifying the proceeds assessment order. Unlike the $292,229.93 considered at [78]-[87], there is no evidence that the payment of $193,561 from James Sun’s account was a gift from him to the Second Defendant.
	


Item (9): Contribution to development of new brothel, $5,000


	
	When examined by counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff before a Registrar on 23 February 2012, the Second Defendant said that her son, Andrew Sun, had paid the $193,561 to Linda Wang for the rental of the premises at Bearing Road, Seven Hills intended to be a new brothel and that in addition the Second Defendant herself had paid $5,000 for some of the expenses of the proposed development. The Second Defendant said that she lost this $5,000, from which I infer that it was not repaid to her in any manner when the new business venture failed.
	
	
	On the basis of these admissions by the Second Defendant I find that she expended the amount of $5,000 in or about June 2008 and that this amount should be included in the quantification of the proceeds assessment.
	


Item (10): Excess debits to St George Bank home loan account, $1,455.14


	
	The Plaintiff’s forensic accountant, Mr Seagrave, has added up all the debits to the Second Defendant’s St George Bank Freedom Offset Account from its inception on 26 February 2008 to 15 April 2009 (ie, to the end of the six year period within which quantification is required to be made for the purposes of a proceeds assessment). The total of those debits is $49,503.14. In respect of the same period Mr Seagrave has added up all credits to the account, which total $48,048. The difference, being $1,455.14 is alleged by the Plaintiff to represent additional expenditure by the Second Defendant out of this account and the Plaintiff seeks to add it to the quantification.
	
	
	This Freedom Offset Account appears to have been used for the sole purpose of making payments to the Second Defendant’s Loan Account in respect of the Carlingford property. The total of the credits, $48,048, is exactly matched by the total of the transfers from this account to the Loan Account, which have been counted as an element of expenditure by the Second Defendant as part of item (6) (see [93] and [94] above). The additional debits to this account, totalling $1,455.14 as calculated by Mr Seagrave, represent, for the most part, periodic service fees payable to the Bank. The amounts constitute expenditures by the Second Defendant and the $1,455.14 should therefore be counted in the quantification of the proceeds assessment order.
	


Item (11): Debits to Second Defendant’s ANZ Account, $56,203.84


	
	Mr Seagrave has analysed the statements for the Second Defendant’s ANZ (Box Hill) Access Advantage Account from 8 August 2003 (after commencement of the six year proceeds assessment period) up to 15 April 2009 (the end of the six year period). All of the debits to that account in the six year period may be taken as expenditures by the Second Defendant, except to the extent that the debits may have been (a) already counted elsewhere or (b) merely transfers to other accounts in her own name. There are two such amounts: the $100,000 transferred to the St George Bank Loan Account on 4 April 2008 (already counted on the basis explained at [92]) and a further $10,020, also withdrawn on 4 April 2008, deposited to another St George Bank account in the Second Defendant’s name.
	
	
	When allowance is made for those two transactions, the remaining total of debits during the six year period, which must be added in to the quantification of the proceeds assessment order, is $56,203.84.
	


Item (12): Debits to Second Defendant’s Bank of China account, $134.50


	
	In relation to an account of the Second Defendant at Bank of China, Mr Seagrave has carried out an exercise similar to that referred to in relation to item (11) above. The figures are much smaller. Within the six year quantification period there were $234.50 of debits to this account, of which $95 was transferred to another account in the Second Defendant’s name and another $5 was subsequently reversed. The balance of debits, $134.50, is properly to be regarded as expenditure by the Second Defendant and included in the quantification.
	


Item (13): Overseas money transfers, $13,100


	
	Within the six year quantification period, on six separate occasions overseas transfers of funds were made in favour of the Second Defendant’s ex-husband. The transfers were to China and the ordering customer was in each case the Second Defendant. These transfers were proved by the tender of a series of reports from AUSTRAC, the Commonwealth agency responsible for monitoring funds flows into and out of Australia. The total of these transfers is $13,100. These are properly characterised as expenditures by the Second Defendant and their total must be included in the quantum of the assessment order.
	


Origins of the expended funds


	
	On the basis of the above findings the amounts expended by the Second Defendant during the six year period which is relevant to the proceeds assessment order are as follows:
	


(1) Deposit. The source of this was cash - $88,000.

(2) James Sun’s contribution at settlement of the purchase of the Carlingford property, from his HSBC (Burwood) account - $292,024.09.

(3) Loan funds applied to completion of purchase of the Carlingford property. The source was the St George Bank mortgage loan - $497,648.

(4) Stamp duty - $35,094.

(6) Repayments by the Second Defendant of the St George Bank Home Loan. Of this total the source of $100,000 was a transfer from the ANZ Bank (Eastwood) Account of Jack Yu of $100,000 on 19 February 2008. The source of the balance of $48,048 was the Second Defendant’s St George Freedom Offset Account, which in turn was funded by credits of an unknown source - $148,048.

(9) The Second Defendant’s contribution to the new brothel project at Bearing Road, Seven Hills. The source of this is not explained on the evidence - $5,000.

(10) Excess debits to the Second Defendant’s St George Freedom Offset Account - $1,455.14.

(11) Debits to the Second Defendant’s ANZ Access Advantage Account - $56,203.94.

(12) Debits to the Second Defendant’s Bank of China Account - $134.50.

(13) Transfers of funds overseas by the Second Defendant to James Sun - $13,100.

Total - $1,136,707.67


	
	It is necessary to determine whether any of the above amounts were “funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities”, so as to be excluded from the quantification of the proceeds assessment under s 28(3). I will consider first the items in respect of which there was specific evidence of a source, leaving until last a consideration of the residue of items which the Second Defendant has claimed were funded from a general pool of Australian currency, said to have been physically carried into Australia from China over several years.
	
	
	With respect to item (2), (the $292,024.09 from James Sun’s HSBC account), when the bank cheque for that amount was drawn on 18 March 2008 there was a credit balance of $299,900.72 in the account. Mr Seagrave has analysed the statements of this account on a “first in first out” basis with the following results. First, on 13 February 2008 $150,000 was deposited to the account from PayPal Australia. Various drawings on the account between 13 February 2008 and 18 March 2008 left a remnant of that deposit, namely $78,516.13, as a constituent element of the credit balance of the account as at 18 March 2008. Secondly, $801.95 for interest was credited to the account on 28 February 2008. Thirdly, on 12 March 2008 $9,000 was transferred to the account from Hao Pu. Fourthly, a further deposit of $150,000 from PayPal was recorded on 14 March 2008. Fifthly, numerous deposits from eBay sales between 14 February 2008 and 17 March 2008 contributed another $53,706.01 to the credit balance standing at 18 March 2008.
	
	
	James Sun has given evidence that although this account was in his name it was actually operated and controlled by his son Andrew. Neither party has adduced evidence from Andrew Sun. The Plaintiff has tendered evidence, admitted without objection, to show that in late 2008 and early 2009 Andrew Sun committed six offences of recklessly dealing with proceeds of crime. A Statement of Facts to which he agreed for the purposes of sentence in January 2011 recorded that he had acquired a large number of Myer Stores gift cards purchased by the fraudulent use of credit cards. The credit cards were tracked to overseas locations including in Turkey and Brazil. The agreed facts showed that Andrew Sun had used the gift cards to purchase multiple units of laptop computers, iPhones, iPads and other goods which he then sold on eBay.
	
	
	When his rented residence at Unit 2, 371 Canterbury Road, Campsie was searched in connection with the investigation of the above mentioned offences, he was found in possession of 240 Myer gift cards with a face value of $14,450, all of which had been purchased using fraudulent credit cards. Eleven notebook computers with a value of $12,375 were also found in the house, these having been stolen on 7 January 2009, two days before the search warrant was executed, from an unattended delivery truck in the Haymarket area.
	
	
	Against this background and in the absence of any evidence from Andrew Sun or from any other person who could explain the credits to the HSBC Burwood Account which funded the bank cheque for $292,024.09 purchased from that account, I am unable to conclude that any part of that sum came “from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity”. Consequently this amount cannot be excluded from the quantification of the proceeds assessment order under those concluding words of s 28(3). The whole of item (2), $292,024.09, is to be included in the proceeds assessment order.
	
	
	The Plaintiff submits that item (3) (the mortgage loan of $497,648 from St George Bank) cannot be excluded as having been funded from a source unrelated to illegal activity because its source was in fact directly related to the Second Defendant making false representations to St George Bank, in contravention of s 178BB(1), Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	I accept the Plaintiff’s submission. This involves a straightforward application of the concluding words of s 28(3) to these facts. Greg James J held to this effect when ordering summary judgment on this issue in a similar case: New South Wales Crime Commission v Elie Akiki (Supreme Court of NSW, Greg James J, 3 December 2002, unreported). Latham J took the same view in New South Wales Crime Commission v Shamaileh [2013] NSWSC 258 at [9]. The whole of item (3), $497,648, is to be counted in the order.
	
	
	With respect to item (6), the first component (being $100,000 from Jack Yu) cannot be excluded under the exempting words at the end of s 28(3). For reasons given at [99] to [106] I am not satisfied that this money represented a sum which had been earlier loaned from the Second Defendant to Jack Yu. That is to say, I reject the only purported explanation suggested on the evidence given in this Court for the source of the $100,000. This sum is therefore unexplained in any way which could bring it within the words of exclusion in s 28(3).
	
	
	In her examination on 23 February 2012 the Second Defendant claimed that this $100,000 had been loaned to her, by a person whose name she could not remember but whose sister was known to her (p 44). She said the loan was arranged by her husband and was paid into her ANZ Access Advantage Account by way of a cheque issued by the lender, drawn on that person’s account with the ANZ Bank (pp 44-47). This appears to be a claim that the $100,000 was loaned to her by Jack Yu, whose sister Annie was known to the Second Defendant as recounted at [99]. The Second Defendant later said expressly that Jack Yu was the lender (p 52).
	
	
	However this contention is not supported by the evidence of either Jack Yu or Annie Yu, both of whom said (equally unconvincingly) that in fact Jack Yu borrowed this sum from an unidentified man connected with the Second Defendant. I reject the Second Defendant’s evidence concerning the $100,000, as given during her examination and summarised in the preceding paragraph. The halting and fragmented course of her evidence on this subject, as seen in the examination transcript, coupled with the inherent improbability of a person whose name she could not initially remember having loaned her $100,000 unsecured to buy her own home, shows this to be another instance of the unreliability of the Second Defendant as a witness.
	
	
	Apart from the $100,000 from Jack Yu already referred to, the source of the other $48,048 of item (6) (being credits to the St George Bank Home Loan Account which can be traced to the Second Defendant’s St George Bank Freedom Offset Account), is identified only by the descriptions of credits to the latter account in the bank statements. They show that deposits were made to it from time to time in round amounts of $5,000. There was also one deposit of $10,000, one of $500 and one of $220. The statements include narrations for some of these deposits suggesting that they came from either James Sun or from Andrew Sun. The deposits were mostly by internet transfer.
	
	
	In her examination on 23 February 2012 the Second Defendant asserted that these deposits to the Freedom Offset Account, in round amounts, were made by either her son or her ex-husband. She said that in each case before Andrew Sun made a deposit to the Freedom Offset Account he was given cash by the Second Defendant, drawn from a stockpile of cash which she accumulated as a result of her husband and others physically moving currency into the country from China (pp 53-56). I reject this evidence. The absurdity and improbability of it is self evident. There could be no reason for a person in the Second Defendant’s position to hoard cash, hand it over to her son from time to time in amounts of $5,000 or $10,000, have him then bank the money to an account under his control and transfer it into her Freedom Offset Account, for the purpose of funding repayment to the St George Bank Home Loan Account. There could be no coherent reason why the Second Defendant would not herself deposit the cash, if she really held any, directly to her Freedom Offset Account or directly to the St George Loan Account.
	
	
	In the absence of any other explanation of the credits to the Freedom Offset Account, I find that their source is simply unexplained. There is therefore no basis for excluding from the quantification of the proceeds assessment order the $48,048 which was drawn out of this account and applied in reduction of the Home Loan Account. The whole of item (6) as quantified in [121], $148,048, is to be included in the amount of the order.
	


Cash carried in from China – the Second Defendant’s evidence


	
	As for the remaining items listed in [121], numbered (1), (4), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13), the Second Defendant has purported to explain the source of funds for these expenditures only by a generalised claim that large amounts of cash were brought into Australia from China by James Sun, by the Second Defendant herself, by Andrew Sun and by others at James Sun’s direction. So far as it has been contended by the Second Defendant that some of this money was from James Sun’s lawful earnings in China, in [146] to [156] below I state my reasons for not being satisfied on the balance of probabilities that significant earnings were ever derived by James Sun in China. But further, the evidence given by the Second Defendant and James Sun that large sums – from any source – were accumulated in cash in Shanghai and then transported to Australia, leaving no record or trace, is inherently highly improbable (for reasons given at [157]-[168]). It is a claim entirely dependent on uncorroborated evidence of the Second Defendant and of James Sun. At every point where their evidence on this topic may be tested against objectively established facts and the probabilities flowing from surrounding circumstances, it is shown to lack credibility.
	
	
	In the examination of 23 February 2012 the Second Defendant gave evidence that some of the cash used to pay the deposit on the Carlingford property in February 2008 was brought in from China by James Sun, in quantities of $10,000 at a time (p 30). Also, James Sun’s mother, father and uncle were said to have travelled to Australia in about 1998 bringing $10,000 each (p 31). The Second Defendant said that a female cousin of her ex-husband, Li Tong, and the cousin’s husband, Lei Chen, brought Australian currency from China in an amount exceeding $30,000 (pp 32-34). Again this was said to have occurred in 1998.
	
	
	The Second Defendant said that some of this cash was derived from her ex-husband “doing business in China, mainly during that period of time” (p 33; see also p 34). Neither the Second Defendant nor James Sun gave evidence to substantiate or particularise any such business. Clearly this could not have been the alleged business of introducing parties to construction projects (see [44]-[49]) because that business is claimed to have been conducted later than 1998. Namely, between late 2002 and late 2007. Between April 1995 and September 2002 James Sun was almost continuously in Australia.
	
	
	Later in the examination the Second Defendant said that some of the money brought in from China in cash had been derived from the sale in about 2002 of a property at Hong Qiao Road, Shanghai, which had been left to James Sun by his father (p 35). The sale price was said to have been “about 400 to 500,000 Chinese Yuan” (p 37). At that time this sum would have converted to about $110,000. The Second Defendant said that this was brought into Australia in cash, $10,000 at a time, by a number of family members, friends and associates (pp 37-39 and 41-42). The money was used, according to the Second Defendant in a “container business” conducted by James Sun (pp 37-38).
	
	
	This evidence even if accepted would contribute nothing towards identifying a legitimate source for the substantial amounts of expenditure during 2008 and 2009 which must be included in the proceeds assessment order unless legal derivation can be demonstrated. The Second Defendant’s examination evidence ends at the point of currency imported from China having been put into the supposed “container business”, without any evidence having been adduced to show that there was such a business or that it generated profits and drawings which could, in turn, explain the expenditure identified in the Plaintiff’s evidence.
	
	
	In her examination the Second Defendant also claimed that James Sun had received money in China from the sale of a property in Kang Ding Road, Shanghai in about 2011 (pp 35-36 and p 49). This does not require further consideration as the point of alleged derivation is too late to provide any explanation for expenditures in the six year period which ended 15 April 2009.
	
	
	In the Second Defendant’s affidavit which was read on the hearing in this Court she deposed that between 12 February 1995 and 11 September 2008 she personally brought cash into Australia from China in a total amount of $67,900. She said that this belonged to James Sun. The dates she quoted are evidently taken from either her passport or the records of Border Protection. The latter show that she entered Australia on 12 February 1995 and on five further occasions after that, before 11 September 2008. The latter was a date of departure from Australia. On this evidence she would have brought in, on average, over $11,000 on each visit.
	
	
	I infer that in deposing to this range of dates the Second Defendant mistakenly thought that 11 September 2008 was another arrival and that she had made seven flights from China to Australia in the period nominated, enabling her to propound the figure of $67,900 as representing an average of under $10,000 each trip. When cross examined she had no satisfactory explanation for how she was able to recall that $67,900 was the amount she brought in, in cash, on a series of flights spread over 13½ years. She had no contemporaneous record of any amount carried on any occasion. She gave evidence of being aware that amounts of currency of under $10,000 did not have to be declared to Customs whereas larger amounts did have to be declared.
	
	
	In cross examination the witness was taken back to an assertion she had made during her examination on 23 February 2012, to the effect that amounts carried by both herself and other family members and associates were brought into Australia “in different batches to avoid paying tax”. On being reminded of this evidence the Second Defendant denied that tax avoidance was a purpose and said that the small individual quantities were “just for convenience”. When asked again about the earlier answer she said that she did not know what tax she had referred to or even which country’s tax. Her prevarication upon these points contributes to my conclusion that her evidence concerning such cash imports cannot be relied upon.
	
	
	The fact that funds were transferred out of Australia to James Sun, upon instructions of the Second Defendant as “ordering customer”, in a total amount of $13,100 in six separate amounts between 16 August 2004 and 25 November 2005 (item (13), considered at [120] above) again makes it highly improbable that over the same period significant amounts of cash would have been carried into Australia, at the behest of James Sun, in amounts calculated to avoid the necessity for declaration. The height of the absurdity of the Second Defendant’s case in this respect was James Sun’s evidence that he carried $9,800 in cash into Australia on 30 November 2005 (undeclared and undocumented). The AUSTRAC records show that the Second Defendant had transferred $4,500 out of Australia to James Sun in China, only five days earlier. The outflow is officially recorded and clearly occurred. It makes the subsequent import of $9,800, supported only by James Sun’s uncorroborated evidence, most improbable.
	
	
	When cross-examined during the hearing in this Court about the contradiction between documented outflows by bank transfer and asserted imports of cash over the same time frame, the Second Defendant said she sent money to China to pay medical expenses for James Sun’s parents, burial expenses for her own mother and wage expenses incurred by James Sun in a construction business. She could offer no explanation why James Sun would not have paid for these things directly himself out of money which both of them claimed he held in China, rather than having cash carried to Australia only to be sent back by telegraphic transfer. The Second Defendant’s inability to reconcile this tension in the evidence is a further reason for rejecting her account of cash having been carried in to Australia.
	


Cash from China – James Sun’s claimed employment in Shanghai


	
	In his affidavit sworn 3 March 2009 James Sun deposed that he studied construction engineering in Shanghai between 1981 and 1984 and received the “Chinese equivalent of a diploma in engineering about 1984”. He deposed that whilst studying for this qualification he worked “as a designer/engineer” with the “Marine and Transportation Bureau of Shanghai”. He continued to work for that employer until he first came to Australia in 1988. His only evidence about what he did between his deportation from Australia in October 1988 and his return here in 1994 is the conduct of the takeaway food business in Samoa.
	
	
	Under examination James Sun said that commencing with his arrival in Australia in 1994 he worked at “dishwashing, cleaning and cooking” for about eight months. After that he was a cleaner for a Chinese airline. Next he worked as a gyprock fixer, in construction. Later again he acted as a “receptionist” in a brothel at Five Dock. Reading the transcript of his examination on 7 June 2012 together with the Border Protection records, it appears that these are the descriptions of work in which he claims to have been engaged between about April 1995 and September 2002.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 3 March 2009 James Sun deposed that after 1999 he returned to work in China as an engineer and that he continued to work there in that capacity up to the date of the affidavit. He deposed that he earns approximately $600,000 Chinese Yuan per annum which on his calculation equates to approximately $150,000.
	
	
	In evidence in this Court James Sun claimed that he worked in Shanghai during the years 2000 to 2006. When the Border Protection records were put to him, he said that in fact he had only commenced working in China from September 2002. From those records, the period in which he could possibly have been working in China would have been 29 September 2002 to 22 November 2007, with some interruptions of up to three months at a time when he was back in Australia.
	
	
	During the examination he described his work in China as: “I’m an engineer. Project management. I was a manger in projects. …the largest project was 32 levels”. In oral evidence given on the hearing of the summons in this court James Sun asserted that his work in China was in the nature of introducing parties who would be involved in infrastructure and building projects, for commission. He claimed that the projects had included renovation of a restaurant and the construction of 30 kilometres of freeway. He said the projects in relation to which he had made introductions in most cases had capital value in the range $1 million to $1.5 million in Australian currency but one project had had a value of $37 million. The commission he received was said to have been 3% or 5% of the capital value in each case.
	
	
	With respect to this employment history, particularly the period of about five years when he was mostly in China (late 2002 to late 2007), James Sun’s conflicting and variable evidence demonstrated his significant unreliability as a witness. The nature of his employment has a bearing upon whether some of the funds which found their way into the Second Defendant’s hands and were expended by her in the period relevant to this case were sourced from his earnings. His inconsistencies about the nature, commencement and duration of his employment coupled with the objective improbability of his account of his work in China leads me to the conclusion that his evidence on this subject is not merely afflicted by poor recollection but involves fabrication.
	
	
	No documentary evidence has been tendered of any tertiary, professional, business or trade qualifications which would suggest that James Sun has any credentials as a project engineer. It is not apparent how he could have taken up such a role in China in 2000, after more than a decade absent from the country and working in unskilled capacities in Samoa and in Australia. No documents have been tendered relating to any of the purported projects to which he refers, such as to demonstrate the nature of them or that they were ever actually undertaken or that he was in any way involved. No documentary evidence nor any affidavit or oral evidence from any independent witness has been provided to confirm that James Sun worked in China in any of the roles which he has nominated. He has no documentary record of any payment received from any third party for working in any such role.
	
	
	He claims to have converted substantial amounts of Chinese currency, which were paid to him for working in the asserted capacities in the period 2002 to 2007, into Australian dollars. But he has not produced a single document recording such an exchange transaction. No evidence has been called from any person who collaborated with him or was associated with him or was introduced by him in connection with any of the projects for which he claims to have derived commission for acting in the nature of broker or introducer. If any of his conflicting accounts of the work that he performed in China in 2002 to 2007 were true, it would be possible for him to obtain an affidavit or call a witness, perhaps by video link from Shanghai, or tender a document to prove that he was engaged as claimed.
	
	
	In order to have acted as an intermediary earning commission from the introduction of principals to carry out substantial building or infrastructure projects, it may be inferred that James Sun would have needed contacts in the relevant industries and that he would have to have been known to operators in those fields who might have used his services for introductions. No evidence has been called to establish that he had any profile in this respect which could possibly have been put to use in deriving commissions in the way he asserts. As a former emigrant returning to China in 2002 after many years’ absence working in unskilled capacities he would not likely have been able to establish himself in this line of work. In view of James Sun’s unreliability as a witness generally I cannot be satisfied of this improbable account in the absence of corroboration.
	
	
	After a full day and part of a second day of cross examination James Sun conferred with the Second Defendant’s counsel over a short adjournment before being re-examined. On returning to the witness box he gave a quite different description of the nature of the work that he had performed in Shanghai, as follows:
	


“Q. … when you say that you were working on commission, can you just explain how the business, the construction business, was operating from your point of view around about that time? How would a project commence and how would you obtain commission in relation to your involvement in a project?

A. Interpreter: My friend’s company, they took on a project and because he is short of staff, so he asked me to look after the project. We agreed that, for example, the total cost – the total amount of the project is $1.5 million, for example, and he would take 10% of that. All the money would be given to me to organise everything in the project such as labour, materials and all the related costs. I look after that. Whatever money was left, that belongs to me. When the project finishes, if there’s leftover money, that belongs to me. The materials, regarding the materials, I would get commission on that, for example, marble, gyprock, not much, lights, everything contains commission, glass walls, everything contains commission and that commission is mine.”


	
	This description of the basis of his remuneration is entirely at odds with that of receiving 3% to 5% on the capital cost of projects, in consideration for having effected introductions. The fact that James Sun has given these two radically different accounts of the one mode of work in which he claims to have been engaged makes it impossible to be satisfied of either of them on the balance of probabilities.
	


Cash from China – James Sun’s alleged transport of cash income


	
	James Sun’s affidavit filed in these proceedings had attached to it a schedule setting out all of the dates on which he entered Australia, between 12 February 1995 and 17 September 2008, with an amount of cash nominated against each date as the amount which he claimed to have carried into Australia on that date. He had no written record of the dates and amounts and purported to nominate the amounts from memory. According to the schedule, only on 22 November 2007 and 16 May 2008 did he bring in an amount in excess of $10,000 and he said that on each of these occasions he declared that amount. However Customs records show that in fact the dates on which cash in excess of $10,000 was declared were 14 June 2008 ($21,000) and 17 September 2008 ($30,000). His purported recollection of amounts carried in, on dates extending back nineteen years before the date of his affidavit, cannot be relied upon.
	
	
	The schedule to James Sun’s affidavit also lists alleged dates of entry into Australia of his former wife, the Second Defendant, nominating amounts which she carried on each occasion. The dates of entry that he has given prove, in each case, actually to have been dates of departure from Australia, according to Border Protection records (with the exception of the first date and one other which is neither a date of arrival nor departure).
	
	
	James Sun’s schedule continues in a similar vein nominating dates of entry of his son, his father, mother, uncle and numerous friends. Given the demonstrable errors of his assertions about arrival dates with respect to his wife and the lack of any record of any sum of money brought in on any occasion other than the two instances when a declaration was made to Customs, these bald assertions in James Sun’s affidavit cannot be given any weight.
	
	
	In oral evidence in this Court James Sun asserted that during the period after 2000 when he worked in China (originally said to have been 2000 to 2006, then September 2002 to November 2007: see [44] and [149]), he received all payments by way of commission in cash in Chinese currency. He said that in Shanghai he converted the currency to Australian dollars from time to time when the rate was favourable, using a private foreign exchange dealer who operated outside the banking system and who visited James Sun by appointment to effect the exchanges.
	
	
	James Sun claimed that the Chinese currency in which he was paid and the Australian currency to which he converted it, over time, was kept at the home in Shanghai of his elderly parents. He said he did not know whereabouts in his parents’ house it was held and did not enquire. From 2006 to 2010 James Sun asserted that he also performed some work for which he received “work payment”, which in the context of the answers clearly refers to wages or salary. He said that he banked his receipts of that nature, in China, but not his commissions.
	
	
	James Sun’s claims that he stored large amounts of cash at his parents’ home and brought from China a significant amount of Australian currency to Australia “in batches” of under $10,000, with the help of family and friends, appears highly unlikely in view of the physical insecurity and the inconvenience involved. He was well aware of the availability of bank telegraphic transfers, of which he availed himself from time to time both for transfers from China to Australia and for transfers in the reverse direction.
	
	
	When asked for an explanation why he had not used the banking system both for holding his funds in China and for moving to Australia the sums which he and others allegedly carried in cash, he gave the following answers:
	


“A. Interpreter: I won’t put it in a bank account.

Q. Why not, Mr Sun?

A. Witness: I don’t know but I still don’t want any – don’t want them anybody know I have -

A. Interpreter: I don’t want people to know I have money.

Q. Why not?

…

A. Interpreter: I want people to think I have a simple life, like an average people’s life. In China if you’ve got lots of money you’ve got trouble.

Q. Who would know that you had your money if you had it in the bank?

A. I said I don’t like it.

Q. But how would anybody know that you had money in the bank if it was your private bank account?

A. Interpreter: Like same thing here. Money are brought in here, I put at home, not in the bank.

Q. You haven’t answered my question. If you put money in the bank in China, how would anybody know that you had it there?

A. Interpreter: There are too many crooks in China. I was tricked into losing money when I tried to exchange money in China.

Q. When.

A. Interpreter: I don’t remember, but it happened.

Q. Why would you be worried about crooks in China if you were bringing it to Australia and could simply take it into the Bank in China and have is transferred by wire to Australia, away from the crooks?

A. Interpreter: What crooks in China?

Q. The crooks you mentioned, Mr Sun.

A. Interpreter: There are too many crooks in China and it’s a personal preference that I don’t like banks. That’s that simple.”


	
	The upshot of these answers is that there was no rational explanation given by James Sun for the way he claims to have dealt with the supposed pool of money. When it was sought to probe his assertion about wishing to maintain privacy, he initially evaded the questions and then contradicted himself.
	
	
	Further, his claim to have been avoiding use of the banking system in China in order to maintain privacy is falsified by other conduct on his part. Between May 2005 and February 2007 he caused to be transferred from the HSBC (Burwood) account in his name to an account at the Bank of China, in China (also in his name), a total of $140,988 over 12 transactions, ranging in size from $37,000 to $1,800. He transferred another $5,000 to the same Chinese account from an unknown source in Australia.
	
	
	In an endeavour to reconcile these transfers with his evidence that he did not like to use the banking system in China, James Sun asserted the HSBC (Burwood) account in his name contained his son’s money and was used for his son’s purposes. He said that his son carried on business in China and needed funds there to purchase goods. As his son did not maintain a bank account in China James Sun transferred the required funds to his own account in China. This purported explanation provides no reconciliation of the contradictions in the evidence. Far from being concerned that “crooks” in China might know how much money he had and might cause trouble for him, he was prepared to transfer substantial money from Australia into an account in his own name in China at a time when he was living and working there. Andrew Sun was present at the hearing in this Court from time to time but he was not called to confirm James Sun’s purported explanation of the transfers from Australia back to China through the banking system.
	
	
	A general consideration tending to contradict James Sun’s claim to have imported into Australia large amounts of cash (the total on the schedule to his affidavit is $504,700 over thirteen years up to 2008) is that a significant purpose of his evidence in this respect was to explain innocently the derivation of his gift of over $300,000 to the Second Defendant towards purchase of the Carlingford property: see [84]-[86]. But $292,024.09 of that gift came from his HSBC (Burwood) Account, the credit balance of which was built up by receipts from PayPal, Hao Pu and Ebay (see [136]) – not from cash deposits flown in from China.
	
	
	I have found James Sun’s entire account of receiving substantial cash payments in China, storing them at his parents’ home, exchanging Chinese for Australian currency by undocumented private foreign exchange dealings and bringing the cash to Australia in amounts of under $10,000, with the assistance of family and friends, incredible. I am not satisfied that any of the items listed in [121] numbered (1), (4), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13) had their source in legitimate income earnings of James Sun in China or in proceeds of the sale of property in China or that any such earnings or proceeds found their way to Australia in the manner he has described. Accordingly, none of these items can be excluded from the quantification of the proceeds assessment order.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	I have resolved the issues stated at [27] as follows:
	



	
	I am comfortably satisfied that the Second Defendant committed an offence against s 178BB(1), Crimes Act in or about February or March 2008, as particularised at [69] and [70].
	
	
	The amount of expenditure by the Second Defendant during the six years from 15 April 2003 to 15 April 2009 was $1,136,707.67 made up of the components listed at [121].
	
	
	I am not satisfied that any part of the said amount expended was funded from income or from sources unrelated to illegal activity, within the meaning of the concluding words of s 28(3).
	



	
	In accordance with these reasons the orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 22, Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 the interest of Xiao Yan Xu, the Second Defendant, in the property comprised in Lot 6 in Deposited Plan 872204 known as 14 Wondabah Place, Carlingford, New South Wales be forfeited to and vest in the Crown.
	
	
	Pursuant to ss 27 and 28(3) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act the Second Defendant pay to the Treasurer the amount of $1,136,707.57.
	
	
	The Notice of Motion filed by the Second Defendant on 3 February 2014 is dismissed.
	
	
	The Second Defendant pay the Plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings insofar as they relate to the Second Defendant.

		12 October 2015",2015-10-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702637,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 12) [2015] NSWSC 1542,"Judgment (on further application by crown for leave to cross-examine a3 under s.38 evidence act 1995 - t1077)


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has this morning sought to reagitate an application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 for leave to cross-examine A3 with respect to what has been described as the “Africa checking” story.
	
	
	Yesterday, I declined to grant leave under s.38 with respect to that issue: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 11) [2015] NSWSC 1541 at [8]-[9].
	
	
	However, the Crown was allowed to refresh the memory of the witness in Court under s.32 Evidence Act 1995 by the playing of the tape, the transcript of which is Exhibit AA, Tab 15. The Crown had been permitted to play that tape for other purposes as part of a grant of leave under s.38.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the answers given by A3 demonstrate unfavourability for the purpose of s.38. Reference has been made to answers given by the witness, in particular after s.38 leave was granted (at T1060 and T1031). Reliance was placed upon two references which preceded the s.38 grant as well.
	
	
	The issue of the “Africa checking” story must be approached upon the basis that the Crown contends that the story is untrue and constitutes a lie which may operate against each of the Accused persons. Counsel for the Accused persons accept that the “Africa checking” story was untrue, although I understand that what will be contended is that it was the product of panic as a story to explain what had happened, although not in a manner which serves to incriminate the Accused persons. Accordingly, the “Africa checking” story is not advanced by anyone in this trial as being the truth.
	
	
	The real issue will be why the “Africa checking” story was advanced, in particular to the extent that any of the Accused persons advanced it or acquiesced in it.
	
	
	The point was reached yesterday (at T1058) where A3, when asked questions after refreshing her memory under s.32, said, by reference to the Africa checking story, that:
	


“There was a lot of panicking and all that sort of thing.”

And:

“It was a shock to everyone's system.”

And:

“In that context this was being said.”


	
	She proceeded to say:
	


“But now the truth is there about symbolic khatna so why all this fuss? I don't understand.”


	
	If allowed leave to cross-examine the witness on the “Africa checking” story, the Crown would press the use of the documents identified in MFI56 (at points 4 and 5), as well as the reference (in point 1) about which some questions have already been asked.
	
	
	Given the point that has been reached in the evidence of the present witness, I am not satisfied that the evidence represents a state of unfavourability to the Crown so as to warrant the grant of leave under s.38.
	
	
	I take into account, as well, the fact that the Crown, if leave was granted, would seek to put before the jury at least one transcript and tape which is not presently in evidence (Exhibit PTK, Tab 32). I emphasise, however, that the Crown already has leave under s.38 to cross-examine on ""khatna"", and the understanding of the witness of the term ""khatna"".
	
	
	To the extent that the witness has, in answering a question about the “Africa checking” story, used the terms “panic” and “shock”, and then added a comment about ""symbolic khatna"", the grant of leave already made to cross-examine about ""khatna"" will permit the Crown to cross-examine further on the answers (at T1058 and T1060). However, I am not persuaded, in particular having regard to s.192 considerations, that taking this witness to other discussions in other conversations on the same topic will advance the position.
	
	
	In my view, the position of the Crown is sufficiently protected if questioning occurs within the parameters of the existing grant of leave. That is the ruling which I make with respect to the Crown's further application.

		17 November 2015",2015-10-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702646,Sciberras v Commissioner of Police New South Wales Police Force [2015] NSWCATAD 206,"Reasons for decision


	
	In February 2014 the Commissioner of Police suspended the applicant’s category A Firearms Licence. This suspension followed a safekeeping inspection on 20 February 2014. Six months prior the applicant’s firearms licence had been made subject to a special condition (concerning not associating with members of an ‘outlaw motor cycle gang’). During an internal review of the imposition of the special condition, on 11 November 2014 the Commissioner’s delegate set aside the special condition and in substitution revoked the Category A firearms licence.
	
	
	In revoking the licence, the Commissioner decided that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence. Whilst the main reason was that the applicant had (and possible continued) to be associated with an outlaw motorcycle gang, and evidence of one instance of a possible breach of the safekeeping provisions, the decision was in contrast to the applicant’s nil criminal / firearms history, and lack of prosecution for any offence. Whilst the Commissioner’s delegate was of the view that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence, the Tribunal finds, for the reasons set out below, that such a finding cannot be supported by the available evidence.
	


Background


	
	The applicant has held a firearms licence since approximately 1991. During that period he has never been charged or convicted of any breaches of the relevant provisions relating to the possession, storage, handling and use of firearms. In addition he has never been convicted of any criminal offences before a Court in New South Wales or Australia. Whilst he has a number of matters on his driving / traffic history of 30 years of driving, none of these matters has required his attendance at Court. The single Court attendance was initiated by the applicant by way of an election to have a traffic matter dealt with at Court. The background to the applicant’s history will be expanded upon later in these reasons.
	
	
	With this official background, of the applicant being an apparent law abiding member of society, the Commissioner of Police identified some information about the applicant (as a result of a police operation). Whilst that information of itself did not result in any enforcement action by police, it did result in the applicant’s details being matched with other police databases, and holdings. As a result of this process (conducted in February 2014), the applicant was identified as holding a firearms licence. Following that identification, an inspection took place on 20 February 2014, which resulted in police seizing the applicant’s firearm and suspending his licence.
	
	
	Whilst police made various observations about the location of the firearms safe key, the grounds for the suspension as provided in the Notice of Suspension notice dated 20 February 2014 was that (the holding of a licence) was not in the public interest. No other reason was provided on the Notice, however the COPS Event dated 20/2/2014 in the open evidence states the following:
	


Police informed SCIBERRAS that they were suspending his Firearm Licence and seizing the shotgun as it was not in the interest of the public for him to be in possession of firearms. This being due to his membership of the Bandido Outlaw Motor Cycle Gang.

The issue of the applicant’s membership or formal association with the relevant outlaw motor cycle gang (OMCG), or as the applicant referred to consistently as a club, at the relevant time of the inspection in February 2014 has been in constant dispute between the parties.


	
	The applicant’s position has consistently been that his (prior) membership of the OMCG is irrelevant to his being a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence when one has regard to his personal circumstances and his unblemished history both in respect of firearms matters, and being a law abiding citizen. In addition the applicant consistently maintained that his formal association with the relevant OMCG ended prior to the inspection. His evidence was that after 15 year membership he had left the relevant OMCG the previous year.
	
	
	The police operation referred to in paragraph 4 (above), involved a review of photographs which police held of the September 2013 Bandidos National Run. It appears that through checking individuals and registration details from those photographs, the applicant was identified. This process was conducted as part of the duties and operational activities of a strike force dealing with the activities of members of Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMCG).
	


The Commissioner’s Review


	
	On 1 August 2014 the Commissioner’s delegate issued a Notice of Special Conditions on Firearms Licence. The specific impetus and timing of this review is unclear. However from the Notice of Special Conditions on Firearms Licence dated 1 August 2014 (which also constitutes the reasons for decision), it appears that a reassessment of the licence occurred due to the data matching by police of holdings from the strike force referred to above, and subsequent analysis of that data having regard to the Firearms Act 1996.
	
	
	The conditions imposed were that:
	


The holder of this licence does not enter the clubhouse or other premises of the Bandidos or any other outlaw motor cycle gang (OMCG). The licensee is not to attend or enter any premises that are frequented by any OMCG.

In the reasons for decision the delegate stated that after reviewing information relating to the applicant’s membership of the Bandidos OMCG, and the advice that the membership had ceased, the 20 years incident free firearms licensing, and complete lack of criminal history, it was appropriate to continue the licence but with conditions.


	
	The Police Commissioner held the view that persons who associate with OMCG members may be a source of public risk in relation to possessing firearms. In the reasons the view was expressed that the conditions ‘would be prudent as a caution to reinforce your awareness of the legitimate public concerns surrounding outlaw motorcycle gangs’. The Notice as issued on 1 August 2014 contained an error, and a subsequent notice in pertinent terms was issued on 6 August 2014.
	
	
	On 20 August 2014 the applicant (through his legal representatives) wrote to the Commissioner of Police advising that they did not accept the conditions on the applicant’s firearms licence and sought a review. Specifically they submitted that the applicant’s interests in motorcycles and his maintenance of that interest by occasionally attending the premises of any motorcycle club was not inconsistent with his other sporting shooting and domestic, occupational and community interests. In addition the applicant made submissions for the unconditional return of his firearms licence, as to do otherwise was ‘an infringement of civil liberties’, the right to ‘freedom of association’, and the ability to ‘exercise the freedoms expected in a democratic society’.
	
	
	On 11 November 2014 a further Statement of Reasons was issued in respect of the review of conditions request. The outcome of the review was that in the absence of conditions, the Commissioner’s delegate determined to revoke the firearms licence in the public interest. The grounds were in summary that in the context of the firearms licencing and regulation statutory regimes, the types of rights submitted by the applicant were overridden by the criteria of the scheme. In summary the Commissioner’s delegate submitted that: ‘The principles and objects of the Act confirm that possession and use of firearms is a privilege, not a right, and that privilege is conditional on public safety.’
	
	
	On 9 December 2014 the application for administrative review was filed with the Tribunal. A number of grounds were contended by the applicant. Two grounds related to the apparent lack of evidence to support the position held by the Commissioner. Ground 4: No evidence has been advanced by the Police to support the revocation of the applicant’s Firearms License on the grounds that it is not in the public interest. Ground 5: No evidence has been advanced by Police to support the revocation of the applicant’s Firearms License on the grounds that it is against the safety of the public. It is in respect of these two grounds that a large majority of the volume of evidence filed by the Respondent related.
	


Respondent’s Evidence


	
	The respondent’s section 58 material was filed on 3 February 2015. A letter from the relevant shooting club (Cecil Park Clay Target Club), relating to the applicant, and produced under summons was tendered and marked Exhibit R1.
	
	
	A copy of material obtained from the Firearms Registry was tendered by the respondent and marked Exhibit R2.
	
	
	Two affidavits / statements were also filed by the respondent and these contained confidential information which was redacted from the copies filed in open session. A signed statement of a Detective Senior Constable ‘CS’ was tendered and marked Exhibit R3. An affidavit of Detective Sergeant ‘BG’ attached to the Task Force was tendered and marked as Exhibit R 4.
	
	
	The respondent also relied upon material tendered in a confidential session under section 75 (5) of the Firearms Act 1996. 
	


The Applicant’s Evidence


	
	The applicant filed an affidavit which he swore 5 March 2015. The affidavit was tendered and marked Exhibit A1.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence at the hearing and was subject to lengthy cross examination by the Respondent. The Tribunal also asked questions of the applicant.
	


The Hearing

Witness 1.


	
	The respondent called Detective Senior Constable ‘CS’. The witness gave evidence in chief concerning the firearms inspection that he carried out on 20 February 2014, and the material recorded in the resulting COPS Event entry. The witness’s evidence was that he inspected the firearms safe and that there was no ammunition near or in the safe. His evidence was that the applicant reached above the doorframe and produced the key to the firearms safe. The firearm was a double barrel shotgun. The COPS event was created from the witness’s memory or recall of the matters that occurred during the inspection. He also gave evidence that in his knowledge the ‘Bad Company’ patch (as worn by club members), identified someone who had previously committed assaults.
	
	
	In cross – examination when asked why he suspended the applicant’s licence, the witness answered that he did so because in his view the applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold such a licence. It was put to the witness that he forgot to ask the applicant about ammunition. It was also put to the witness that there was another locker / safe present in addition to the one in which the shotgun was located. The witness answered that he did not recall seeing another locker or safe. Questions were put to the witness that he went to the applicant’s premises with the intention of suspending his licence and seizing his firearms. The witness denied these propositions.
	
	
	When questioned about the issue of why the witness believed that the applicant was not a fit and proper person, the witness answered that this view was based on the applicant’s associates.
	


Witness 2.


	
	The respondent called Detective Sergeant ‘BG’. The witness gave evidence in chief in respect of his knowledge and expertise of the culture, activities and structures of various outlaw motorcycle gangs. Evidence was given concerning the notion of a ‘one-percenter’ (1%) being the outlaw moniker that members of these OMCG’s attached to themselves.
	
	
	The witness took the Tribunal to the relevant parts of his affidavit evidence which dealt with the Bandidos OMCG. The witness had no specific awareness of the Chapter of the OMCG which the applicant was associated with other than what he had since ascertained. In that regard the witness gave evidence that the ‘Northside Chapter’ was founded in 1998. There were 29 incidents recorded by the respondent, some which in fact pre-dated 1998.
	
	
	In respect of the witnesses general affidavit evidence, the witness advised that he only included Events where there were no court proceedings arising. Where matters did proceed to court, the relevant Court Attendance Notices, Charges, Summons and Facts etc. were provided. The witness gave detailed evidence in the open hearing about his role and knowledge arising from his experience tasked in the Gangs Squad and various strike force and task forces. Much of this witness’s evidence was not subject to any challenge or cross examination, partly due to the general nature of the evidence.
	


Witness 3.


	
	The applicant gave evidence in support of his application before the Tribunal. In evidence in chief he adopted his affidavit. He gave evidence that he currently works as a roofing contractor, and has his own company. His employment occupies 6 days a week of his time. Whilst he attends to his family, his spouse is a full time mother / parent of their children.
	
	
	When asked why he needs a firearms licence and the reason for the proceedings, the applicant’s evidence was that he wishes to re-engage with clay target shooting.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he previously had a licence for automatic weapons in the early 1990’s. When the amnesty came in in 1996 following the legislation and policy amendments following the Port Arthur incidents, he surrendered his automatic weapons.
	
	
	When questioned about the firearms inspection conducted on 20 February 2014, the applicant gave the following evidence. He stated that Witness 1 advised him that police were ‘seizing this gun as you are not a fit and proper person to have a shotgun.’ The applicant further asserted that Witness 1 added that ‘people like you might cut the barrels off and use it.’
	
	
	When the applicant was asked whether witness 1 asked him during the inspection about ammunition, the applicant was adamant that he was not asked. The witness subsequently located ammunition (after the inspection had concluded). His evidence was that over the following days he telephoned to speak to witness 1 about this, and was told that he was ‘not here’. He spoke to an officer named ‘Cook’ at Parramatta Police Station. That officer advised the applicant to surrender the ammunition straight away, and arrangements were made to hand it in at Blacktown Police Station. The applicant was questioned about the number of rounds that he handed in, and gave evidence that he had possessed a ‘re-loading’ machine.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he had retired from the OMCG chapter due to work and family commitments. The ‘Bad Company’ patch was purchased by the applicant. His evidence was that these could be purchased by any ‘full patch’ member. That is they were not exclusively awarded, but available for purchase to help fund the running of the club.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he has a gun safe and next to it is a lockable / locked drawer which houses his ammunition. The key to the gun safe was located on the timber frame of the wall out of sight in a portion that was not gyp-rocked. When asked again about the ammunition the applicant stated that he was positive that witness 1 did not ask him about the ammunition during the inspection.
	
	
	In cross examination the applicant was asked about his work. He confirmed that he worked 6 days a week, and that Sunday was his day off. He confirmed that he had been a member of the Bandidos since about 1999. His oral evidence was that he had retired from the Bandidos in February 2014.
	
	
	The applicant was questioned about where he kept the key to the ammunition safe, and advised that it was in a drawer in his office, which was a separate room to where the items were stored.
	
	
	He was questioned about his gun club membership lapsing (Exhibit R 1), and conceded that he did not tell the Police that his membership had lapsed. The applicant was also questioned about whether he still owns a Harley Davidson Motorcycle. Whilst his evidence was that he owned such a motorcycle, it was a different one to the one that he owned in 1999 as referred to in paragraph 16 of Exhibit A 1.
	
	
	The applicant was asked under cross examination whether the Northside Chapter still exists. His evidence was, ‘maybe, a few of them get together every now and then’.
	
	
	He was questioned about an incident at a Wollongong restaurant in 2011, where rice and beer were being thrown around as referred to in paragraph 19 of Exhibit A 1. The applicant agreed that his employees were acting in a stupid manner and that ‘acting like geese’ was a fair description of the incident. His evidence was that he was not involved in the fracas and in fact paid the bill.
	
	
	In further cross examination the applicant was questioned about incidents involving pizza shops which he owned with his wife / family. A pizza shop in Windsor was firebombed in 2009. He agreed under cross examination that the Cops Event states what occurred. He was questioned repeatedly about not assisting police in the matters relating to his being a victim of crime. The applicant was consistent and gave his evidence in a compelling and resilient manner, notwithstanding rigorous cross examination. His evidence was that he did assist police.
	
	
	He was asked about his involvement and association with the Bandidos OMCG. The applicant’s evidence was that he was no longer active in the Bandidos, he saw and associated with members ‘once in a blue moon’, such as every three months or so.
	
	
	The applicant again gave evidence in response to questions concerning the ‘Bad Company’ patch. He answered that the patch is purely to make money for the Chapter.
	
	
	It was put to the applicant that a fundamental issue in this review was whether he is a member of an OMCG. The applicant gave evidence that he had never seen the rules of the Bandidos, and that in addition he has not or never witnessed the various behaviours arising from that OMCG as referred to in the respondent’s open evidence.
	
	
	Further questions were put to the applicant about the veracity of the information that he had provided the Firearms Registry either directly or indirectly via his various applications, and submission of letter of authorities from landowners / controllers.
	
	
	The applicant was asked a number of questions by the Tribunal, in respect of aspects of his evidence. In respect of his work and free time the applicant was asked about any annual leave. His evidence was that in addition to Sundays, he would take 10 days leave every year which was ‘family time’. He would stay at a resort and take the family with him.
	
	
	In respect of the issue of locating and subsequently surrendering the ammunition, the applicant advised that on the day following the inspection he remembered that the officer (Witness 1) had not asked him about the ammunition.
	


Witness 1 (recalled)


	
	Witness 1 was recalled and asked questions about the ammunition and the inspection. It was put to the witness in cross examination that based on his written and oral evidence he had attended the applicant’s residence with his mind made up. The witness denied these assertions. However as matters relating to the basis or lawfulness of the inspection are not directly relevant to the administrative decision under review, they will not be dealt with by the Tribunal.
	


Confidential Hearing


	
	The matter proceeded to a confidential hearing after the conclusion of the open hearing. Whilst the hearing was sought by the respondent in accordance with section 75 (5) (b) of the Firearms Act 1996, the fact that there was such a hearing was not confidential between the respondent, the applicant and the Tribunal. Due to time constraints it was agreed that the open evidence and submissions would be dealt with first and the closed evidence and submissions on a later date.
	
	
	The section provides:
	


75…

(5) In determining an application for an administrative review of any such decision, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal (and any Appeal Panel of the Tribunal in determining any internal appeal against such a review under the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013):

(a) is to ensure that it does not, in the reasons for its decision or otherwise, disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other information referred to in section 11 (5A) or 29 (3A), and

(b) in order to prevent the disclosure of any such report or other information, is to receive evidence and hear argument in the absence of the public, the applicant for the administrative review and the applicant’s representative.


	
	NOT FOR PUBLICATION Two pieces of confidential evidence were tendered. One was the open / non redacted affidavit of Detective Senior Constable ‘CS’ which was the companion to R 1 and was marked exhibit ‘RC 1’. The other was the open / non redacted affidavit of Detective Sergeant ‘BG’ which was the companion to R 2 and was marked Exhibit ‘RC 2’.

END OF CONFIDENTIAL PARAGRAPHS

Respondents Submissions


	
	The respondent made detailed submissions as to why the applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence. In respect of the narrow consideration (such as basis and criteria for firearms ownership), the respondent’s submission pointed to the apparent evidence of non- compliance. These issues related to the lapsing of the applicant’s gun club membership, alleged failures in timely notifications of changes in circumstances (relating to lapsed permission for recreational / vermin shooting), as well as the respondent’s disputed claims concerning safe storage breaches by the applicant.
	
	
	In summary the respondent submitted that there were four issues for determination. Is the applicant a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence, does the applicant have a genuine reason for holding a firearms licence, has the applicant contravened provisions of the legislation and regulations (without being convicted), and overall, is it in the public interest for the applicant to hold a firearms licence.
	
	
	On the fit and proper consideration the respondent submitted that the case of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 94 ALR 11 was the proper authority, and submitted that fit and proper takes its meaning from its context. Reference was made to various cases which examined the issue in the context of the Firearms Legislation. Reference was made to the case of Constantin v Commissioner of Police [2012] NSWADT 172 and the summary of the relevant authorities as set out in Pobjie v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2008] NSWADT 39 paragraphs 113 – 117 below.
	


Fitness and Propriety

113 The Law - Assessment of whether a person is fit and proper to be the holder of a licence is different from, but related to, an assessment of whether a person is of good repute.

114 In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33; (1990) 170 CLR 321, Chief Justice Mason explained that, at 380:

""The question whether a person is fit and proper is one of value judgment. In that process the seriousness or otherwise of particular conduct is a matter for evaluation by the decision maker. So too is the weight, if any, to be given to matters favouring the person whose fitness and propriety are under consideration.""

Toohey and Gaudron JJ said at 380:

""The expression ""fit and proper person"", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of ""fit and proper"" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.""

115 A person’s fitness is to be gauged in the light the nature and purpose of the activities that the person will undertake. In Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No.2) [1955] HCA 28; (1955) 93 CLR 127 the High Court said (at 156-7):

""The expression ‘fit and proper’ is of course familiar enough as traditional words when used with reference to offices and perhaps vocation. But their very purpose is to give the widest scope for judgment and indeed for rejection. ‘Fit’ (or ‘idoneus’) with respect to an office is said to involve three things, honesty, knowledge and ability ... When the question was whether a man was a fit and proper person to hold a licence for the sale of liquor it was considered that it ought not to be confined to an inquiry into his character and that it would be unwise to attempt any definition of the matters which may legitimately be inquired into; each case must depend upon its own circumstances.""

116 In Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board 20 SASR 70 Walters J said:

""In my opinion what is meant by that expression is that the applicant must show not only that he is possessed of a requisite knowledge of the duties and responsibilities evolving upon him as the holder of a particular licence ... but also that he is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him to be safely accredited to the public ... as a person to be entrusted with the sort of work which the licence entails.""

117 Fitness and propriety are flexible concepts. A consideration of whether a person is fit and proper involves an assessment of their knowledge, honesty and ability in the context of the role they are seeking to undertake. What fit and proper means must be viewed in the light of, ""... the activities in which the person is or will be engaged"": Re Percival and Australian Securities Commission [1993] AATA 196; (1993) 30 ALD 280, at 290. What is fit and proper will depend on the legislative context and the nature of the particular profession, trade or occupation in question: Re Brennan & Australian Casino Surveillance Authority (1995) 38 ALD 794, at 796 paragraph [41]. Thus in Obradovic -v- Commissioner for Fair Trading, Office of Fair Trading (GD) [2006] NSWADTAP 18 the Appeal Panel agreed that a formerly licensed building contractor should have his application for a new licence refused because, despite there being no evidence that he was dishonest or of bad repute, evidence that he had been extremely tardy and intransigent in dealing with customer complaints, and the regulator, when he held a licence, was sufficient to conclude that he was not fit and proper for the role. In that case, as here, the licensing scheme was among other things, designed to protect consumers and to provide them with adequate means of redress against licensed contractors. In Bond the assessment occurred in the context of whether the applicant was a fit and proper person to hold a licence under the Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth).


	
	The respondent submitted that the Tribunal can be satisfied of certain facts based on the evidence it placed before the Tribunal. In addition the respondent submitted that it is reasonable for the Tribunal to reach certain conclusions based on the import of the evidence submitted by the respondent. Those conclusions go to the applicant’s lack of fitness and proprietary, the lack of any genuine reason, and the breaches of the provisions relating to his former licence by the applicant.
	
	
	The Respondent also made various submissions that certain matters could be inferred from other matters. For example assertions were made that the applicant’s extensive history of contravening the road rules is relevant in considering his attitude towards compliance with the law.
	
	
	In respect of the public interest considerations the respondent submitted that the public interest allows a consideration of issues going beyond the applicant’s character to be taken into account. At paragraph 33 of Constantin (on appeal) Constantin v Commissioner of Police [2013] NSWADTAP 16, the appeal panel held that:
	


33.The 'public interest' allows, we consider, for issues going beyond the character of the applicant to be taken into account. These may include concerns in relation to public protection, public safety and public confidence in the administration of the licensing system. In this case the public interest case was a very strong one. The public would, we believe, be quite concerned that a man with a serious history of violence, including violence using weapons, for which he served several years' imprisonment might now be entrusted with a pistol.

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant filed written submissions which focused on the open evidence submitted in the hearing. The case of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond was also relied upon by the applicant in submissions. The applicant submitted that as per that decision, the conduct of the person is an important component in judging whether the person is fit and proper.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the case of Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board  (see paragraph 116 of Pobjie v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2008] NSWADT 39) reproduced above. The submission being that a person’s knowledge duties and responsibilities are the first component in considering whether a person is fit and proper to hold a particular licence.
	
	
	The applicant in submissions refuted the respondent’s contentions that he was still a member of the OMCG. An important point of difference between the parties was that from the applicant’s perspective an OMCG is actually an Outlaw Motor Cycle Club rather than a gang. Notwithstanding the reference in common parlance to ‘Bikie Gangs’ and the use of the term OMCG throughout these reasons, it is conceded that members refer to themselves as members of a Club rather than a Gang, and the use of terms ‘Club House’, ‘membership’ and other references are consistent with a club or association. The term ‘gang’ appears to arise from the unlawfulness of various activities by these groups, and I note that the reference to the term ‘outlaw’ is agreed between the parties, both in these proceedings, and in society in general as a descriptor of these motorcycle groups also known as the ‘one percenters’.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that matters relating to his driving record were broadly irrelevant to this decision and noted that in other cases matters of a traffic nature were only considered in addition to criminal convictions.
	
	
	The applicant refutes all of the respondent’s allegations / assertions in respect of the safe storage requirements / breaches. In respect of the need to have a genuine reason to possess a firearms licence, the lapsed membership of the shooting club should only be seen as a minor issue. The applicant submitted that the lack of any breach notice indicates the minor nature of any infractions.
	
	
	In respect of the public interest grounds the applicant points to there being no evidence to refute the applicant’s evidence concerning current OMCG membership, no evidence to establish any breach of safe storage requirements, and no evidence that he is either a criminal or connected with any criminal activity.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view the central issue for consideration in these proceedings is whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence. The live issue circulating around that issues is (a) whether the applicant is a current member of an OMCG and (b) whether or not he is a current member is he suitable (by being a fit and proper person) to hold a firearms licence. The issue of (b) relates to his ongoing association with members of an OMCG. If it were not for this conceded association, then other than some non- prosecuted matters arising from the firearms inspection of 2014, and some issues about his actual need for such a licence, little material has been advanced against the applicant's holding of such a licence.
	
	
	In more simple terms, when considering the issue of fit and proper the question being considered is 'should associates of OMCG members have a right to legally possess firearms'. Put another way, the question could be phrased as 'are associates of OMCG's fit and proper persons in respect of the meaning of those words in statute'. Additionally is it in the public interest.
	
	
	There were also residual arguments put by the respondent concerning the applicant coming to police attention and being stopped and searched, criminal intelligence, matters relating to criminality directed at the applicant and his business interests, and complaints of a lack of public order in respect of work related incident at a restaurant. In my view these ’residual’ matters add no weight to the respondent’s argument that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to possess a firearms licence, having regard to the evidence given by the applicant. I form the same view in respect of the applicant’s traffic history, in particular noting his evidence at hearing, both oral and written, and having particular regard to the fact that he has not appeared before a Court and had any finding of an offence proven.
	
	
	I also note that when the respondent determined to place conditions on the applicant’s licence, the only issue which might go to the question of ‘fit and proper’ related to his alleged association / membership of the OMCG. In this regard it would appear that the respondent’s only concerns were that a person who remained associated with OMCG members (either formally or informally), was (in the respondent’s view) not a fit and proper person having regard to reading that expression into the objects of the Firearms Act 1996 .
	
	
	However whether that position is sustainable or not, I am still unclear as to what has transpired from an evidence perspective between the making of the proposed conditional licence determination, and the subsequent cancellation / revocation of the licence by way of substituting the previous decision.
	
	
	In the case of Zahra v Commissioner of Police NSW Police Force and NSW Fair Trading [2014] NSWCATAD 211 the Tribunal examined the central issue of fitness and proprietary to hold a specific licence when a person was a member or associated with individuals from OMCG’s. The main difference with that case was that the evidence was that the applicant remained a member of an OMCG. Another important distinction was that the applicant had a criminal history. Whilst that case deals with tattoo industry licencing, in my view it is relevant because of its consideration of fit and proper following evidentiary findings which contrast with the current case. At paragraph 60 the Tribunal found:
	


60.On the material before me, I am satisfied that the Applicant has continued his involvement with the Rebels. He does not dispute this fact but maintains that he is a retired member. The evidence suggests otherwise.

61.[not for publication].

62.[not for publication]

63.It is clear that the Applicant has continued his associations with the Rebels and other club members. He has been permitted to retain his vest and has continued to receive updated patches. He has retained a club tattoo. He has continued to participate in club activities while wearing club colours.

64.I accept that the Applicant has not continued the level of involvement with the Rebels that he had shown in the past. For example he no longer attends regular club meetings. However, this lessened level of participation does not alter the fact of his continued associations. Nor does it alter the fact that he continues to be accepted by the Rebels as a member of the club. This fact is evidenced by the patches that he has received.

65.On the material before me I am satisfied that the Rebels are recognised as an organised crime network and that the club poses a significant threat to the public interest.


	
	The issue of the existence of OMCG’s in our society is a matter which Police and Law enforcement bodies are continually assessing. This process is often carried out (especially in recent years) in the context of legislative considerations by the elected representatives.
	
	
	In New South Wales the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012 remains in force. Relevantly that Act provides for the making of control orders by the Courts preventing individuals from associating with other members of certain entities including some OMCG’s. The relevant entities need to first be declared a ‘criminal organisation’ by the Court on application by the Commissioner of Police. Control orders appear to prevent association between relevant individuals in an attempt to limit the functionality of the entity in respect of any matters (including criminal conspiracy and other related activity). These provisions are similar to consorting provisions which have been enacted and repealed and reintroduced at various times over the last century in New South Wales.
	
	
	Whilst these ‘gang’ provisions have had a somewhat difficult history in the domestic jurisdictions and have been subject to various constitutional challenges with various levels of success, the current provisions referred to above are in force, and in my view provide some legal basis for the general allegations directed at the activities of OMCG’s and their members. However I note that broadly individuals remain at liberty to apply to and join these organisations, and applications for declarations must be substantiated by evidence which satisfies a superior Court. In that regard there is no current legal basis to ‘outlaw’ the existence of certain OMCG or alleged criminal organisations in the same was as some Commonwealth legislation prohibits certain organisations under terror provisions.
	
	
	Whilst the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012 can limit the activities of certain OMCG’s for specific periods, it is not a OMCG ‘dissolution bill’ making such an organisation illegal. However the passing of such legislation provides insight as to how the legislature (and therefore the community) view the broad activities of such entities and their members, even if transgressions are usually dealt with under the criminal law on a case by case basis.
	
	
	In this regard it would seem appropriate that having regard to the objects of the Firearms Act, and noting that the discretion should be exercised in a way which promotes the principles and objects of the Act, that whilst the applicant may be a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence, it seems that it would not be in the public interest for such a licence to be issued without specific conditions.
	
	
	I make a finding that on the available evidence the applicant is no longer a member of an OMCG. I also make a finding that noting the applicant’s complete lack of any criminal record, and any adverse finding concerning the use and safe storage of firearms (on the evidence presented to the Tribunal), the applicant meets the fit and proper person requirement to hold a licence.
	
	
	In contrast, due to the evidence of the applicant’s continued (albeit occasional) association with his former club colleagues, and having regard to the respondent’s evidence in respect of that Club and OMCG’s in general, the question remains as to whether the applicant should be permitted to hold an unconditional licence. In my view having regard to Clause 19 of the Firearms Regulation 2006, the decision to impose licence conditions was appropriate.
	
	
	What is not supported by the evidence is the broad grounds which were relied upon in the decision to revoke the licence due to the non- acceptance of the conditions, on 11 November 2014.
	
	
	However, the appropriate course is that the respondent re-issue the applicant with a licence which imposes the conditions previously proposed by the Commissioner of Police on 1 August 2014.
	
	
	It follows that the correct and preferable decision is to set aside the decision of the respondent dated 11 November 2014, and substitute that decision with a fresh decision in accordance with the orders of the Tribunal.
	


Conclusion


	
	It follows that the orders shall be made in the following manner having regard to the reasons outlined above.
	


Orders


	
	(1) The decision under review is set aside.
	


(2) In substitution the Respondent is to re-instate the applicants licence with the Special Conditions referred to in the decision of 1 August 2014.

(3) Order (2) is contingent on the applicant satisfying the Commissioner afresh of any nominated item in the Table to section 12 of the Firearms Act 1996.

2702656,R v Ortiz; R v Oviedo [2015] NSWDC 364,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Just yesterday I began some remarks on sentence concerning the drug methylamphetamine with these words: “drugs are terrible things”.  That is certainly true. heir effect upon the community of Australia is enormous. Drug users are harmed in terrible ways, so are their families, so are their friends and so are other law-abiding members of the community upon whom crimes are committed so that drug users can fund their addictions. No one who has spent even a short time in the courts of New South Wales could fail to understand the seriousness of offences for which the two offenders appearing for sentence today are to be sentenced.
	
	
	Andres Ortiz and Sergio Oviedo are to be sentenced for their involvement in an attempt to import a very large quantity of the drug methylamphetamine into Australia, 8.532 kilograms in fact, a quantity which is 11 times the commercial quantity under the Criminal Code and thus 11 times the quantity which exposes them to be sentenced to imprisonment for life. By setting such a maximum penalty Parliament has indicated to the Courts and the community just how seriously drug importation cases are to be treated and it is incumbent upon we judges to respond appropriately.
	
	
	It is often said that judges live in ivory towers but we are exposed on a daily basis to the consequences of drug use, drug selling and drug importation, we know more than most people in the community of the awful consequences to human beings which offences of this type bring about.
	
	
	Each offender has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to an offence of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug.
	
	
	The Crown has tendered what it described as an agreed statement of facts. It is not really a statement of facts at all, it is a summary of evidence containing minute details, the effect of which is to disguise rather than illustrate what it is each offender has actually done. There have been recent criticisms of statements of facts of this kind made in superior courts. It is incumbent upon the prosecution, both Commonwealth and State to respond to those criticisms and begin to produce documents which are helpful to sentencing judges, not because it makes our jobs easier but because it reduces the risk of us making mistakes.
	
	
	There are many examples that I could give of unnecessary detail in this statement of facts. Why do I need to know the postcode in Ultimo? Why do I need to know the precise airway bill numbers? Why do I need to know the registration numbers of particular vehicles? Or the precise telephone numbers used by the people involved. The document is an excellent summary of evidence, but a very poor statement of facts.
	
	
	I have done my best to understand what it is that the offenders have done. Although I will of course accept responsibility for any mistakes in what I am about to say, I believe that the responsibility for such mistakes should be shared with the prosecution.
	
	
	The matter came to the attention of authorities in the United States, they intercepted and examined two consignments to be sent to Australia through a DHL parcel delivery service. Tests revealed that contained within a number of charcoal water filter cartridges was methylamphetamine. The total net weight of the substance containing methylamphetamine was just short of 60 kilograms and as I have said the total pure weight was more than eight and a half kilograms.
	
	
	The US authorities removed the charcoal filter cartridges and the methylamphetamine. The wrappings of the packages were sent to Australia where AFP officers reconstructed the packages with new charcoal water filters, of course containing no illegal drugs. They were then delivered by an AFP member posing as a courier to a man by the name of Bedourie. Thereafter it is apparent that the two offenders were involved in the possession of the packages with the intention that they would be delivered to someone else who would presumably extract the methylamphetamine and either distribute the drug or pass it on to someone who would distribute the drug.
	
	
	The role of Mr Ortiz was to take possession of the consignment and hold it until he could deliver it to another person. He was in constant communication with another person who gave him instructions. He organised for other people to collect and transport the consignment including his co‑offender Mr Oviedo. He stored the consignment in his car, then his home and later at other premises. At one stage he obtained the assistance of a third party to open one of the water filters to access the contents. His role was of course very significant. He demonstrated initiative and an ability to make independent decisions as to some aspects of this importation of illegal drugs.
	
	
	Mr Oviedo’s role was more limited. He was engaged by Mr Ortiz to transport the drug and to retain possession of it. His involvement in the operation voluntarily ceased, but not only because he wished to have no more to do with the enterprise. He seems to have had two reasons for wanting no more to do with it, firstly he was going to Melbourne, but secondly intercepted telephone calls reveal a great deal of reluctance on his part. Clearly these offenders were doing this for financial reward, Mr Oviedo said and I accept, that he was to get $4,000 for what he did. Mr Ortiz says that he was going to get less than that, I do not accept that for one moment. He was in this for money, how much I do not know but the level of his involvement and the enormous quantity of pure drug involved suggests that his reward would have been substantial.
	
	
	Both offenders are Columbian citizens. Neither of them appears to have come to Australia with the intention of committing these offences, that distinguishes them from a number of other offenders dealt with by the criminal courts. Often enough offenders come to Australia with the sole intention of committing offences such as these. But I repeat neither offender is in that category.
	
	
	Mr Ortiz is almost 26 years of age. He was raised in Columbia, his parents argued frequently mainly because of his father’s drinking, although since his father reduced his consumption of alcohol the family has become more cohesive. He came to Australia in 2010 in order to study English. When his visa expired he went back to Columbia but returned to Australia in 2011 and has lived here since, even though his visa expired some time ago. He was working in a number of occupations, maintenance, cleaning, construction and removals and has married an Australian. There is material in a psychologist’s report in which Mr Ortiz gives an explanation as to why he got involved in this serious criminal conduct. He told the psychologist that his family had been threatened, that Columbian drug gangs were violent people and thus he felt under pressure to assist other people involved in this importation when they asked him to. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that that is the reason he did what he did. He gave no evidence before me today, so all Mr Boulten can rely on is the hearsay statements in the psychological report. He has not overcome the burden of proof upon him to establish the mitigating feature of duress.
	
	
	It is difficult to understand why Mr Ortiz got involved in such serious criminal conduct. The psychologist postulates possibilities but they are really just speculation. I suppose it could be said that the fact the offender has no previous criminal record, that psychometric testing failed to identify evidence of conduct problems, entrenched criminal tendencies or ongoing substance abuse would support the conclusions the psychologist has reached as to why it was that Mr Ortiz got involved. But it is quite likely that the rewards which he hoped to obtain from offending were a significant factor in him deciding to commit his serious crime.
	
	
	Mr Oviedo in contrast to his co-offender was a drug user for a significant period of time. He told a different psychologist to the one who interviewed Mr Ortiz that he had been a drug addict since he was 14. He came to Australia in an attempt to start afresh, leaving drugs behind him. However he relapsed into cannabis use within a short time of arriving in Australia and has used drugs such as cannabis and cocaine, he said to alleviate distress. He studied and worked in Australia but of course drugs are expensive and so he found himself under financial pressure despite the fact that he had employment. He was unable to ask his family back in Columbia for more money because they had already paid for him to come to Australia and study. In those circumstances he gravitated to friends, also from South America and his drug use escalated. He told the psychologist who interviewed him that when he was offered $4,000 for his role in this enterprise he accepted it thinking “why not”.
	
	
	Both offenders have been in custody since they were arrested on 7 February 2014 and both appear to have made the most of opportunities presented to them in custody to rehabilitate themselves. They both have received positive references from religious authorities in the prisons, they are both working and studying and using their time well.
	
	
	They have both expressed their remorse. Their pleas of guilty are not the only evidence of that but are an important circumstance. The pleas of guilty also reflect a willingness to assist the course of justice. So to reflect that circumstance in each case I will impose upon the offenders a sentence which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	I take into account also that in Mr Oviedo’s case he appears to have been completely frank with the authorities when they interviewed him.
	
	
	Both of them will of course serve their sentences in a foreign country. Not too much can be made of this given that it was their decision to commit these offences in Australia which has led to them being in gaol here. This is not a case where they will both be completely isolated from friends and family but I do take into account that neither of them appear to be fluent in English and in each case they do have family members in Columbia who will be unable to visit them while they are serving their sentence.
	
	
	Of course the principle of parity has a significant role in this sentencing exercise. Neither offender should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose upon him with the sentence I impose upon the other.
	
	
	Here it is important to note similarities and differences. Both men are about the same age. Both men, as I have already mentioned, are doing what they can to rehabilitate themselves in custody. Both men I am satisfied are remorseful for what they have done but their roles were significantly different. It is conceded by Mr Boulten that Mr Ortiz played a more important role than Mr Oviedo. Indeed Mr Ortiz recruited Mr Oviedo. It is apparent that Mr Ortiz was concerned to distance himself from what he believed to be the drugs in order to minimise his risk of detection.
	
	
	Mr Ortiz was a man who gave directions. He received them as well but he was sufficiently high up in the hierarchy that he was able, as I have said before, to make independent judgments and to give directions to other people, in particular Mr Oviedo. Their roles were quite different in fact and is the primary reason for the differences in sentences that I will impose upon each of them.
	
	
	Of course for the reasons which I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence, general deterrence is of prime importance. I need not repeat what I said at the beginning but I will say that the harm that drugs cause entirely justifies lengthy and indeed even harsh sentences being imposed upon those who would seek simply to make money out of such harmful activities.
	
	
	I will just make a few comments about submissions put to me by Mr Boulten for Mr Ortiz and Mr Pontello for Mr Oviedo. I have already mentioned some of the factors raised by them but there are others I should deal with. I am not going to sentence Mr Ortiz as though he was the person who was going to sell the drugs after extracting them from the water filters. His role appears to have been to pass them on to someone who would do that. There were others who were going to do the extraction and distribution of these terrible drugs.
	
	
	Mr Boulten submits that his client was not a drug ‘king-pin’, and refers to the modest circumstances in which he was living. He may not have been a ‘Mr Big’, and no one is suggesting that he was, but his role was big enough. I accept that he does not appear to have been a person who was making money out of drug importation but as I have already mentioned I do not accept that he was to be paid as little as he told police he was to be paid.
	
	
	Mr Boulten made a submission that his client should receive some benefit from the circumstance that the drugs were removed by US authorities rather than Australian authorities. His submission as I understood it was based on the proposition that there was less risk that the drugs would be distributed than if it were the case that this drug importation was only detected by Australian authorities. Whilst I accept the logic of what Mr Boulten says, any difference in sentence because of this circumstance would have to be very modest indeed. It certainly did not affect his client’s moral culpability and the circumstance that the drugs were not actually flown across the Pacific does not significantly affect the risk that they would be distributed.
	
	
	One submission I would like to refer to, that Mr Pontello made, concerned what he described as the offender’s voluntary cessation of involvement. I have already dealt with that to some extent but Mr Pontello did say that that underscored the peripheral nature of his client’s role. Whilst I would not accept the description of the offender’s role as peripheral I do accept that his decision to have no more to do with this enterprise does demonstrate that his role was not essential.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Mr Boulten provided me with what they said were comparative cases. Mr Pontello relied on the authorities provided by the Crown and Mr Boulten. Quite clearly it is important to ensure that sentencing judges are given as much guidance as possible as to the sentence to impose in individual cases. For my part I gain great assistance from the decisions of other courts, in particular appellate courts. Of course each sentence, whether imposed at first instance or on appeal, relates to a particular offence and a particular offender. But judges are capable of working that out and are capable of considering how differences in objective and subjective features from cases considered by other courts affect the sentence to be imposed. I regard the exercise, of considering comparative cases as very important.
	
	
	Consistency in sentencing should be an important aim of any criminal justice system. As long ago as Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 (2 August 1984) the High Court referred to inconsistency in sentencing as a badge of unfairness. Although that case is traditionally thought of as being a case relating to parity, it is actually a case which stands for wider principle that that.
	
	
	I have considered the cases referred to by Mr Boulten and the Crown and relied on by Mr Pontello. There were of course substantial differences between those cases and the two cases before me today but I have noticed them and taken them into account.
	
	
	I impose sentence as follows:
	
	
	In the case of Mr Ortiz I sentence Mr Ortiz to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six years with a head sentence of ten years to date from 7 February 2014 thus the non-parole period will expire on 6 February 2020.
	
	
	In Mr Oviedo’s case I sentence him to imprisonment and set a non-parole period of three years with a head sentence of six years to date from 7 February 2014. His non-parole period will expire on 6 February 2017.
	
	
	It is important that I explain to the two offenders what I have just done.
	
	
	Mr Ortiz would you mind standing up please.
	
	
	I am going to explain to you the sentence I have just imposed. Now I sentence you to imprisonment, your sentence commenced on the day you were arrested, because you have been in custody since then. From the day you were arrested you must do a minimum of six years in gaol and that means that the earliest you can be released is on 6 February 2020. You may not get released on that day, a lot will depend on your performance in gaol and the decision will be made by the Parole Authorities. The most you will be required to spend in custody is ten years from 7 February 2014.
	
	
	Do you understand that Mr Ortiz?
	
	
	OFFENDER ORTIZ: Yes sir.
	
	
	Mr Oviedo your sentence is also dated from the day you went into custody 7 February 2014 and you have to do a minimum of three years before you can be released so the earliest you can get out is 6 February 2017. Again you may not get out then, it will depend on the Parole Authorities whether you get out then or not. But the most you can be kept in custody for is six years from that date you were arrested. Now do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER OVIEDO: Yes sir.

2702659,R v Daves [2015] NSWDC 356,"Judgment


	
	The drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, is well known to sentencing judges as a scourge within the community. It wreaks huge havoc on people’s lives. An example is the offender whom I am sentencing today, Desmond Daves.
	
	
	For that reason Parliament has fixed significant penalties, indeed severe penalties, for those who supply prohibited drugs including the drug methylamphetamine. I am sentencing a man who had in his custody no less than 15 times the trafficable amount of methylamphetamine, or nine times the indictable amount. In addition, police found in the car $65,000 in cash which represented the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	These were two very serious offences. That is obvious by the fact that Parliament has fixed to each of those crimes a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. This is not an assault case with a maximum of five or seven years or even a case with a maximum of ten years. These are indeed very serious offences and Parliament expects judges to take into account the maximum penalty when working out what an appropriate penalty is in a particular case.
	
	
	Judges take into account many other things as well which I will refer to. They need to work out how serious an example the particular offence is that they are sentencing for. It may be far removed from the worst kind of case. These crimes are not the worst kind of case. Judges also need to take into account the personal circumstances of the offender and I have been assisted by a lot of evidence about the personal circumstances of this offender.
	
	
	The offender’s name is Desmond John Daves. He is now 55. I am sentencing him for the two crimes that I referred to. The first is supplying a prohibited drug less than the commercial quantity. It was just over 45 grams of methylamphetamine, or ice. That is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Parliament, as I said, has fixed to it a maximum of 15 years imprisonment as the penalty. The other offence that I am sentencing him for is knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. That is an offence against s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Again, Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that offence.
	
	
	Mr Daves has signed a document asking me to take into account, when I am sentencing him for the drug supply, two other less serious drug offences. One is the supply of the prohibited drug cocaine. Police found about six grams of cocaine on him when they arrested him. The other is possessing a prohibited drug; namely, cannabis. He had about 10 grams of cannabis on him. I will, in sentencing him for these offences, take into account those offences and I certify to that effect in a document under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Judges should always start with a brief account of what happened to amount to the crime, so that the judge can make an assessment of how serious an example the crime is.
	
	
	Police saw Mr Daves and someone else speeding along the Oxley Highway near Summerton. He was travelling between 140 and 150 kilometres an hour. Understandably the police officer pulled him up, Mr Daves appeared to be nervous -
	


“[H]is voice was shaking and his hands were shaking. The offender’s skin was pale, he had a brown substance around the sides of his mouth, he was sweating (it was a cold morning), he appeared groggy, he spoke slowly and his pupils were dilated.”

The police officer searched the car. He found glass crack pipes. He was arrested and the car was taken to the Tamworth Police Station. They found the cocaine and the cannabis. In addition they found “a set of digital scales, a white plastic spoon and a resealable bag containing hundreds of small resealable plastic bags.” They found cash in the tyre well of the car, which totalled $65,000. That led to the charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. They also found five plastic containers with a total of 45.27 grams of methylamphetamine. The purity of the methylamphetamine was some 74%. That represents the charge of supplying a prohibited drug, which I am sentencing Mr Daves for.


	
	If I have not formally done so, I now convict Desmond Daves of the two offences that I am sentencing him for.
	
	
	A judge will also be interested in an offender’s criminal record. In this case Mr Daves, who is 55, does have a criminal record. It started with some very minor offences when he was under 18. I place no weight on those whatsoever. When he was quite young or relatively young he has a couple of offences of cultivating a prohibited plant and possessing a prohibited drug. The most recent of those earlier ones was 1992. I also disregard those.
	
	
	In 2005 Mr Daves was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. Neither could have been so serious because at Penrith Local Court he received a good behaviour bond. He was convicted of drink driving in 2013.
	
	
	Significantly, Mr Daves has a record in Queensland. He spent some time in Queensland. In 2007 he was convicted of possessing dangerous drugs as well as assault and spent some time in gaol in Queensland. So he comes before the Court with a record from 2007 of possessing a dangerous drug. On the other hand, he does not have a criminal record for supplying a prohibited drug, which is the offence that I am sentencing him for.
	
	
	I have some material about Mr Daves’ personal circumstances in various forms. One is a pre-sentence report prepared by a Community Corrections officer. It provided some helpful background about Mr Daves. It noted that he had developed chronic back pain over the last ten years or so and has gone onto a disability support pension. He admitted to the Community Corrections officer that he had a drug abuse problem and his lifestyle since 2005 until his arrest “became extremely chaotic.” He commenced a methadone program on 16 November 2013 which was, I am told, partly related to his drug habit but more significantly related to his back pain. He acknowledged a gambling problem from many years ago and his partner told the Community Corrections officer that she has seen him winning upwards of $100,000 on one night.
	
	
	Mr Daves gave an account of what the drugs were doing in the car, saying that the “majority of the illicit substances were intended for himself and his former partner’s personal use.” The author of the report noted a psychological report which I will refer to in a moment which itself identified “mental health issues and an addictive personality trait that may benefit with psychological intervention.”
	
	
	His account given to the Community Corrections officer about the purpose of having the drugs and the source of the money lacked credibility. Fortunately he has been more frank in Court.
	
	
	Mr J Curtis of counsel, who appears for Mr Daves, tendered a bundle of material which included a detailed psychological report from a clinical psychologist, Dr Lisa Patterson-Kane. She too noted some of the matters which the Community Corrections officer had noted. She also noted that Mr Daves “reports a substance use history that was dominated by heavy drug use, particularly methylamphetamine (Ice), cocaine, marijuana and in the past heroin.” Mr Daves reported to the psychologist that he had lost control of his life and was “gambling excessively and dealing drugs to sustain his lifestyle and reportedly the cycle of his dependence deepened.” She noted that he was well aware of his own addictive personality and his need for assistance. She concluded that he presented as being -
	


“extremely unhappy in his current life predicament and remorseful of the actions that have led to it. Mr Daves currently presents with symptoms consistent of an anxiety disorder with depressed mood. From Mr Daves’ recollection of his past mood and functioning it is highly probable that his anxiety disorder has been long standing and that the current features of depressed mood are reactive to his current life situation.”


	
	Dr Patterson-Kane noted the coincidence of anxiety-related issues and substance abuse as being common. They can lead to poor decision making. She thought it “probable that Mr Daves’ decision making at the time of his offences was impaired by the effects of both an anxiety disorder and illicit drug use.” She said that psychological therapy would help to “address both elements of substance abuse and an anxiety disorder as the issues appear significantly interrelated for Mr Daves.” She also thought, interestingly, that he should engage in “some form of meaningful work, within the limitation of his physical capabilities.”
	
	
	I should make the observation that I put very little weight on the reference to his mental health condition affecting his decision making at the time of the offences. That is not because I do not respect the opinion of the psychologist, but because I think it highly likely that people who are addicted and deal in drugs are likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. Were that to be given significant weight in reducing general deterrence, it would be applicable in far too many cases.
	
	
	To his credit since being released on bail after some 89 days in custody, Mr Daves has been getting his life back into order, both personally and so far as his health is concerned. He has been regularly seeing people in Tamworth concerning his drug dependency and his mental health. He is in contact with them by either telephone or in person and there are detailed reports of that regularity which were tendered by Mr Curtis. There are a couple of times, picked up by Ms G Wasilewicz who appears for the Direction of Public Prosecutions, where there is a reference in the notes to “speed in his last urine.” I do not appear to have any tests which confirm that. Indeed on one occasion Mr Daves explained it “by taking speed in prison.” I do notice also there is one instance on 6 November 2013 of “wrong labelling of sample.” What I do take from that is that he is serious about getting his physical and mental health into some order.
	
	
	Mr Daves’ physical health is not good. He has a serious back condition which he himself described as debilitating and which it appears he receives the disability support pension for. It affects the movement of one of his feet.
	
	
	Mr Curtis called his client to give evidence. I referred to Mr Daves trying to get his personal life into order. That has been significantly assisted by his former wife who has returned to live with him and support him, and his daughter. He is receiving admirable support from both of them.
	
	
	Mr Daves said in examination-in-chief that the $65,000 was from selling drugs but also from gambling. He also received support from his brother and his sister-in-law who live in Gunnedah where he lives with his former wife and his daughter. He has been drug-free for two years since he came out on bail and he is getting psychological support in Gunnedah. He expects to get psychological support in the future.
	
	
	Mr Daves has had surgery on the back which he told me about, for a condition which affects his foot, which is foot-drop syndrome. His physical disability is such that recently he has had to go into a wheelchair and indeed, he appears in Court in his wheelchair. He needs support on a daily basis which he receives from his former wife and his daughter.
	
	
	Mr Daves acknowledged his genuine, I accept, remorse for his activities and said that he was more than sad and remorseful he had affected so many people’s lives including friends whom he had given drugs to.
	
	
	Understandably, Ms Wasilewicz in cross-examining Mr Daves focused attention on the intended use of the drugs which he had and the money which he had. He said he had about a month’s supply of drugs in the car and the money was from the drug supplying, but over a long period. Over about a year he had accumulated the funds. He also acknowledged that his gambling is a cash-flow business along with another private business that he had. He did not agree that the $65,000 was the result, probably, of the supply of a significant amount of drugs. He said that because he had accumulated it over a long time.
	
	
	Mr Daves said the way that he operated was that his then partner sold the drugs that he gave to her and she brought the money back. She sold to a selected number of close friends. I repeat, he said that the $65,000 was accumulated over a long period of time.
	
	
	What this displays, and I accept, is that the intended use of the methylamphetamine that he had with him was for distribution even though, I accept, limited within the community. Some of it may have been for his own use but the overall intention was that it should be on-sold, through his then partner, to persons selected in the community. I accept also that a majority of the $65,000 was the result of supplying drugs. It does not really matter over what period of time he was supplying them.
	
	
	These are, I repeat, very serious offences. Mr Curtis also called Sarah Daves, Mr Daves’ daughter. Admirably, despite having two very young sons, she has moved in with her parents at Gunnedah and has been helping her father on a daily basis. His needs are such that she described the circumstances as like having another baby. He cannot walk unassisted. She was the one who took the initiative in getting the wheelchair for him. I accept that his disabilities and his need for a wheelchair are genuine. As Ms Daves said, she acknowledged that it is difficult but they do manage and get the job done.
	
	
	I turn now to the arguments that were put on Mr Daves’ behalf and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Curtis acknowledged that the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest available opportunity. Mr Daves was called for trial on three occasions. It was adjourned for a number of reasons and it was not until August this year that he pleaded guilty to the offences that he is now charged with. I propose to allow a discount of just over 10% in due course on the sentences that I will impose upon him. The discount reflects the fact that the plea of guilty assists the criminal justice system by freeing up lists for trials of other people who defend their cases. When a person acknowledges their guilt early in the piece it receives more benefit. But even a late plea, like Mr Daves has made, will attract some discount and I will indicate that in due course.
	
	
	I accept Mr Curtis’ submission that there is no evidence that Mr Daves was an upper or medium level supplier. He was a street-level supplier. That is consistent with the evidence. Mr Curtis realistically acknowledges that the two sentences should be partially made cumulative. He is right and realistic in making that submission and in due course I will indicate the accumulation and then fix an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	By way of mitigation, Mr Curtis argued that his client has good prospects of rehabilitation. I agree with that submission. The fact that he is getting professional assistance and has such strong personal support point in that direction. Ms Wasilewicz acknowledged as much as well. As a matter of practicality, I also acknowledge that he is unlikely to re‑offend. I think his life is very much focused on his physical and mental recovery at this stage.
	
	
	I take into account the remorse which Mr Daves has expressed. Mr Curtis made submissions about special circumstances which would entitle me to adjust the ratio between a head sentence and the non-parole period and I will do that in due course.
	
	
	Mr Curtis also acknowledged that the objective seriousness of the crimes, at least the drug offence, was in the middle of the range. Ms Wasilewicz agreed and I also agree. He said that Mr Daves was candid in his evidence. I thought he was somewhat defensive, but then he was being cross-examined about his drug supplies and at least he was more forthright in his evidence than he was to the Community Corrections officer.
	
	
	Mr Daves’ sentence, when I impose it shortly, will be backdated to take into account the fact that he has served 89 days in custody and MFI 5 indicates that the sentence should commence on 6 July 2015.
	
	
	Mr Curtis, on behalf of his client, made a submission that I could consider a suspended sentence. A preliminary to a suspended sentence must be that the sentence itself would be two years or less. That is the first decision that has to be made regardless of whether a judge is inclined to suspend the sentence or not. These offences are not such that they warrant a sentence of two years or less. The disability which Mr Daves suffered do not constitute exceptional circumstances for departing from the principle which the Court of Criminal Appeal has made very clear since the judgment of Hunt J, as his Honour then was, in R v Clark (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW),15 March 1990, unrep). His Honour said that “trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence.” There must be exceptional circumstances for not imposing fulltime sentence. I am confident that the Corrective Services Department will be able to manage Mr Daves’ disability.
	
	
	Although Ms Wasilewicz pointed to the pre-sentence report’s assessment of his risk of re-offending being medium, I accept Mr Curtis’ submission that that assessment must be seen in the context of the evidence that I have seen and heard today. I think in light of that evidence that the prospects of re‑offending are not at all high.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the sentences which I should fix in this case. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1 and how serious an example the drug supply of methylamphetamine was in this case, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of five and a half years imprisonment. For the goods in custody - the cash - I would regard an appropriate sentence as being four years imprisonment. However Mr Daves has pleaded guilty to both counts. I will therefore discount the five and a half years imprisonment by a little more than 10% and round it off to four years and ten months imprisonment. I will discount the four year sentence by 10% which would be three years and seven months and round it down to three and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	I would be inclined to accumulate both sentences by eight months so that the total sentence would be five and one half years imprisonment. For a sentence of five and a half years imprisonment the legislation envisages that a non-parole period would be four years and one month. So that Mr Daves, if I were to fix that non-parole period, would be eligible for release in August 2019.
	
	
	However, I accept Mr Curtis’ argument that there are special circumstances for reducing that non-parole period in this case. The special circumstances include his need for medical treatment and his physical disabilities. He will serve prison time harder. I accept that submission made by Mr Curtis. In addition, he will need time in the community to continue the rehabilitation which he has already started.
	
	
	I would therefore regard an appropriate overall non-parole period as being one of two and a half years imprisonment. I would have fixed non-parole periods on the individual sentences which I have indicated which correspond to the same ratio of 30 months to 66 months. I say that for abundance of clarity.
	
	
	I propose to aggregate the two sentences and fix one sentence of five and a half years imprisonment. It will be backdated to commence on 6 July 2015 and it will expire on 5 January 2021. The non-parole period will be two and a half years commencing on 6 July 2015 and it will expire on 5 January 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Daves, I am going to formally sentence you now.


	
	I fix a non-parole period of two and a half years imprisonment. It commenced on 6 July 2015. It will expire on 5 January 2018. The overall sentence is five and a half years in prison. It too commenced on 5 July 2015. The overall sentence will expire on 5 January 2021. The first date on which you are eligible for parole, at the end of your two and a half years in prison, will be 5 January 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to ask Mr Curtis and Ms Wasilewicz to check my calculations. I do not fix or order parole because it is over three years.

CURTIS: Your Honour just said, “eligible for parole 5 January 2015”.

HIS HONOUR: Did I? I apologise. 5 January 2018. 5 January 2018 - that is about two and a half years time, no it is just under two and a half years time. When you have both checked the sums tell me whether I have got it right.

WASILEWICZ: I have no issues with those dates your Honour.

CURTIS: Yes, I have no issue your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: They are correct.


	
	Mr Daves, your overall prison sentence is five and a half years. I have explained my reasons why it is so high. You have committed two very serious crimes, each of them with 15 years maximum imprisonment. Your non-parole period for the sentence I gave you could have been as high as four years and one month; I have reduced it significantly to two and a half years because of your disabilities and your need to keep on your rehabilitation path. You will be eligible for release - the Parole Authority decides that - on 5 January 2018.

2702661,R v Orcher [2015] NSWDC 347,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a young man for the crime of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal. The young man is aged 20 and his name is Twayne Orcher.
	
	
	When he was charged with the offence he pleaded guilty and in due course I will discount the ultimate sentence by 25% because it is agreed that he pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity.
	
	
	The first formal thing I should do is to convict Twayne Orcher of the crime of aggravated break and enter with intent. Then I should formally record that the offence is against s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards it as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that crime.
	
	
	When I am sentencing him, Mr Orcher has asked me to take into account, in the sentence that I fix, three other offences that he has acknowledged his guilt of. Two are larceny from a bottle shop and one is damaging the doors of a bottle shop causing some three and a half thousand dollars damage. I will take those three offences into account and I sign a certificate under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 certifying that I have done that.
	
	
	A judge in sentencing someone needs to first say briefly what happened and then to make some kind of assessment of how serious an example this offence was of that crime. It is convenient to refer at the same time to the three offences that I have just certified that I will take into account, because they occurred at about the same time.
	
	
	It all started in the evening of 2 November 2014. Twayne Orcher with someone else went to a bottle shop at a hotel in Tamworth and helped himself to two bottles of rum. He did not pay and ran away. The rum was worth about a hundred dollars. A few hours later he went back to the same bottle shop. This time he and his companion took a couple of bottles of rum each and ran away again. Their haul on that occasion was about $60. Still not satisfied, they returned close to 2 o'clock the following morning, 3 November 2014. This time they went to the Liquorland bottle shop in the Coles Supermarket complex in South Tamworth. They tried to break into it by throwing bitumen at the glass entrance doors. They were unsuccessful. But the doors were damaged beyond repair and had to be replaced. As I said, it cost a lot of money.
	
	
	Then we get to the crime that I am actually sentencing Twayne Orcher for this afternoon. That happened about an hour later, at about 3 o'clock that same morning. He was with someone at her home in South Tamworth and he told her that he was going to the local service station. He took a bandanna with him as he left. He and another man went to the Coles Express Shell Service Station in South Tamworth. There was one employee on duty as the sole console operator. What Mr Orcher did was to throw “a large rock at the door, smashing the glass panel and going through into the shop narrowly missing” the employee who was on duty there. He saw them both outside and “became afraid and ran in to lock himself in the office.” Fortunately he was in control of the doors and was able to lock them. Not to be deterred Mr Orcher “was kicking at the smashed glass trying to enlarge the opening” that he had previously made with the rock. He was using his leg and when he was trying to pull the remaining glass panel out of the door it fell and hit him on the leg and gashed him badly. He had to run away and ended up in hospital. Police came and arrested him at the hospital.
	
	
	Fortunately for the console operator, and unfortunately for Mr Orcher, the injury stopped him from proceeding any further with his attack on the structure of the service station and his attempt to no doubt get access to the till. Hence he was charged with aggravated break and enter with intent to steal. He did not actually steal, but that was clearly his intention. It was aggravated because he was in company.
	
	
	When Mr Orcher committed this offence he was already on a good behaviour bond for malicious damage to property. After he was arrested he spent some 189 days in custody before being sentenced for another crime by Magistrate Holmes in the Local Court. The sentence for the other crime commenced on 12 May 2015. When I sentence him eventually this afternoon I will need to take into account that 189 days and determine when the sentence I impose should start.
	
	
	Mr P Coady of counsel who appears for Mr Orcher submitted that the offence committed by his client is at the lower end of the range of seriousness for crimes of this type.
	
	
	Ms G Wasilewicz, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledged that it was in the lower edge of the range but pointed out that the console operator was a vulnerable person in the circumstances. I think she is right about that. To my mind the console operator is a person who falls within s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 - a person who was vulnerable because of his occupation. Indeed, “service station attendant” is specifically mentioned in that provision. The services offered by service stations are very important anywhere, but particularly so in the country. It is very convenient for everyone that some service stations remain open 24 hours a day. Here in Australia most of the service stations that remain open are attended by a member of staff. That member of staff is obviously vulnerable, but he or she is there to provide the service or convenience for the public. What Mr Orcher did is aggravated by the fact that he picked on a person who was in that vulnerable position.
	
	
	On the other hand, as Mr Coady said, it was an impulsive offence which had very little planning. Ms Wasilewicz acknowledged that but pointed out that in going to the service station he did not have a lawful purpose in going there. Nevertheless, it seemed to be an enterprise that was decided upon very quickly.
	
	
	An important factor that a judge has to take into account in sentencing anyone is obviously whether or not they have criminal record. Twayne Orcher has a criminal record, even though he is still only 20. He was committing crimes from his teenage years, included aggravated break and enter in company. As an adult, he was breaking into buildings and on one occasion assaulted someone causing actual bodily harm. He has been in gaol as an adult for stealing cars and shoplifting. He received sentences from the Magistrate for those last two crimes. Mr Orcher’s record means that he loses any benefit of leniency that he would otherwise receive for a good or clean record.
	
	
	A judge also needs to take into account, in sentencing a person, personal information about their background. We have information about that from a pre-sentence report and from reports prepared by Juvenile Justice when he was sentenced in the Children’s Court some years ago. The author of the pre-sentence report said this in summary -
	


“Mr Orcher is the product of a disrupted upbringing, during which his mother was murdered. His foster grandmother, whom he continues to respect, apparently did her best to bring some stability into his life, and she regards him as a smart person who is an underachiever.”

The author went onto say that Mr Orcher “needs to address his drug addiction in a meaningful way, if he is to be rehabilitated.” The reference to drug-taking is Mr Orcher’s acknowledgement to the author of the report that before his crimes “he had been using a gram of ice per day at a daily cost of $650, and that the intention was to get money for more ‘ice’.”


	
	The author noted that Mr Orcher, “was medicated as a child for ADHD, but he has not been treated for a mental health problem as an adult. Justice Health confirmed he is not on any medication.”
	
	
	The author assessed Mr Orcher’s risk of re-offending as medium to high and noted that he has not to date responded to supervision within the community or into programs that might help with his drug dependency. He had apparently commenced using cannabis when he was quite a young boy and continued to abuse alcohol to the extent of having blackouts as well as amphetamine and methamphetamine over the weekend. This was a year or two ago. Mr Orcher’s schooling finished in year 8 when he was expelled for behavioural problems. People have been recommending that he get assistance for some time but he has not been taken up the opportunities.
	
	
	Given these reports, Mr Coady realistically acknowledged that his client’s chances of rehabilitation could not be said to be good. At the most it could be said that he had a chance of rehabilitation, particularly because of his young age.
	
	
	We have no current information about Mr Orcher’s mental health condition, as Ms Wasilewicz pointed out. Mr Coady reminded me of the matters set out by Wood J (as his Honour then was) in Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. They are matters relevant when a judge is sentencing an Aboriginal person who has had, as Mr Coady acknowledged in this case, “an appalling upbringing.” I refer in particular to the matters put by Mr Coady in para 19 of his written submissions about his client’s background. I agree that I should see his “drug use and offending conduct” in the context “of his extraordinarily underprivileged background.”
	
	
	Ms Wasilewicz acknowledges the relevance of those matters referred to in the case of Fernando.
	
	
	Both Mr Coady and Ms Wasilewicz acknowledge that there are special circumstances for making the parole period of the sentence that I fix, longer than the usual 25% of the overall sentence.
	
	
	It seems to me, given where the case lies so far as objective seriousness and also in particular Mr Orcher’s age and his background, that an appropriate overall sentence for this offence is four years imprisonment. I will discount that sentence by 25% because of the fact that he pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. Hence the sentence will be three years imprisonment.
	
	
	The non-parole period for a sentence of three years imprisonment would normally be 75% of that term, or two years and three months. I think in this case there are special circumstances for allowing more time on parole, particularly Twayne Orcher’s age and his need to engage in rehabilitation services.
	
	
	I therefore propose to fix a non-parole period of one year and ten months, or 22 months imprisonment. Theoretically I could commence the sentence from 11 February next year when the non-parole period for his current sentence expires, or at least backdate it from date for the 189 days. If I was to backdate it from 11 February, then by reference to MFI 3, the sentence would commence on 6 August 2015. If I was to backdate it from today, the sentence would commence on 26 March 2015. Backdating it from today would therefore mean that he serves no time for the sentences imposed by the Magistrate.
	
	
	I propose to backdate his sentence to commence on 1 July 2015. His sentence of three years will therefore commence on 1 July 2015 and will expire on 30 June 2018. The non-parole period of one year and ten months will commence on 1 July 2015 and expire on 31 April 2017. After that the balance of the sentence, one year and two months, will commence on 1 April 2017 and expire on 30 June 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am going to formally sentence you now - have I made a mistake?

WASILEWICZ: Yes sorry your Honour, I think that your Honour said 31 April; I think you meant 31 March is the expiry of the non-parole period. Or alternatively - I don't think that’s right, I think it should be 31 April to 1 May--

HIS HONOUR: Should be 31 April--

WASILEWICZ: As opposed to 1 April.

HIS HONOUR: No it should be 30 April 17, should it?

WASILEWICZ: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Have I got that right?

WASILEWICZ: Yes it’s 30 April…

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

COADY: --I think your Honour said 31 April.

HIS HONOUR: I did, wrongly, thank you. I am going to sentence you Mr Orcher, you need to stand-up.

OFFENDER: I can't.

COADY: He’s locked in and can't your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You cannot, I am sorry about that. We will fix you.


	
	I fix a non-parole period of one year and ten months. I have backdated that to commence on 1 July this year. So that non-parole period of one year and ten months will expire on 30 April 2017. After that, the balance of your sentence is one year and two months, it commences 1 May 17 and expires on 30 June 18. So your overall sentence is three years. It started on 1 July 15 and your overall sentence finishes on 30 June 18.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Just have a seat for a moment. In fact you can put the thing down again, that is fine. It is three years, so I direct his release on parole do I?

WASILEWICZ: Yes your Honour.


	
	The next formal order I make is that under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I make an order directing the release of Mr Orcher on parole on 30 April 2017. The conditions of his parole are these -
	



	
	that he be of good behaviour;
	
	
	that he notify the Community Corrections Service of any change in his address;
	
	
	that he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so;
	
	
	that he accepts supervision from the Community Corrections office and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions by officers of that service, including referral to alcohol and other drug relapse prevention programs including residential rehabilitation as well as vocational assessment and further education and training.
	



	
	In addition, I recommend to the Commissioner for Corrective Services that Mr Orcher be considered for referral to the Custodial Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment program and or the Ngara Nura Program.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Are there any other orders that I need to make before I explain the sentence to your client?

WASILEWICZ: Your Honour I seek to withdraw sequences 4 and 5.


	
	Leave is granted to withdraw sequences 4 and 5--
	


WASILEWICZ: Sorry 4 and 8.


	
	Four and 8.
	


HIS HONOUR: Any other orders I need to make?

WASILEWICZ: Not from me your Honour.

COADY: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Twayne Orcher, stay seated down there. Just so that you are very clear, you have got your three-year sentence, partly overlaps the one the Magistrate gave you when you blew up at him. I backdated your sentence to 1 July, your overall sentence is three years after that, 30 June 18. You are in gaol from 1 July until 30 April 2017. I have ordered you to be released on 30 April 2017 onto parole and I have made it a condition that you behave yourself on parole - you have got to do that, if you get into trouble then you just go straight back in. If you change your address you have to let them know so they know where to track you down and if you get a notice saying come to Court, you come to Court. All right. The most important part of it is that you let Community Corrections supervise you. Do you understand that? You have had them supervise you before on a behaviour bond?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. They know what they are doing, they are good at what they do. They are very experienced and in particular they are going to help you with drug and alcohol, perhaps vocation, jobs, perhaps education - things like that. Your grandmother reckons you are pretty bright and you do not necessary use all that. All right. She reckons you are pretty bright and you have got a good future. Now Community Corrections are going to help you along towards that future and I am hoping this is the last time you are going to be in Court. You are only 20, you have got a long way to go. Do you understand that? It is over to you. Good luck.

Introduction


	
	HIS HONOUR: In this matter application is made by Steven Bowman, an accused person who was tried before me in June 2015, following upon his acquittal on 10 June 2015 in respect of a charge that he on 31 December 2012 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did drive a motor vehicle namely a Holden Commodore in a manner dangerous to another person, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Kim Barns was occasioned.
	
	
	The application the accused makes is pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967, herein after referred to as ‘the Act’, pursuant to s 2 of the Act. The trial was a trial by judge alone and the judgment that I gave in relation to the matter was published on 10 June 2015.
	
	
	The accused was found ‘not guilty’, hence the jurisdiction to consider an application for a “certificate” under the Act. I indicate from the outset that I am proposing to issue a certificate to the accused.
	
	
	The Crown and the defence appeared before me in August this year, as I just briefly explained to the legal representatives of the parties in court today who were not here on the last occasion, and prepared and produced written submissions which were in agreement as to the legal issues to be applied in relation to the matter. In respect of the application made by the accused, the applicant relies upon evidence in the trial including exhibits, oral evidence and other documents produced through oral evidence to the Court. The prosecution relies upon the material at trial but also relies upon additional material produced and admitted without objection, produced pursuant to s 3A of the Act. I will refer to that material shortly.
	


Relevant legislation and principles to be applied


	
	The Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 relevantly provides at ss 2, 3 of the Act.
	


“s.2 The Court or Judge ….. in any proceedings relating to an offence … punishable … upon indictment may –

… where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted … as to the information then under inquiry ….. grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in s.3 relating to those proceedings.

s.3 (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court …… granting the certificate –


	
	if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and
	
	
	that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances”.
	



	
	Further I am required to have regard to s 3A of the Act which provides;
	


“For the purposes of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under s 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in s 3(1)(a) to all the relevant facts is a reference to:


	
	the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and
	
	
	any relevant facts that the defendant has on the application for the certificate established to the satisfaction of the Court or judge, and
	
	
	any relevant facts that the prosecutor or in the absence of the prosecutor any person authorised to represent the minister on the application has established to the satisfaction of the Court or judge or magistrate that:
	



	
	relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time the decision to institute the proceedings was made, and
	
	
	were (sic) not adduced in the proceedings.”
	



	
	In respect of s 3A as I have already indicated, the learned Crown Prosecutor in the material produced to the Court, produced a number of statements identified in the earlier proceedings which have been taken into account.
	
	
	With regard to the principles to be applied in respect of an application made under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, the starting point of the consideration of the application pursuant to the Act is the decision of Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 (particularly at 559G-560B).
	


“… (T)he task of court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, (as set out in s.3(1)(a)). But that question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial, during the trial or afterwards, admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision maker. The decision maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have reasonable to institute the proceedings” (559G-560B) – emphasis added.


	
	The principles to be applied following upon a number of decisions over a period of time from before Allerton up until 2007 were discussed and summarised in the very helpful judgment of McColl JA in Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121 (at [36]). Her Honour in summarising the principles set out relevant considerations to the exercise of the discretion to issue a certificate that followed from her understanding of the operation of the legislation and other decisions prior to that date. (See [36(i)-(xiv)]).
	
	
	There are other judgments which are to be taken into account for example Ramskogler v DPP (1995) 82 A Crim R 128 involved a consideration of appropriate principles in respect of issuing of certificate pursuant to ss 2 and 3 of the Act ( per Kirby P. at [28]).
	
	
	It follows that a judicial officer considering an application pursuant to s 2 of the Act must, firstly, determine what all the relevant facts are, and assume that the Court that was in possession of them, and then determine, if the prosecution had been in possession of those relevant facts before the proceedings were instituted, that it would have been reasonable to institute the proceedings in accordance with the terms of the Act.
	
	
	The written submissions of learned counsel for the applicant identifies the exercise as being one where the Court with all material available to it must then undertake an exercise in hindsight in examining both what is described as the “facts issue” and the issue of the “reasonableness” of the decision to institute the proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to that matter Justice McColl summarised the position in her judgment in Mordaunt by observing that:
	


“The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all the relevant facts whether discovered before arrest or after committal (if any) after committal and before trial, during trial or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the Act (which is the case here). All of the relevant facts proved whether they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial must be considered by the decision maker...the relevant facts include those relevant to the offence as charged and the threshold question posed by s 3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going amongst other things to the question posed by s 3(1)(b) and to the ultimate questions whether assuming the Court is of the opinion to require to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s 2 (of the Act).”


	
	I am aware of course of the fact, that was summarised in the matters identified by Justice McColl, that matters pertaining to the credibility or reliability of witnesses were matters that ultimately if found to be factual findings may militate in favour of the reasonableness of the decision of the learned Prosecutor to institute the proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to the matter so far as the facts issue was concerned, I note the judgment of the Supreme Court in R v Tooes [2008] NSWSC 291 and the examination of what were the relevant facts to be identified. As I have cited from s 3A of the Act, the relevant facts to be considered in this matter which I will identify in summary shortly, must be also seen in the context of other facts found, bearing in mind that this is a trial by Judge alone which required the Court, pursuant to s 132, 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986, to deliver a judgment on the giving of a verdict. Thus, with regard to matters pertinent to the “facts issue” as it is described in the submissions, and ultimately the reasonableness issue, as it is described in the submissions, the conclusions I reach have to be seen in the context of the various facts that I was required to find in returning a verdict.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of “reasonableness” I note what is included in the submissions of learned counsel for the applicant, not disputed by the learned Crown Prosecutor, from the decisions of Pavy, (1997) 98 A Crim R 396, and Cardona, [2002] NSWSC 823.Another matter to consider on the issue of “reasonableness” is considering the matter, not from the perspective of tests typically used by prosecuting agencies as a discretionary test for instituting or continuing to prosecute - that is whether a reasonable jury would be likely to convict, but addressed by reference to the quality of the evidence that it has gathered, not only as to inquiries that had been made but as to inquiries that could or should have been made DJ v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] (NSWSC 1092 per Hidden J). In that regard I note the decision of R v Dunne (NSWSC unreported 17 May 1990 per Hunt J (as he then was) particularly his Honour’s observations that;
	


“The fact that a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean that it is reasonable to launch a prosecution. There may be cases where there is contrary evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence. Moreover s 3 (of the Act) calls for an objective analysis for the whole of the relevant evidence, particularly whether or not there is an inherent weakness in the prosecution case, including matters of judgment concerning credibility.”


	
	Furthermore, I note what has been said in the judgment of Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197, where the majority of the Court rejected the argument that the relevant discretion to grant a certificate (or not grant a certificate as the case may be) was that it was proper to prosecute because “it is necessary that justice be seen to be done”. I note particularly the observations of Simpson J then of the Supreme Court, now of the Court of Appeal at [19].
	


Facts found and submissions made


	
	With regard to the issues that I am required to determine, firstly so far as the relevant facts are concerned, as I have earlier said there was a great deal of fact finding in my judgment that I need not reiterate. The Crown case against the accused was that he was alleged to have killed the deceased sometime at around about 11pm on the evening of New Year’s Eve 2012. The applicant and the deceased were in a domestic relationship and lived together in an address at Peele Street, Narrabri. They had a dispute at a hotel in the main street of Narrabri where they had been drinking earlier in the evening. The applicant walked back to the residence where they lived, the deceased arriving at the residence at a later time. There was further argument between them, initially observed by a son of the deceased and another person. Those people left the premises, and ultimately the deceased and the accused were alone in the house. The Crown case was that the accused reversed his motor vehicle to leave the premises at some time later on. The Crown case was that the deceased was killed by reason of the impact required to be proven under the legislation, given on the Crown case that she was sitting on the applicant’s car as it reversed and then drove along Peele Street.
	
	
	The deceased was located face down in Peele Street, shortly after the applicant had driven away. There were no eye witnesses to the relevant events, but there was obviously observation made of the deceased and her condition by a range of witnesses which I summarised in the judgment. There was evidence of observations made, particularly things heard, in the course of an argument between the deceased and the applicant before the accused drove his motor vehicle by reversing it up the driveway of the premises where he lived.
	
	
	As was put in the submissions of the applicant the critical issue anticipated by the prosecution was establishing relevant impact arising from the driving of the motor vehicle in circumstances contemplated by s 52(5)(g) Crimes Act 1900, whilst the accused was driving in a manner dangerous to another person. All the evidence in the case upon which I determined the matter was produced by the Crown or by the defence in the course of the Crown case. The applicant did not call evidence or give evidence, although he was extensively interviewed, as I summarised in my judgment, by investigating police.
	
	
	There was no issue at the trial that the accused drove the car. There was some evidence from a witness called Brittney Herring, the daughter of a friend of the accused, which is relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt, or could be relied upon as relevant admissions by the accused. There was communication between the applicant and Ms Herring’s parents, both orally and by text message which I took into account. The Crown also relied upon, as I said earlier, what was heard by people living or visiting a property next door to the property of the deceased.
	
	
	The position of the applicant is that the assessment of the matter in my judgment should lead to the conclusion that the Crown acting reasonably could not have established the elements of the offence based upon the material available to it, both at trial and admitted pursuant to s 3A.
	
	
	With regard to my findings a number of observations were made in the judgment relevant to the facts issue in addition to collateral factual matters that I need not repeat.
	
	
	In my judgment on verdict I held:
	


“The most detailed evidence (contemporaneous to relevant events) was from Robert Kerr (in the adjoining property) a man to whom the accused referred to as having spoken to after he discovered the deceased was injured on the road. He heard her crying saying “you left me there” and also heard her saying words similar to “you’ve been cheating on me”. She continued to yell words similar to this. At one point (Mr Kerr) walked up the stairs of his house and looked across to the neighbouring garage of the deceased and could see her legs on the ground, she was sitting on the car facing the road, he could only see her ankles and could see the “bumper” of the car but “couldn’t see exactly what car it was. She was seen by a police officer (when they attended the scene) facing in a southerly direction, the direction towards which the accused drove. The first civilian to see her, saw her face down but later observations...showed her moved to be face up.”


	
	In my ultimate determination of the matter I said:
	


“I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established the deceased was sitting on the boot of the car or elsewhere on the rear of the car as the accused was reversing up the driveway. This in my view is most unlikely. None of the physical evidence including the distance the deceased was found from where the car started reversing supports this proposition reasonably. I am satisfied positively that the accused reversed in circumstances where she was neither on the car, nor behind the car, nor in any position of immediate danger. I do not accept she was hanging onto the vehicle. It is clear that the deceased was heavily intoxicated, erratic and irrational and did not want the accused to leave her premises. Before he commenced reversing the vehicle she had tried to stop him leaving in a range of ways, including threatening to let down a rear tyre which she had partially done. (page 39)


	
	I went on to conclude or observe that the prosecution had to prove relevant impact arising out of the circumstances pleaded. The circumstance pleaded or particularised by the prosecution was impact “caused by falling from the vehicle whilst the accused drove in a manner dangerous”.
	
	
	I noted in my judgment:
	


“Furthermore the prosecution had to establish beyond reasonable doubt, provided that the accused had established the relevant evidentiary burden, that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds and the existence of facts that would not make his manner of driving dangerous i.e. that it was safe for him to back up the driveway and drive down Peele Street in the manner in which he did.”


	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that the particular elements that were ‘problematic’ for the Crown are, that the vehicle was involved in an impact whereby the deceased fell from the vehicle while being conveyed in or on the vehicle and that the impact caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The primary source of any evidence in this regard it is submitted was the evidence at post mortem and the expert opinion of Dr Duflou that death was obviously caused by a blunt force trauma, but the medical evidence could not point to the way in which the objective circumstances of the impact had occurred.
	
	
	In relation to the opinion expressed by Dr Duflou, relevant to the fact finding in this application, I note my findings in my judgment that:
	


“He was unable to indicate which of the two scenarios was more likely. He did not see the shoes that would give some indication of whether the feet had struck the ground first or not. There were no dragging injuries to the feet. His views are expressed in terms of possibilities, likelihoods or not. He said he could not estimate even as a broad estimate “what speed of movement could cause the injuries”. With regard to the blood alcohol level (of the deceased) he pointed out that it would contribute because it would slow reflexes. People who are intoxicated get into compromising situations. So far as the significance of the blood pooling (seen at the site of the body) was concerned he believed that it represented where the body came to rest but could not say what distance the body had travelled along the ground to that place and it need not have been the point of impact. He could not estimate how far the body may have been airborne before impact with the road.”


	
	The Crown acknowledged as I found in my judgment that there were no eye witnesses and, even with the benefit of Dr Duflou’s evidence and the physical evidence, there were “gaps” in the evidence (see judgment p 35).
	
	
	I determined in my judgment at page 40:
	


“Both the prosecution and the defence could only point to various possibilities as to the mechanics of the cause of injury suffered by the deceased. Other than she had a heavy fall striking her skull or moving at more than normal running speed causing longitudinal injuries either from foot to head or from her head to foot including injuries to her clavicle and hands consistent with endeavouring to break a fall, nothing else is particularly clearly shown. There is no reliable evidence as to how these injuries occurred, other than that it was not caused by the accused’s car striking the deceased head on, or by direct collision with the car. One of the issues critical to the determination of the verdict is that the totality of the evidence is unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt a particular circumstance in which the deceased came in contact either with the car or the road.”


	
	The Crown in its additional material produced a number of statements. In relation to those statements, they are the statements of Brittney Herring of 1 January 2013 and 2 January 2013, a statement of Darryl Farrar of 2 January 2013, both witnesses at the trial, and a “non-redacted” statement of Dr Duflou, dated 20 March 2013. From this material the Crown relies upon the following additional matters. It points to alleged admissions by the accused, set out in Brittney Herring’s statement, in which in her statement of 2 January at para 6 she reported that the accused said:
	


“She’s swinging off the back of the car, I hit the brakes and she went up the back window. I put my foot on the accelerator and she fell off.”


	
	Darryl Farrar in his statement at para 10 reported the accused as saying:
	


“I’ve called the cops. I’ve told them that she was chasing me down the road with a knife. It shouldn’t be long and they’ll be there. She was jumping on my car, hanging off the spoiler and trying to break it. As I drove away, I’ve braked, she fell and I drove away.:


	
	Professor Duflou in the unredacted report expressed the opinion that these accounts of representations made by the accused were consistent with the injuries observed by the deceased. It is the submission of the Crown based upon this additional evidence that this material amounts to admissions by the accused to Brittney Herring, supported by Mr Farrar and the physical evidence that would establish an impact occurred, as was initially alleged by the Crown. It relied upon other evidence about which I made findings concerning alleged directions to wipe down the car and that based upon this material the Crown had reasonable bases for addressing the issue that arose at the trial as to whether the Crown had negatived reasonable mistake of fact, on the basis of the admissions of the accused and other related material. The accused was aware of the location and movement of the deceased and had in fact deliberately braked and then accelerated to remove the deceased from the vehicle. The argument of the Crown that follows upon this additional material in that context is that in these circumstances it was thus reasonable to institute the proceedings.
	
	
	The defence submissions in relation to “reasonableness” is that the Crown case whichever way one looked at it was a speculative one, particularly in the context of the physical evidence. The opinions of Dr Duflou were of themselves highly qualified and not necessarily supported so far as any specific scenario was concerned. It was submitted on behalf of the accused that the Crown ought to have been aware of the inadequacies of the expert opinion, the qualifications and the like, and that such opinions as were expressed by the doctor were not enhanced by even the claimed admissions made to witnesses, about which they gave no evidence at the trial, of dubious quality. Ultimately bearing in mind it is submitted and accepted by the Crown that the defence had not withheld any relevant evidence or failed to bring any matter to light to assist the Crown, the Crown case was ultimately bound to fail on all the material that is available to the Court.
	


Consideration


	
	Taking into account those matters that have been identified as relevant facts in the case and also other matters which I will refer to in a moment, it is to be noted that the fact finding at trial was in very real ways influenced by the way the case was conducted. In that regard to go back to something I noted earlier at p 36 of my judgment:
	


“The Crown conceded there were gaps in the evidence as to the circumstances of the driving of the accused, conceding amongst other things that the physical appearance of the car, the damage to the spoiler for example, was explained by the accused in his interview (inconsistent with the scenarios arising from the representations in the additional evidence).

It was conceded by the Crown that there was some support for (the accused’s) version of events both from the observations of civilian witnesses and the observations of police, particularly in relation to the irrational conduct of the deceased and other surrounding circumstances.

Ultimately it was submitted that the injuries were consistent with the deceased falling from the car although it was conceded that the observations of Mr Farrar of the markings on the car were consistent with the deceased having climbed onto the car in the manner as described by the accused, not necessarily falling from or off the car as the Crown submitted was the case (in order to prove the guilt of the accused).”


	
	It is apparent by reference to the submissions of the parties before me that with the exception of the consideration of the additional evidence there is no dispute on “the facts” issue. That is in respect of the facts as I found them at the trial, including those aspects of my judgment reflected in the applicant’s submissions here. The matters of course identified in the Crown’s additional evidence have been referred to earlier.
	
	
	The prosecutor’s position on this application is that the accounts of the witnesses whose statements have been tendered and particularly cited by the Crown ultimately make it reasonable to have instituted the proceedings in so far as those accounts also apart from being admissions might support the scenario posited by the forensic pathologist. This is so, allowing even for the matters that emerged from the evidence in the trial and my analysis of them particularly the physical evidence and the gaps, or lacunae, identified in my judgment.
	
	
	In respect of the additional evidence from the civilian witnesses I note that the witnesses who provided those statements gave evidence in the trial. I note that no attempt was made to request those witnesses to refresh their memories from any statements they made nor any request was made to have the witnesses examined as unreliable witnesses in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act. Be that as it may, assuming in favour of the prosecutor’s position that the “crystal ball” test to which counsel for the applicant referred and some of the authorities referred, or the “wisdom of hindsight” test, does not apply to steps that the prosecutor could have taken but did not, assuming for example that the Crown had been permitted to take either course and the witnesses were permitted to add to and/or qualify the evidence given at trial, there is still a question as to what weight, if any, one could give to the representations sought to be adduced in this application by the Crown.
	
	
	The issue of what facts can be found and thus the reasonableness of the decision to institute the proceedings, requires consideration of the reliability and credibility of those particular witnesses and their various versions, considered in the context of other findings which might be said to contradict the additional evidence in some respects, relating perhaps to evidence of an objective character rather than based upon the reliability of memory and the like.
	
	
	In that regard I note my observations at p 41 of my judgment on verdict about both the condition of the applicant and in his versions to the police in two extensive interviews in which he gave consistent accounts in my view.
	


“Various aspects of the version that he gave to police in the electronic interviews are confirmed by a range of witnesses whose reliability is not in question. He described the deceased as being intoxicated, hysterical, variously angry and irrational. All matters confirmed by a range of independent sources, including the deceased’s own sons. These accounts include reference to the movement of other cars before his own, confirmed by (Mr) Kerr.

His “admissions” as to his driving are direct and generally consistent. This is to be taken into account in considering his earlier lies and conduct attempting to distance himself from relevant events (in the evidence of Ms Herring particularly)

None of the witnesses described the accused as being aggressive towards the deceased beforehand (although one said he appeared angry at one point). In fact they confirmed that the deceased was aggressive towards the accused. Police inspecting the accused’s hands and body saw no injuries consistent with any force used by him against the deceased. The accused described the deceased at one point, starting to let down the tyre pressure in the tyre at the rear of the motor vehicle, this is confirmed by physical examination of the vehicle. The accused specifically described the deceased as saying she “fuck’n hated (him)”. This is confirmed from a number of sources. The accused described the deceased as striking the car with her hands telling him not to go, consistent or at least no inconsistent with what witnesses described as her conduct in the time leading up to the accused’s departure from the premises. Her actions may not have left any damage on the car before the accused started driving.” (p 41-42)


	
	I made findings in my judgment on the evidence at trial concerning the fact that the objective evidence of the accused’s conduct and his accounts afterwards were consistent with one another. I acknowledged that he initially sought to distance himself from the driving of the vehicle, but also uttered representations about being unsure as to what had happened to the deceased. I said in my judgment:
	


“The accused’s conduct immediately after the event was clearly designed by him to distance himself from the circumstances that he discovered after the event the deceased was seriously injured. He told lies on a number of occasions to the police initially. He also asked Brittney Herring to “cover up” for him in a range of ways, wiping down the car and asking her to tell the police someone else had driven the car and gave a possible scenario as to how the deceased was injured. But in the context of the directions set out above in respect of “consciousness of guilt” ultimately I do not regard the body of evidence as evidence that can be taken into account in establishing his guilt of the particular offence that he is charged. Clearly, he realised after the event that he must have in some way caused severe injury to the deceased having seen her lying on the ground. He initially sought to distance himself from the driving of the car, knowing this, but was unclear as to how that happened. His lack of knowledge of what had happened is not only explicit in the account he gave in the first electronic interview and subsequently, but it is consistent with some contemporaneous statements made at the scene to Brittney Herring and others. In a text message to Brittney Herring at 12.09am on 1 January (after speaking to police) he wrote “yeah, but they want to look at me car, they reckon I hit her so if they C the car they wik (sic) no I didn’t”. This is consistent with the accused not knowing how the deceased was injured. Likewise his suggestions to Brittney in three text messages between 11.28pm and 12.25am that “Kim chased” the vehicle. In any event, within a short period of time afterwards, so far as driving the car was concerned, he had admitted (to police) he was the driver. In my view he fully cooperated with the police at the critical time of the investigation and was entirely straight forward, materially supported in a number of respects by independent or objective evidence.”


	
	In considering the additional evidence I note the findings I have made regarding Brittney Herring’s evidence in other respects, having regard to evidence in the case that contradicted her. I particularly refer to p 43 of my judgment.
	
	
	Dr Duflou expressed at some point an opinion that coincides with alleged representations made by the accused to Ms Herring and to Mr Farrar. That does not make the representations claimed to have been made by the accused necessarily true or enhance the credibility of those who gave evidence of them. I note in this regard ultimately the heavily qualified opinions of Dr Duflou. The physical evidence does not accord with the truth of the representations claimed to have been made by the accused by the two witnesses. I note also the comments I have made concerning matters arising from the conclusions that Dr Duflou made in the context of the physical evidence. As it is, the further material provided to me does not change the character of the physical evidence and other independent evidence which reflected upon the inadequacies of the Crown case or otherwise the truth of the accounts the accused had given to police.
	
	
	I note in relation to Ms Herring and Mr Farrar that as it transpired they were not particularly impressive witnesses as their presentation at trial and their versions at the trial demonstrate. It is quite clear as I said earlier that they did not come up to proof as the Crown expected. But neither did the Crown seek in any way to adduce the further evidence. To my mind these are matters that militate very strongly against their credibility. Failing to come up to proof, contradicting the versions they gave at trial in earlier statements, may be seen as relevant to the assessment of their credibility which I have already commented upon.
	
	
	The matter is not as simple as solely considering the issue from the viewpoint of the credibility of those witnesses. The prosecution is required in its assessment of the matter and accordance with the authorities to make a judgment as to the weight and/or reliability of representations claimed to have been made for example by an accused person to a witness, which are not otherwise independently proven. In the context of other evidence available, including as I pointed out the evidence that emerged at trial, the prosecution is required in that judgment to consider the extent to which the evidence at trial contradicted the contents of statements made by witnesses beforehand setting out representations allegedly made by the accused to them. It is to be borne in mind that one of the matters the Crown is required to consider is the accused’s accounts in the police interviews, his demeanour during those interviews, his cooperation with the police and other matters, all of which are independently proven amongst other ways by the video or sound recorded evidence of the interviews that took place. It is to be noted that he was found by the police to be unaffected by alcohol. Furthermore, the Crown is required to have regard to the necessary warnings or directions that a court would be required if asked to give in relation to evidence such as the representations in the additional evidence, if requested pursuant to s 165 Evidence Act 1995, as well as any other directions that are otherwise to be given.
	


Conclusion


	
	Thus, by reference to the additional evidence and the context of the facts as identified by the applicant and other facts I have cited or to be found in the judgment I have ultimately concluded both by reference to the “facts” issue and the “reasonableness” issue as they are to be separately considered, although obviously interconnected, that it is appropriate that a certificate should issue. Amongst the authorities by the way that I was taken to by learned counsel for the applicant was the decision of Kamali v R [2013] NSWSC 799, the judgment of Justice R A Hume. In that matter, at [33]-[35], he considered principles previous applied in other cases including decisions he had made himself concerning situations where the evidence was incapable of establishing an element of the offence. He noted decisions such as Williams, 1970 the judgment of President Sugarman, cited I hasten to say in Allerton and also of course the judgment of Justice McColl in Mordaunt. He noted the observations of Justice Basten in Chalal [2008] NSWCA 152, that the failure to establish any factual basis for a particular element of a prosecution case will tend to support a costs application. This is opposed, he noted, to the situation where the evidence for a particular element is merely unsatisfactory. This was a view endorsed by Justice Fullerton in the decision of Cittidini v R [2010] NSWCCA 291. He said in this particular matter it is submitted, and I accept that ultimately, even in the context of the additional evidence noting all that has been said about it, it could be argued that the Crown still have failed to satisfactorily establish the relevant element or elements of the prosecution case which is a matter that may militate in favour of the granting of the certificate.
	
	
	Thus, with that consideration of the matter, in the context of what I have said were the submissions of the parties, and their agreement as to the principles to be applied, I have concluded by reference to s 3 of the Act that, firstly, the Court should grant a certificate on the basis that had the prosecution been, before the proceedings have been instituted, in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings and there was no act or omission of the defendant that is the applicant that contributed to, or might have contributed to, the institution or continuation of the proceedings. In any event any such steps taken by the applicant were reasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Madam Crown, Mr Newby, I will give you both a copy of the certificate. I will sign that certificate now I will give you a sealed copy Madam Crown and I will give you a sealed copy Mr Newby. I will place a copy on the file. There was just one minor typographical error on the certificate in draft form.
	
	
	As I said when the judgment comes back to me from the reporting services and I will make a request for it I will include within the judgment those segments of the authorities and the legislation that I have not specifically read onto the record.
	
	
	NEWBY: Thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right there is two sealed copies for you Madam Crown and you Mr Newby for your principal and there’s a copy for the file. Thank you.

2702691,NSW Police v Pipe [2015] NSWLC 20,"Judgment


	
	On 9 and 10 March 2015, Tony Pipe was arrested by Police for High Range PCA offences. On the second occasion he was also driving whilst suspended, having been suspended the day before.
	
	
	His reading at 18:55 on 9 March was 0.387. At 16:33 on 10 March he recorded a blood alcohol concentration of 0.361.
	


Facts


	
	On both occasions his manner of driving brought him under notice.
	
	
	The first offence occurred around 17:15 on 9 March. An off duty police officer noticed a vehicle stationery in the middle of an intersection at Winmalee for some time. It appeared the driver was having difficulty in starting his red utility. Traffic was banking up so the police officer walked over to assist the driver with what appeared to be a mechanical problem.
	
	
	Immediately the officer smelt intoxicating liquor. He saw the driver continue to attempt to start the vehicle by turning the key, but his movements lacked co-ordination and his speech was incoherent. Finally the driver started the vehicle but stalled it as the ute moved forward. The police officer jumped out of the way, then reached into the vehicle and removed the keys from the ignition.
	
	
	Mr Pipe was told to get out of the vehicle but either refused to do so or was unable to do so. He was then physically removed through the passenger door where he fell onto the ground as a result of his intoxication. He was handcuffed and assisted to the side of the road as he was unable to stand up or walk.
	
	
	The intersection where the incident took place has both high pedestrian and vehicle traffic, located in close proximity to shops and a school. Traffic was heavy at the time.
	
	
	At Springwood Police Station Mr Pipe underwent a breath analysis returning a reading of 0.387. He was described by Police as seriously affected by alcohol. He told Police he had been drinking wine and had consumed “lots”. He was charged, his licence was taken from him and he received a Notice of Suspension.
	
	
	I agree with the Police that his conduct showed a total disregard to the community and represented significant danger to the public.
	
	
	The following afternoon Police were called to the car park of Winmalee shopping centre. Mr Pipe had decided to drive to the shops to purchase more alcohol.
	
	
	Whilst attempting to park outside Liquorland, Mr Pipe was observed by another driver to move in and out of a parking space a number of times. On the first attempt his driver’s side mirror collided with the passenger side of a pink Mitsubishi Mirage, parked to his right. He reversed out of the space. His second attempt saw the passenger side of his vehicle collide with a timber post in a garden bed. He turned the vehicle off, exited briefly, and then started the car and reversed out to try again. This time he collided with a van parked behind him. The driver of the van approached Mr Pipe who then got out of his ute. The red ute, now driverless, then rolled forward colliding with the garden bed.
	
	
	The driver of the van managed to remove the keys from the ute and refused to return them to Mr Pipe. The Police, who had been called, arrived shortly afterwards. Police observations of Mr Pipe were that he had glazed eyes and his speech was incoherent. He was arrested. At Springwood he returned a reading of 0.361. He told Police he had been drinking wine at home since 10:30. When asked why he was driving he responded “I know I shouldn’t have, I’m an idiot.”
	
	
	This incident occurred within a busy shopping centre car park which is also in a school zone. At the time children were leaving school, traffic and pedestrian activity was high. The risk and danger to anyone in the area was extreme. As had been the case less than twenty four hours earlier, Mr Pipe was totally incapable of driving a motor vehicle.
	


Subjective factors


	
	Mr Pipe is 48 years of age. He has nothing on his criminal record. He was first licenced in May 1984. He has one entry in 2008 for camera detected speeding for which he received a caution and one entry for disobeying traffic lights (camera detected) in 2011. I am satisfied that he was previously a person of good character and that he has an excellent driving history.
	
	
	The Court has the benefit of a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) as well as a report from Dr Glen Smith, a Consultant Psychiatrist.
	
	
	Mr Pipe is currently in a de facto relationship. He and his partner have a five year old son. He had a prior relationship of some length which ended acrimoniously in 2009. His three children of that relationship live with their mother but he sees them regularly. It appears he has been abusing alcohol for at least four years, but probably since the breakdown of his marriage in 2009 he has been drinking to excess.
	
	
	Until April 2014 he had been in regular full-time employment. He left work to address both his alcohol misuse and personal problems. Although he is now seeking work, he remains unemployed. Throughout 2014 his problems with alcohol increased and he began a cycle of binge drinking that eventually resulted in the subject offences. After the second offence he entered into residential rehabilitation at Northside West Clinic from 25 March until 13 April 2015. He continues attendance as an outpatient weekly and according to the PSR is progressing well. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) twice a week. He continues to see Dr Smith each fortnight.
	
	
	Dr Smith began treating Mr Pipe at the Northside West Clinic. He saw him eight times as an inpatient and continues to monitor his rehabilitation both at the Clinic and in his rooms.
	
	
	His description of Mr Pipe’s drinking and the effect of alcohol on him is that of a classic alcoholic. The breakdown of his prior relationship and work stresses saw Mr Pipe increase his alcohol consumption over a period of time until he was drinking between two and three bottles of wine a day. He developed a marked tolerance requiring more alcohol to achieve the effect he was seeking. Withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, tremors, agitation and cravings when not consuming alcohol, caused him to commence drinking early in the morning in order to ease the symptoms. Attempts at abstinence over the past two years failed. He spent five days in Katoomba Hospital in December 2014 but upon release immediately lapsed into alcohol abuse. He told Dr Smith he frequently had blackouts where he could not remember events due to alcohol consumption. Dr Smith diagnosed Mr Pipe with a moderate, recurrent, major depressive disorder and severe alcohol use disorder.
	
	
	Perhaps not surprisingly, Mr Pipe does not have a good recollection of his offending behaviour. A memory blackout would normally occur when a person returns readings as high as those recorded by Mr Pipe. The Police descriptions of him at the time of both arrests detail someone so intoxicated as to be unable to communicate clearly and in one case unable to stand or walk unassisted. He accepts his guilt and appears to be genuinely remorseful. It is fair to say that his rehabilitation is going very well and his prognosis is good.
	


The Guideline Judgment


	
	All NSW Courts are bound by the guideline judgment on High Range PCA offences, Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No. 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303. The guideline is set out in paragraph 146:
	


In my view the following guideline should be made:

(1) An ordinary case of the offence of high range PCA is one where:

(i)    the offender drove to avoid personal inconvenience or because the offender did not believe that he or she was sufficiently affected by alcohol;

(ii)   the offender was detected by a random breath test;

(iii)    the offender has prior good character;

(iv)    the offender has nil, or a minor, traffic record;

(v)    the offender’s licence was suspended on detection;

(vi)    the offender pleaded guilty;

(vii)   there is little or no risk of re-offending;

(viii)   the offender would be significantly inconvenienced by loss of licence.

(2) In an ordinary case of an offence of high range PCA:

(i)    an order under s 10 of the Sentencing Act will rarely be appropriate;

(ii)    a conviction cannot be avoided only because the offender has attended, or will attend, a driver’s education or awareness course;

(iii)    the automatic disqualification period will be appropriate unless there is a good reason to reduce the period of disqualification:

(iv)    a good reason under (iii) may include:

   (a) the nature of the offender’s employment;

   (b) the absence of any viable alternative transport;

   (c) sickness or infirmity of the offender or another person.

(3) In an ordinary case of a second or subsequent high range PCA offence:

(i)   an order under s 9 of the Sentencing Act will rarely be appropriate;

(ii)    an order under s 10 of the Sentencing Act would very rarely be appropriate;

(iii)    where the prior offence was a high range PCA, any sentence of less severity than a community service order would generally be inappropriate.

(4) The moral culpability of a high range PCA offender is increased by:

(i)    the degree of intoxication above 0.15;

(ii)   erratic or aggressive driving;

(iii)    a collision between the vehicle and any other object;

(iv)    competitive driving or showing off;

(v)    the length of the journey at which others are exposed to risk;

(vi)    the number of persons actually put at risk by the driving.

(5) In a case where the moral culpability of a high range PCA offender is increased:

(i)    an order under s 9 or s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would very rarely be appropriate;

(ii)   where a number of factors of aggravation are present to a significant degree, a sentence of any less severity than imprisonment of some kind, including a suspended sentence, would generally be inappropriate.

(6) In a case where the moral culpability of the offender of a second or subsequent high range PCA offence is increased:

(i)    a sentence of any less severity than imprisonment of some kind would generally be inappropriate;

(ii)    where any number of aggravating factors are present to a significant degree or where the prior offence is a high range PCA offence, a sentence of less severity than full-time imprisonment would generally be inappropriate.


	
	Mr Pipe was prior to these offences a person of good character. The guideline judgment deals with the issue of general deterrence and prior good character in these types of cases. The Court said:
	


118 This Court has frequently observed that the fact that the driver convicted of an offence under s 52A is of otherwise good character is of less relevance than it might be in sentencing for other types of offences: R v McIntyre (1988) 38 A Crim R 135 at 139. This is because of the prevalence of the commission of the offence by persons of good character and the importance of general deterrence: R v Musumeci (NSWCCA, 30 October 1997, unreported).

119 This observation applies equally, in my view, to sentencing for PCA offences in general and high range PCA offences in particular. This is because it can be inferred that, just as persons of otherwise good character commit the offence of dangerous driving by having the prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood, so they commit such an offence when it does not result in death or serious injury. Of 5,700 persons convicted of the offence in the five years to 2001, 77 per cent had no prior conviction for a PCA offence: Saffron and Chilvers, at 2.


	
	Howie J also made the following observations about the seriousness of a second offence and the fact that these are conduct offences:
	


100 As I have already indicated, the aggravated form of the high range PCA offence, that is a second or subsequent offence, carries the highest maximum sentence for any offence under the road traffic legislation and is at the top of the jurisdiction of a magistrate to sentence for any one offence. The maximum penalty prescribed is indicative of the way in which Parliament regards the offence and thus it represents the public's view of the seriousness of the crime: H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53. The maximum penalty is fundamental to a determination of the seriousness of the type of offence before the court and hence to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender: Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174. It should be noted that Parliament considers that the offence is as serious as an offence of negligent driving causing death.

101 Of course PCA offences are conduct offences: there is no element of the offence that is dependent upon the establishment of the consequences of the impugned conduct. The offence is committed even if the vehicle is not actually put into motion. It is an offence of strict liability. But, if this fact has any relevance in the determination of how an offence should be dealt with by the courts, and I do not believe that it has, it can have no weight in the case of high range PCA. It is a matter of common knowledge that at the level of intoxication represented by a reading of 0.15 the person must have consumed a quantity of alcohol that would not only manifestly influence his or her driving skills but have led the person to appreciate that fact or, at least the risk of it.

Submissions on sentence


	
	Mr Blunt, on behalf of the offender, conceded that imprisonment of some type was an appropriate penalty. His ultimate submission was that Mr Pipe should be dealt with by way of an Intensive Correction Order (ICO). He submitted that Mr Pipe was contrite, had undergone initial and apparently positive rehabilitation, was a person of prior good character, had an excellent driving history, was already assessed as suitable for a Community Service Order and was assessed as a low to moderate risk of re-offending. Mr Blunt further submitted that an ICO is a substantial punishment which may also reflect a significant degree of leniency. See R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [108] and Whelan, Heath Andrew v R [2012] NSWCCA 147 at [120].
	


Consideration of an Intensive Correction Order


	
	Section 67 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the suitability of an offender for an Intensive Correction Order.
	


67 Suitability of offender for intensive correction order

(1) An intensive correction order may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied:

(a) that the offender is of or above the age of 18 years, and

(b) that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, and

(c) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and

(d) that the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the intensive correction order.

(2) In deciding whether or not to make an intensive correction order, the court is to have regard to:

(a) the contents of the assessment report on the offender (prepared under section 70), and

(b) such evidence from the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order.

(3) A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make an intensive correction order despite the contents of the assessment report.

(4) A court may make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment only if the assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community.

(5) If a court declines to make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment despite an assessment report that states that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, the court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so.

(6) A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with subsection (5).


	
	Subject to an assessment report I am satisfied that Mr Pipe is otherwise eligible to serve a sentence by way of an ICO. Although an ICO was not an available penalty when the guideline judgment was handed down there is no doubt that it is a custodial penalty (s 7, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). The purposes of an ICO were made clear by the Attorney General in the second reading speech where he said an ICO is ""designed to reduce an offender's risk of re-offending through the provision of intensive rehabilitation and supervision in the community"". Further he said: ""Essentially, an intensive correction order is a sentence of imprisonment of up to two years that is ordered to be served in the community, where offenders can be subject to a range of stringent conditions including 24 hour monitoring, regular community work and a combination of tailored educational, rehabilitative and other related activities.""
	
	
	Nevertheless no sentence can be imposed that does not meet the requirements of s 3A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act:
	


3A Purposes of sentencing

The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:

(a)    to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	Submissions on behalf of Mr Pipe emphasised that his rehabilitation may falter and that his current treatment regime would be limited by a sentence of full-time custody. In R v Pogson, McClelland CJ at CL and Johnson J dealt with the meaning of rehabilitation in the sentencing process. Their Honours said at [115]-[117]:
	


115   It will be observed that s.3A(d) provides for a purpose of sentencing being to promote the ""rehabilitation of the offender"". The word ""rehabilitation"" is not defined in the Sentencing Procedure Act.

116   The term ""rehabilitation"" is used, as well, in s.16A(2) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which requires a sentencing court to take into account certain ""matters as are relevant and known to the court"", including ""the prospect of rehabilitation of the person"" (s.16A(2)(n)). Once again, the term ""rehabilitation"" is not defined in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

117   Although not defined by statute, the term ""rehabilitation"" has a well-recognised content in the context of sentencing. Rehabilitation as an object of sentencing has not been confined to those who are regarded as being ill or predisposed to crime by environmental factors, including alcohol or drug abuse. A statement frequently cited with respect to the concept of rehabilitation is that of King CJ in Vartzokas v Zanker (1989) 51 SASR 277 at 279 where he said:

""The passage which I have quoted from the remarks of the learned sentencing magistrate discloses, in my opinion, an error of principle. It implies that rehabilitation or reform, as an object of sentencing, is confined to those who are 'in need of rehabilitation by reason of factors such as illness or being 'predisposed to such behaviour by his environment or his experiences of life', that is to say, to persons subject to some personal or social disadvantage. That involves a misconception of the meaning of rehabilitation and its place in the sentencing process.

Rehabilitation as an object of sentencing is aimed at the renunciation by the offender of his wrongdoing and his establishment or re-establishment as an honourable law-abiding citizen. It is not confined to those who fall into wrongdoing by reason of physical or mental infirmity or a disadvantaged background. It applies equally to those who, while not suffering such disadvantages, nevertheless lapse into wrongdoing. The object of the courts is to fashion sentencing measures designed to reclaim such individuals wherever such measures are consistent with the primary object of the criminal law which is the protection of the community. Very often a person who is not disadvantaged and whose character has been formed by a good upbringing, but who has lapsed into criminal behaviour, will be a good subject for rehabilitative measures precisely because he possesses the physical and mental qualities and, by reason of his upbringing, the potential moral fibre to provide a sound basis for rehabilitation. It would be a great mistake to put considerations of rehabilitation aside in fashioning a sentence for such a person.""

 


	
	Rehabilitation is however only one aspect of s 3A that a Court must take into account. It is not accorded any priority as a consideration on sentence (except in relation to juvenile offenders). It is clear from the guideline judgment that in matters of High Range PCA offences, general deterrence and denunciation are factors of great importance in the sentencing process. As Howie J said at [143]:
	


Clearly the subjective features of the offender are relevant to a determination of the penalty for any offence, and high range PCA is no exception. But general sentencing principles require that the penalty reflect the object seriousness of the offence and that too much allowance cannot be given to subjective features particularly where deterrence and denunciation are important factors in sentencing. Simply stated, there are offences that are so serious that a penalty of some form must generally be imposed regardless of the personal circumstances of the offender. In my view high range PCA is such an offence.


	
	Although rehabilitation is a major aspect in the imposition of an ICO it is not a mandatory requirement of that sentencing option. As McClelland CJ at CL and Johnson J said in R v Pogson at [105] referring to the imposition of an ICO:
	


It is apparent that there is no provision within Division 2 of Part 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (ss.5-7), relating to custodial sentences, which specifies that an assessment of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation is required for the purpose of selection of the sentencing option.

Consideration of a suspended sentence (s 12 bond)


	
	Although there was no specific submission for Mr Pipe to be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence, I am still required to consider all options for the way in which a custodial sentence is to be served. At [144] of the guideline judgment Howie J observed:
	


Sentencing generally is concerned with punishment for the offence committed although the safety of the community may indicate that some element of protection from future conduct is appropriate. Concerns at future offending normally indicate that an element of specific deterrence is required or some step needs to be taken by way of punishment, proportional to the criminality of the offence committed, to prevent further offending. The fact that a person is unlikely to offend in the future does not generally mitigate the criminality of the offence. This is particularly so where, as with high range PCA, the offence is not impulsive nor the result of a momentary aberration. If the court were satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, this would tend to indicate that a good behaviour bond is an inappropriate sentencing disposition because there is no need to attempt to control the offender’s future conduct.


	
	Mr Pipe has made good progress in his rehabilitation to date. However the PSR assessed him as “a low to medium risk of re-offending”. The Community Corrections Officer identified criminogenic needs as “Education/employment, Leisure/recreation, Alcohol/drug problems and Emotional/personal”. It is common knowledge that overcoming any addiction is not easy. It is often a long and tortuous path littered with potholes. Alcohol addiction is never easy to beat and as AA reminds their attendees you are always an alcoholic and only one drink away from a relapse. I do not believe that I can conclude that Mr Pipe is “unlikely” to re-offend. The submissions on his behalf were in fact that he needed continued supervision and that was why an ICO was a preferable sentencing option. As continued supervision is required a suspended good behaviour bond might be an option to consider, subject to the other requirements of s 3A and the principles in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 as set out in [26]-[28].
	


26 Having determined that there is no other penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be; R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [30]. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, see R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50] to [52]; JCE at [17]. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed, see s 6 (periodic detention order), s 7 (home detention order) and s 12. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. For example it cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention: R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405, or by home detention: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 249. Nor can the term be reduced because an otherwise appropriate alternative is unavailable: R v T (NSWCCA, 19 June 1995).

27 The fact that a term of a sentence is to be determined without regard to the fact that it is to be suspended is consistent with the approach adopted in other jurisdictions where that sentencing alternative has been available for many years, see R v Percy [1975] Tas SR 62 at 73; Stevens v Giersh (1976) 14 SASR 81 at 82; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 346 per Kirby J.

28 Once the term of the sentence has been determined the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, see for example s 77 of the Act with respect to home detention. But the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: R v Jurisic at 250B.

The sentence


	
	It is clear that both of the drink driving offences have high degrees of moral culpability as set out in the guideline judgment. The degree of intoxication in both instances is extreme. On both occasions the driving took place in areas of high volume traffic at peak times. The off duty police officer was lucky to escape injury when Mr Pipe managed to restart his vehicle on 9 March. On 10 March there was a collision between Mr Pipe’s ute and two other vehicles, a fence post and a garden. On each occasion there was actual and potential danger to a large number of people.
	
	
	Despite the need for ongoing supervision of the offender’s rehabilitation, I do not consider that a suspended sentence bond could be appropriate for offences as serious as the two High Range PCA offences. On these facts such a sentence could never adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour.
	
	
	I am also of the view that in particular s 3A (b), (f) and (g), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act make an ICO or Home Detention inappropriate options, in that neither option would fulfill the “manifold purposes of punishment”. I, and no doubt many in the community, would view such options as unduly lenient. Both offences fall at the higher end of the scale of objective seriousness. Indeed it is difficult to think of any circumstances that could be more serious in respect of the second offence, without there being some injury or worse.
	
	
	The manner of driving and the extremely high moral culpability including the level of intoxication require a sentence of full-time custody.
	
	
	As pleas of guilty were entered at the first available opportunity the full discount of 25% will be applied to each sentence. Although they are separate offences one day apart, for the purpose of penalty, the “second” offence carries the same penalty as the first offence as the offender had not been convicted of the first offence prior to the commission of the second offence.
	
	
	The charge of driving whilst suspended is not in my view an offence that requires a custodial sentence. A s 9 bond with supervision can appropriately reflect the seriousness of breaching a Notice of Suspension issued by Police, particularly having regard to the offender’s prior good character and excellent driving record.
	
	
	Finally, I must turn to the issue of disqualification. Mr Pipe faces an automatic period of disqualification of twelve (12) months for driving whilst suspended. He must also be subject to Mandatory Interlock Orders for the drink driving matters. The disqualification for driving whilst suspended must be served before the interlock order can commence. In assessing the periods to apply to the Mandatory Interlock Orders, I have taken into account the fact that they will be served concurrently and that Mr Pipe previously had an excellent driving record.
	
	
	Mr Pipe, for the offence of High Range PCA on 9 March 2015 you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six (6) months to commence from today 25 September 2015. You will be eligible for release on 24 March 2016. For the offence of High Range PCA on 10 March 2015 you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of six (6) months, an additional term of six (6) months a total sentence of twelve (12) months to commence from today as well. You will be eligible for release on parole from 24 March 2016. I find special circumstances warrant a longer period on parole to aid your rehabilitation. For the offence of driving whilst suspended on 10 March 2015 you are convicted and ordered to enter into a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months and to appear before the Court for further sentence if the bond is breached. It will be a further condition of that bond that you accept supervision from Community Corrections and obey all reasonable directions for counselling and drug and alcohol rehabilitation. You must report to Community Corrections at Penrith within seven (7) days of your release from custody.
	
	
	Further, in respect of driving whilst suspended you are disqualified from driving for twelve (12) months from today 25 September 2015. For the two High Range PCA offences I make a Mandatory Interlock Order with a disqualification compliance period of nine (9) months to commence from 25 September 2016 and a participation period of three (3) years.

2702703,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 6) [2015] NSWSC 1426,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Objection has been taken on behalf of the Accused Vaziri to the Crown adducing evidence of a canvass of members of the Dawoodi Bohra community carried out by police on and after 10 September 2012.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to lead against the Accused Vaziri, evidence of a canvass undertaken by investigating police on 10 September 2012 and on some dates after, up to 25 September 2012. On those days, police distributed to members of the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney an envelope containing written material concerning female genital mutilation (“FGM”), including a letter from police, a Gujarati translation of the letter and other material, including Department of Health brochures which sought to explain the nature and effect of the offence under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 (MFI14).
	
	
	As part of the canvass, police also enquired of members of the Dawoodi Bohra community in respect of their knowledge or understanding of “khatna” or FGM in that community (MFI28, Annexure A). The responses to that question are set out in statements of police officers which are before the Court on this application (MFI26, paragraph 5; MFI37, Annexure A).
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender the answers provided in response to the questions asked about FGM as evidence against the Accused Vaziri. It is said that the recorded telephone conversations involving the Accused Vaziri disclose an intention on his part to have members of the Dawoodi Bohra community informed that they should say that they have no knowledge of FGM in the Sydney community. The Crown contends that the Accused Vaziri made statements indicative of this approach in a number of conversations recorded under telephone interception warrant ( Exhibit AA, Tabs 30, 35, 39, 41, 43, 44 and 46).
	
	
	The Crown argues that the answers given may be taken to have been given as a result of the alleged intervention by the Accused Vaziri as to what members of the Dawoodi Bohra community should say to the police. The Crown submits that this material is relevant to the charges brought against the Accused Vaziri of being an accessory after the fact to the offences alleged against the other Accused persons.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the Accused Vaziri objects to the tender of this material upon a number of bases, including its presently inadmissible form and relevance.
	
	
	The recorded conversations involving the Accused Vaziri are already in evidence before the jury. It will be open to the Crown to make submissions to the jury by reference to that evidence.
	
	
	However, there are some fundamental difficulties with the admissibility of the canvass material, certainly in its present form. What the Crown has at present is a pro forma question, and the police officer’s note of the response provided to that question by a person or persons in a particular household.
	
	
	There is no statement made by the person who is said to have provided the particular answer, nor any signed adoption. The bare form of the answer does not indicate that the Accused Vaziri played any part in the giving of a particular answer. The answers extend from ""are not aware that it happened in Australia"", ""heard of it happening but only overseas"" (or variations along those lines) to ""have to do it as part of their culture/religion"".
	
	
	In circumstances where the Crown seeks to adduce the questions and answers as evidence of facts, and as evidence supporting an inference that the Accused Vaziri was responsible for the particular answer or answers (presumably being falsely given), the evidence in its present form falls far short of satisfying the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act 1995. In effect, the Crown seeks to adduce what is presently hearsay evidence of these matters.
	
	
	I do not propose to admit the evidence of the questions and answers said to have been provided in the course of the canvass.
	
	
	This ruling is made upon the basis of the material furnished to the Court, which did not include any statement or proof of evidence of a potential Crown witness from the Dawoodi Bohra community who could give evidence on this issue. The present ruling relates only to the material which seeks to put this material before the Court in a hearsay manner for a non-hearsay purpose. I decline to admit this evidence.

2702704,Habib v R [2015] NSWCCA 261,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

In July and August 2014 the applicant was tried before Berman SC DCJ and a jury for attempting to wound his cousin, Sleiman Chidiac, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (count 1) and for recklessly wounding Nowell Chidiac (Sleiman Chidiac’s sister-in-law) (count 2) or alternatively assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Nowell Chidiac (count 3). The applicant was convicted of count 1, but acquitted of counts 2 and 3.


	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing 20 November 2014 and expiring 19 May 2016, with a balance of term of 18 months expiring 19 November 2017.
	
	
	The applicant has appealed against his conviction on the following ground:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in directing the jury that it could bear in mind the possible commission of other offences by the applicant when considering his character.

The applicant concedes that this asserted error was not raised at trial and accordingly he requires a grant of leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

Case for the Crown and defence


	
	In 2006 a dispute arose between the applicant and his cousin Sleiman Chidiac over a large tiling job at Parramatta Westfield Shopping Centre. Related civil proceedings were resolved at Parramatta District Court in 2012 in Mr Chidiac’s favour. The applicant continued to believe that Mr Chidiac owed him approximately $300,000 - $350,000.
	
	
	The applicant and Sleiman Chidiac lived near to each other in Croydon. The applicant’s home was connected to a mixed business store in Queen Street which he owned and operated. Sleiman Chidiac lived on Church Street which runs parallel to Queen Street. Sleiman Chidiac’s brother, Yusef Chidiac, also lived nearby. Sleiman Chidiac often drove past the applicant’s shop when visiting his brother.
	
	
	Tension between the applicant and Sleiman Chidiac escalated after the completion of the civil proceedings. In the two months leading up to the incident the subject of the trial, Sleiman Chidiac gave evidence that the applicant would yell profanities and threats at him every time he passed by his shop, which was approximately every second day. The threats included death threats.
	
	
	There was evidence from other persons which confirmed ill feeling between the two men.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that between 7.30pm and 8pm on Saturday, 9 March 2013 Sleiman Chidiac drove past the applicant’s shop in a black Range Rover on his way to his brother Yusef’s house. His three young children were in the back of the car. As he approached, the applicant “jumped” up, gestured with his hands and yelled out threats. Sleiman Chidiac stopped his vehicle around the corner and exited with his children. He could still hear the applicant yelling. The applicant returned to his shop and emerged with a knife in his right hand which he held behind his back. He then walked towards Sleiman Chidiac.
	
	
	Part of that version of events was confirmed by footage from various CCTV cameras. The footage was tendered at trial. It showed the applicant leaving his shop with a knife in his hand and walking in the direction of the black Range Rover.
	
	
	The sound of yelling in the street caught the attention of Yusef Chidiac, who exited his home to investigate. He saw the knife in the applicant’s hand and said “Watch out, he has a knife in his hand”.
	
	
	The applicant approached Sleiman Chidiac with his right hand behind his back. When he came within a metre of Sleiman Chidiac, he pulled the knife from behind his back, raised it with his right hand and brought the knife down in a stabbing motion. Sleiman Chidiac grabbed at the applicant’s right wrist and the knife grazed his forearm. As Sleiman Chidiac tried to disarm him, the applicant continued to make threats.
	
	
	Yusef Chidiac assisted his brother in grabbing the applicant’s right arm and trying to disarm him. He gave evidence of the applicant resisting, refusing to let go of the knife and continuing to try to stab Sleiman Chidiac. Other family members arrived and succeeded in disarming the applicant. Included in that group was Nowell Chidiac who was Yusef Chidiac’s wife. Triple 0 was called and in due course police arrived.
	
	
	At some point during that confrontation, the applicant suffered an injury to his left eye. No-one was charged in relation to that injury. Sleiman Chidiac did not see any injury to the applicant that night and did not see how the injury occurred. Nowell Chidiac thought that she saw the applicant’s face forced onto the top of the knife by the weight of persons holding him down. This occurred when he was resisting the efforts of others to disarm him. Police who attended at the scene, confirmed that when they arrived the applicant had suffered an injury to his left eye. As a result of that injury, the applicant effectively lost the sight of that eye.
	
	
	It was the applicant’s case at trial that it was Sleiman Chidiac who always shouted abuse and threats at him when he drove past his shop. On the night of 9 March 2013 he was sitting with two cousins outside his shop when Sleiman Chidiac slowly drove past and shouted insults and swore at him.
	
	
	When Sleiman Chidiac stopped his car he stood on the corner and continued to swear at the applicant and shouted for the applicant to “meet me here so I can give you the money”. Sleiman Chidiac then started to walk towards him.
	
	
	When the applicant saw Sleiman Chidiac approaching, he went inside the shop and got a knife because Sleiman Chidiac was bigger than him and he was afraid for his family. He walked towards Sleiman Chidiac with the knife in his hand. He shouted at Sleiman Chidiac to “leave me alone”. The applicant agreed that he raised the knife in his right hand to above his shoulder. His evidence was that he moved the knife forward only to scare Sleiman Chidiac, not to harm him.
	
	
	Thereafter a scuffle ensued in which Sleiman Chidiac, Yusef Chidiac and others participated which led to the applicant being disarmed. The applicant denied that he had ever tried to stab Sleiman Chidiac. He said that he held onto the knife to protect himself when he was attacked by Sleiman and Yusef Chidiac and by other family members, including Nowell Chidiac, who was kicking him in the face.
	
	
	The applicant denied that he was angry with Sleiman Chidiac over money matters, although he did accept that he had been upset over the money issue for seven years. His wife supported his evidence that Sleiman Chidiac used to shout threats and swear at him when he drove past.
	
	
	At trial evidence of good character was called on behalf of the applicant. Michael Kalil, a friend of 15 years, gave evidence that he knew the applicant as a family man and as an honest and correct person. To Mr Kalil’s knowledge he was not the sort of person who would be likely to stab anyone. In cross-examination Mr Kalil agreed that he did not know how the applicant would react when he was angry because he had never seen him angry.
	
	
	Written character testimonials by Neyif Hanna and Michael Aboud to similar effect were tendered at trial as Exhibits C and D respectively. It was common ground that the applicant had no criminal record and was not known to police.
	


The appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that it was agreed that he was a man of prior good character and that this was not disputed by the Crown. His counsel concluded his closing address by reference to his applicant’s good character.
	
	
	In summing up to the jury, the trial judge instructed them to take the applicant’s good character into account. The applicant accepted that his Honour’s direction as to good character was unexceptionable except for the final paragraph where his Honour said (emphasis added):
	


“On the other hand, Mr Habib is not an eighteen year old. He is older than that and so you might think the fact that he has not, up until now, committed any criminal offence is an important matter that you can take into account. On the other hand, of course, as Mr Russell acknowledges, there were perhaps offences that Mr Habib did in fact commit that night, threatening somebody with a knife, carrying a knife in a public place, so bear that in mind too when you consider Mr Habib’s character.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the emphasised portion of the direction, not only undermined the previous unobjectionable directions as to character, but did so in a way which positively encouraged the jury to take into account bad character. The applicant accepted that even if a good character direction were given “the judge may qualify it in order to put it in perspective having regard to the circumstances of the case” (Melbourne v R [1999] HCA 32; 198 CLR 1 at 29 [79] per Gummow J). He accepted that in the present case, his Honour was giving a modified good character direction based upon his acts which preceded the wounding of the victim. He also accepted that the trial judge was entitled to qualify the good character direction because of his acknowledged willingness to engage in criminal conduct earlier that night, albeit of a lesser significance than the conduct charged.
	
	
	Despite that concession, the applicant submitted that his Honour was in error in giving a good character direction which, put at its highest, was confusing in that it failed to explain to the jury just how it could take into account his willingness to engage in other criminal conduct earlier in the evening. The applicant submitted that what his Honour should have done was to make sure that the jury understood that engaging in such conduct earlier in the evening could not be used as evidence of bad character. He submitted that it should have been explained to the jury that if they did have regard to the earlier conduct, they could but were not obliged to, put aside the issue of character altogether.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s error was that no clear explanation was given to the jury of how they could use this evidence. He submitted that the jury should have been told that the relevance of the evidence was limited solely to a diminution of the probative force of the good character evidence, perhaps even to the point where the good character evidence was not taken into account, but they could not use the evidence adversely to him in the sense of using it as evidence of bad character. The applicant submitted that the direction contained no such qualification. He submitted that in the form in which it was given, the direction left open and almost invited the jury to take into account his further offences as impacting on the issue of guilt.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the error by the trial judge was compounded when his Honour referred to “the acknowledgment” made by his counsel of his commission of other offences. He submitted that the “acknowledgement” to which his Honour was referring was not made during that part of the closing address dealing with the issue of good character but was made at the outset of the closing address in which counsel urged the jury to focus its attention on the offences actually charged.
	


“It would be no surprise to you that if a person is carrying a knife in public and they don’t have a reasonable excuse for doing that, that is prohibited. If a person threatens a person with a knife, like I am doing now and shouts angry words at them, that may be an offence, but Mr Habib is not charged with those matters. He is charged with the offences you have before you in the indictment. That is very important to remember. So you must carefully examine these specific charges and what is required to prove each of them remembering always that the absolutely [sic] onus to that very exacting and high standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt remains with the Crown from start to finish.” (T.304.35)


	
	The applicant submitted that the difficulty with his Honour’s reference to the “acknowledgement” was that the passage was in no way linked to the issue of good character. He submitted that in those circumstances, having referred the jury to the “acknowledgement”, it was incumbent upon his Honour to make plain to them the use to which the “acknowledgment” could be put.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the direction given by his Honour suffered from the same defect as the direction held to be erroneous in R v Alkaitis [2004] EWCA Crim 1072. That direction was:
	


“Let me now turn then members of the jury to the defence case. Before I deal with [the appellant’s] evidence, let me say something to you about what lawyers call her character. You have heard that she is technically a woman of good character in the sense that she has no previous convictions, however, she herself admits that she has on numerous occasions taken illegal hard drugs which nobody would dispute is an admission of serial offending over a period of years in any country in which she has been taking such drugs. When considering her evidence, have regard to her admission and the fact that it is made in the context of her not having been convicted, and consider whether that adds to her credibility, or the likelihood of her now committing this offence. What you must not do is jump from her admission to the conclusion that she has therefore committed the offence with which she is now charged. That would be wholly unfair.”

In allowing the appeal against conviction, Penry-Davey J held (at [20]):

“It is, however, the nature of that modified direction that has troubled us. In our judgment there is force in [counsel’s] main point that the only way in which one part of the direction can sensibly be interpreted is that it tells the jury that they can take into account the appellant’s admission as to taking Class A drugs in relation to her credibility and more particularly, in relation to the likelihood of her having committed the offence with which she was charged. Although the final sentence counters that to some extent, it is only to a limited extent. The effect of the direction (albeit it was clearly not what the judge intended) was, if anything, potentially to damage the appellant rather than in any way to assist her on questions of credibility and propensity.”

Consideration


	
	The fact that this point was not taken at trial and requires the leave of the Court pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is a matter of importance. In Jubraeel v R [2015] NSWCCA 131 Macfarlan JA (with whom Johnson J and R S Hulme AJ agreed) set out the relevant principles:
	


“24   On appeal, the applicant’s counsel acknowledged that because the applicant’s trial counsel did not request that the trial judge give any further directions, the applicant required the leave of this Court under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) to advance this ground of appeal. In light of a trial counsel’s duty to object to evidence and seek redirections following the Summing-Up, leave under r 4 is not lightly given. Obtaining leave requires an applicant to satisfy the court that the failure to give the jury a particular direction (or other error) has caused a miscarriage of justice (Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [72] per McHugh J), or at least that there is a possibility that that is the case (R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163 NSWLR 138 at [55] per Howie J).

25   In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ provided the following summary of important considerations in relation to r 4:

""148    The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20] - [21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467 at [10] - [13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; 196 A Crim R 472 at [58] - [61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].""”

Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the direction was erroneous and whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred when assessing whether leave under r 4 should be granted.


	
	When considering the merits of the ground of appeal, what his Honour said needs to be considered in context. That context includes what the applicant’s counsel said and what his Honour said concerning character. In that regard, it should be noted that the Crown said nothing about the character evidence in his address to the jury.
	
	
	What counsel for the applicant said early in his address has already been set out (see [26] hereof). At the conclusion of his address, he said:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen, remember when you are determining this matter, and his Honour will give you some fuller and better directions than I could ever give you on this point, but the accused is a person of prior good character. I mentioned to you at the very outset that is important, it is important. It’s important enough that his Honour will mention it to you because, in our law, it is a very important consideration. The consideration is along these lines. If you consider him to be a person of good character that is a matter for you but take into account the character witnesses, you heard Michael give evidence yesterday. The two statements, short as they are, saying what they know about Mr Habib – if you find he is a person of good character and I suggest there is no reason why you would not, the Crown is not suggesting he is not a person of prior good character, then the law says this in essence that you can take that into account as to whether he would be likely to commit this offence as suggested by the Crown, or these offences as suggested by the Crown. Secondly, when he denies the allegations, denying striking or having an intention to strike anyone that denial is more creditworthy if he is a person of prior good character. You must remember that prior good character cannot operate as some cloak or blanket protection for everybody because, if you think about it, if people came to court and said “I’m a person of prior good character” – “Not guilty” – it is not a blanket protection, it just means that these are things you need to take into account.” (T.326.17)


	
	The full context of what his Honour said concerning character is as follows:
	


“Let me move on to an issue that Mr Russell finished on. It concerns his client’s character. You heard evidence that Mr Habib has no criminal convictions, whether for offences of violence or any offence at all. And not only that of course there was evidence called in the form of a witness and also two documents were tendered, and that evidence concerned Mr Habib’s character as well, his honesty, him being a family man, his reputation, the fact that he was not a violent man.

Now you heard that evidence and you heard it because you are entitled to take it into account. You can take it into account two ways. The first is that a person who has not done this sort of thing in the past, and who has the character that a witness spoke about is, you might think, less likely to have committed the offences that he is charged with than a person who has a history of criminal behaviour, especially a person who has got a history of violent criminal behaviour.

So a person who has never been convicted of any offence, and especially an offence of violence, and who has the character and reputation that the witnesses have spoken about you might think is less likely to have committed this offence than a person who does not have the history that Mr Habib does and who does not enjoy the reputation that the accused does. So that is just a matter of common-sense members of the jury. You can take the evidence into account in determining the likelihood that Mr Habib would have done what the Crown alleges.

The second way you can take it into account is this. Mr Habib has given evidence and the fact that he has no criminal convictions, the fact that people speak about his honesty might, you think, be relevant to whether you accept what Mr Habib said. You might think that in other words people of good character who have never been convicted of a criminal offence are perhaps less likely to lie in court than people of bad character who do have criminal convictions. So you can take the accused’s character into account in that way as well in deciding whether the prosecution has proved that he is guilty.

Now of course, as Mr Russell himself acknowledged, good character is just one of the many things that you take into account in deciding whether the guilt of the accused has been proved. Mr Russell made this point, and so will I. At every stage a person, even a person with a lengthy series of criminal convictions, at some stage that person has had no criminal convictions. So at some stage they have been able to say “I am a person with no criminal convictions”, and the obvious point is that people do have to start somewhere.

On the other hand Mr Habib is not an 18 year old. He is older than that and so you might think the fact that he has not, up until now, committed any criminal offence, is an important matter that you can take into account. On the other hand of course, as Mr Russell acknowledges, there were perhaps offences that Mr Habib did in fact commit that night, threatening someone with a knife, carrying the knife in a public place, so bear that in mind too when you consider Mr Habib’s character.” (SU 13.9 – 15.6)


	
	In circumstances where the Crown was not disputing that the applicant was of good character, a direction of the kind sought by the applicant would in the context of what his Honour said, have been unfavourable to him. It would of necessity have drawn the jury’s attention to the issue of bad character (a subject which had received no mention anywhere in the trial). Having raised that issue, it would have been necessary for his Honour to point out that the possible effect of the applicant having committed other offences earlier in the evening might produce a result whereby good character should be entirely ignored so that the applicant would have received no benefit.
	
	
	Looked at in context, what his Honour said was very different to the direction impugned in R v Alkaitis. His Honour’s direction made no mention of “bad character” and most particularly, did not raise the possibility of “bad character” being relevant to the likelihood of the applicant committing these offences. The total effect of his Honour’s direction was positive, so far as the applicant was concerned. It ended with an appropriate qualification that in assessing good character, the jury also had to take into account the acknowledged offending which might also have occurred that night.
	
	
	The content of his Honour’s character direction is consistent with that which was approved by the House of Lords in Regina v Aziz [1996] AC 41. That was a case where the trial judge had given what the court described as a “credibility” good character direction in respect of two accused and a “propensity” good character direction in respect of another. There was evidence that the two offenders, who had received only the “credibility” direction had committed other illegal (dishonest) conduct for which they had not been convicted. The Court of Appeal held that all three should have received both credibility and propensity good character directions, quashed the convictions and granted retrials.
	
	
	In dismissing the Crown appeal, Lord Steyn (with whom the other four Law Lords agreed) said at 52:
	


“(d) What is good character?

The certified question, although phrased in very general terms, was intended to raised the problem whether a defendant without any previous convictions may “lose” his good character by reason of other criminal behaviour. It is a question which was not directly before the Court of Appeal in Vye [1993] 1 W.L.R 471. It is a complex problem. It is also an area in which generalisations are hazardous. Acknowledging that a wide spectrum of cases must be kept in mind, the problem can be illustrated with a commonplace example. A middle-aged man is charged with theft from his employers. He has no previous convictions. But during the trial it emerges, through cross-examination on behalf of a co-defendant, that the defendant has made dishonest claims on insurance companies over a number of years. What directions about good character, if any, must the judge give?...

That brings me to the nature of the discretion. Discretions range from the open-textured discretionary powers to narrowly circumscribed discretionary powers. The residual discretion of a trial judge to dispense with character directions in respect of a defendant of good character is of the more limited variety. Prima facie the directions must be given. And the judge will often be able to place a fair and balanced picture before the jury by giving directions in accordance with Vye [1993] 1 W.L.R. 471 and then adding words of qualification concerning other proved or possible criminal conduct of the defendant which emerged during the trial…”


	
	It follows that I am not satisfied that there was error in his Honour’s direction as to good character. Even if his Honour did err and it is found that he should have given a more comprehensive direction which took into account the possibility of a finding of bad character, there is no indication that the jury took his direction into account in that way. There was simply no mention of bad character anywhere in either the addresses of counsel or the summing up. The summing up on character was positive in its terms and favoured the applicant. The ultimate qualification did no more than make it clear to the jury that the positive value which they could give to the applicant’s good character might need to be tempered by regard to his acknowledged earlier offending.
	
	
	Such a conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the applicant was acquitted of counts 2 and 3, that there was no suggestion by the Crown that the applicant was not a person of good character and that counsel for the applicant did not consider it necessary to seek a redirection as to good character. Accordingly, even if there were an error in the direction, I am not satisfied that any miscarriage of justice occurred. It could certainly not be said that the applicant lost a chance of acquittal which was fairly open. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	In view of the fact that the ground of appeal is based on a bare possibility and that there is no indication anywhere in the evidence, addresses, or summing up of that possibility eventuating, leave to appeal under rule 4 should not be granted.
	
	
	Pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules I would refuse leave for the applicant to rely upon this ground of appeal.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2702708,Ellis v R [2015] NSWCCA 262,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant, Blake Geoffrey Ellis, plead guilty to the offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) in the District Court. The applicant was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, backdated to the date of his arrest.

Early in the sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge was alerted to the reluctance by the applicant to identify his co-offenders. Shortly after the commencement of the applicant’s evidence in chief, the sentencing judge asked the applicant to identify a person in a photograph that had been tendered by the Crown. After the applicant stated that he was not prepared to identify the persons in the photograph, as he did not want to place his family or himself in danger, the sentencing judge intervened by making comments such as, “you will not tell me in this court who you’ll give evidence about and what you’ll give evidence about” and “if you’re going to get in the witness box to give evidence about your role in this matter you’re going to tell me the whole truth and you’re going to tell me the whole story and not be selective about it because otherwise what’s the value of your evidence with respect?”. The sentencing judge subsequently questioned and criticised the applicant’s solicitor regarding the refusal of the applicant to identify persons in the photograph. This culminated in the applicant discontinuing his evidence and withdrawing that which he had given thus far.

The applicant’s solicitor tendered a police report concerning damage suspiciously caused to the applicant’s mother’s car and a threatening note that had been left in her letterbox two days later saying “If B talks you’re next bitch”.

In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge made a number of comments regarding the refusal by the applicant to give evidence. He stated that the reason the applicant had fears for his safety “was not made clear” and the fact that one of the applicant’s co-offenders could give evidence in his sentence proceedings without identifying certain persons was not a matter that would assist the sentencing judge in conducting the proceedings. The sentencing judge also referred to a number of areas where, in the absence of evidence from the applicant, he could not accept submissions favourable to him, both in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective circumstances. For example, the involvement of the applicant in the commission of the offence and the applicant’s motive for committing the offence.

The applicant sought leave to appeal on two grounds. First, that he was denied procedural fairness and the sentencing proceedings miscarried by reason of the sentencing judge’s intervention during his evidence and insistence that the applicant identify the persons in the photograph. Second, that he had a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence was compared with the sentences passed upon his co-offenders. An extension of time to apply for leave to appeal was required.

As the Court found merit in the first ground of appeal, with the result that the matter was remitted to the District Court for rehearing, the Court considered that it was unnecessary to deal with the second ground.

Held (Bathurst CJ, RA Hulme and Garling JJ), extending the time for lodging an application for leave to appeal, granting leave to appeal, allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the District Court for resentencing:

As there was a miscarriage of justice, an extension of time to grant leave to appeal should be granted. [5]

Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601

It is not the function of a judge to perform an inquisitorial role, as distinct from adjudicating on issues raised by the parties. There are a number of risks to a fair trial which may occur as a result of excessive intrusion by a trial judge, including the inability of a judge who has descended into the arena to properly assess the demeanour of a witness and the possibility of creating the impression of pre-judgment. The ultimate question will be whether the intervention was unjustifiable and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice will occur where the conduct of the judge prevents a party from properly presenting his or her case. [57], [65]

Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15; Jones v National Coal Board (1957) 2 QB 55; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510; Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263; Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593; R v Capaldo [2015] SASCFC 56

The sentencing judge’s intervention was unwarranted, deprived the applicant of the opportunity to properly present his case and led to a miscarriage of justice. This was due to a number of reasons. First, the question about the photograph which led to the exchange was of doubtful relevance. Second, the timing of the question early on in the applicant’s examination in chief and before evidentiary issues had crystallised, particularly given that there are good reasons for drug offenders to be reluctant to identify co-offenders. Third, the reaction of the sentencing judge after the applicant had denied answering the question, namely, the suggestion that the applicant was not prepared to tell the truth. Fourth, in making the comment that the applicant must tell the whole truth otherwise “what’s the value to your evidence”, the sentencing judge misapprehended his role. Fifth, the judge should have considered the police report and threatening note relevant to the applicant’s reluctance to identify his co-offenders. Sixth, the refusal to entertain any submission regarding the circumstances in which the applicant’s co-offender was not required to give similar evidence in his sentence proceedings. [66]-[72], [74]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Blake Geoffrey Ellis (the applicant) applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by a judge of the District Court (the sentencing judge) on 3 July 2012 for one count of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 5000 penalty units. There is also a standard non parole period of 15 years: s 33(3)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act; Div 1A of Pt 4 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, which was backdated to the date of the applicant’s arrest (10 May 2011). The sentence was said to reflect a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian benefit flowing from the applicant's early plea of guilty.
	
	
	The applicant sought leave to appeal on two grounds:
	


1.   “The applicant was denied procedural fairness and the sentence proceedings miscarried by reason of the learned sentencing judge's intervention during the applicant’s evidence and his Honour's insistence that the applicant identify the persons depicted in exhibit E”.

2.   “The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentences passed upon his co-offenders”.


	
	An extension of time to apply for leave to appeal was required. The Crown accepted that if the Court came to the view that there was a miscarriage of justice, an extension of time to grant leave to appeal should be granted. This undoubtedly was correct: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [30].
	
	
	We have found merit in the first ground of appeal, with the result that the matter is to be remitted to the District Court pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for rehearing. In those circumstances, an extension of time should be granted. Moreover, having regard to the applicant’s success on the first ground, it is unnecessary to determine the second ground.
	


Facts


	
	The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty alleged that 19.275 kilograms of MDA (the prescribed “large commercial quantity” is 500 grams) was manufactured at a property at Werris Creek (the Werris Creek property) between 24 November and 15 December 2010.
	
	
	A 15 page ""statement of facts"" was tendered by the Crown in the sentence proceedings. There was no dispute about its contents, but a single paragraph at the end of the document identified three issues which remained in dispute.
	
	
	The judge expressed concern during the sentence hearing and referred to this again in his reserved judgment, that the source of the information contained in the statement of facts was not apparent on its face. Why this was a concern in relation to facts which were not disputed is not apparent.
	
	
	Where there is no dispute, it is preferable that a “statement of facts” actually states the facts rather than summarises the evidence, with it being left up to the judge to work out what the evidence establishes. Regrettably, the statement of facts in this case was a very poorly prepared document, comprising, in large part, a summary of evidence, not all in chronological order. It included a substantial amount of pedantic detail of no relevance. It was a document that may have tested the patience of any judge presiding in a busy court. However, based upon that document, the following facts may be discerned, at least as sufficient for present purposes.
	
	
	There was a joint criminal enterprise involving the applicant and more than six other participants to manufacture MDA at the Werris Creek property between the dates mentioned above.
	
	
	MDA is found in tablets that are sold as “Ecstasy”. That drug is supposed to contain 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA), but is sometimes found to contain other components, including MDA.
	
	
	The applicant and three of the participants in the enterprise had lived in the same area of Sydney and had known each other for years.
	
	
	A number of the participants were involved in the acquisition of chemicals and laboratory equipment on about 21 or 22 November 2010 and on prior occasions. The acquisitions were financed by one of the applicant’s co-offenders, a Mr Yazdani.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant, on 1 November 2010, he and another participant attended a large hardware store in Caringbah and purchased a substantial quantity of items for use in the manufacturing process. On 4 November 2010, he paid for and collected further items on special order from the same store.
	
	
	On or about 2 November 2010, the applicant and another participant ordered a large quantity of hosing from an auto parts store, which was collected and paid for two days later.
	
	
	The offenders involved in the acquisition of the materials on 21-22 November drove to a location in Yowie Bay where glassware items were transferred to a vehicle of which the applicant was an occupant. Various chemicals and equipment were stored at a property in the Nowra area in the ensuing day or so.
	
	
	On 24 November 2010, one of the participants in the enterprise travelled to Werris Creek where he met with the owner of the Werris Creek property in the area and arranged for the use of a shed on the property in exchange for a promised payment of $50,000. Three vans arrived shortly after and were directed to the Werris Creek property by the owner of the property. The applicant was a passenger in one of the vans and, when they arrived at the property, he assisted with the unloading of chemicals and laboratory equipment.
	
	
	Some of the occupants of the vans then left, while others remained, including the applicant. The statement of facts included that “it was during the next three weeks that the men manufactured a large commercial quantity of … MDA”, but it was later noted that the applicant's involvement in the process was a matter of dispute.
	
	
	A photographic identification procedure with the owner of the property revealed that the applicant (and others) had been at the Werris Creek property from 24 November to 15 December 2010, but it was not asserted that the applicant had been there every day in this period. It was accepted by the Crown that he had, at least, been away in Sydney on 3-4 December.
	
	
	On the morning of 15 December 2010, the offender and other participants packed up chemicals, equipment and the finished drug and left the property. The offender had travelled from Sydney very early that morning in his father's van and arrived back in Sydney that evening. The owner of the property found that a small amount of equipment had been left behind.
	
	
	In the afternoon of 15 December, a van containing two of the applicant's co-participants in the enterprise was pulled over by a police officer at Quirindi for a random breath test. The officer’s suspicions were aroused and he searched the van. He found laboratory equipment and arrested the men for possession of implements used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. Specialist police attended the following day and an examination of the items seized detected chemicals relevant to the manufacture of MDA and MDMA. A further examination of the van uncovered 16 vacuum sealed plastic bags of powder which, upon later analysis, was found to be 19.275 kg of MDA.
	
	
	Subsequent examination and analysis established that various items recovered from the van had been used in the manufacture of MDA. The applicant's fingerprints were on some of them.
	
	
	The applicant and another participant in the enterprise, Mr Freeman, were travelling back to Sydney at the time of the arrests at Quirindi. They met with Mr Yazdani and another participant at a hotel in Darling Harbour. They asked Mr Yazdani for money to enable them to leave the country immediately.
	
	
	The following day (16 December), the applicant, Mr Freeman and others met with Mr Yazdani at the latter's apartment at Elizabeth Bay. The NSW Crime Commission had the premises under surveillance. The applicant and Mr Freeman were given money by Mr Yazdani and they immediately went to the airport and, paying cash for tickets, boarded a flight to Hong Kong. They subsequently travelled to Bangkok.
	
	
	Various items were seized from Mr Yazdani's apartment a few days later, including a reaction flask, upon which was found material containing a DNA profile consistent with being the applicant’s.
	
	
	Police did not locate the site of the manufacturing process at Werris Creek until March 2011. A search uncovered items associated with the manufacture of MDA, as well as detecting fingerprints and DNA profiles of various participants. The applicant’s fingerprints or DNA profile were found on a toaster, cigarette butts (including in a room where the manufacturing was carried out) and a remote control device.
	
	
	The applicant returned to Australia on 18 January 2011. He was arrested on 10 May 2011.
	
	
	After summarising the evidence from which the foregoing has been derived, the statement of facts concluded with a summary dealing with the following matters:
	


●   The offender was part of a joint enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug.

●   The earliest involvement of the offender was on 1 November 2010, with the purchase of items from a large hardware store.

●   The manufacture was of an amount of MDA of just over 19 kilograms.

●   At least seven other persons (potentially more) were involved in the joint enterprise.

●   The manufacturing process took place between 23 November and 15 December 2010 at the Werris Creek property.

●   Prior to the manufacture itself, the offender was involved, as referred to above, in receiving the glassware and obtaining material to be used in the manufacture.

●   The offender travelled with others to the Werris Creek property on 24 November 2010. He remained at the property for some time after 24 November. He travelled to Sydney between 3 and 4 December 2010.

●   The offender left the Werris Creek property on 15 December 2010 after being involved with packing up the following: a) the large commercial quantity of MDA; b) glassware; c) the remaining chemicals and other equipment.

●   The offender left Australia on 16 December 2010 and returned on 18 January 2011.


	
	The statement of facts concluded by setting out the matters that remained in dispute:
	


1.   The offender’s involvement with what was unloaded from the vans that attended the Werris Creek property on 24 November 2010.

2.   The offender’s role in the joint criminal enterprise to manufacture.

3.   The amount of time the offender was present at the Werris Creek property between 23 November and 15 December 2010.

The sentence proceedings


	
	Early in the sentence proceedings, there was a discussion between the sentencing judge and the solicitor for the applicant, Mr Goold, concerning the role that the applicant played in the manufacture of the MDA. The solicitor said that the applicant’s “role was as a transporter and a purchaser of goods” and he was not, “in the vernacular, the cook or participating in assisting in the chemical process that produced the prohibited drug”. He also said that evidence would be drawn from the applicant as to his contemplated profit from the enterprise. The following exchange then took place:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I mean the cook might only get $100,000 out of it if it’s worth $5 million.

…

GOOLD: We’re not contending we’re getting that much but that will be evidence drawn from the offender in relation to what his anticipated profit was. But certainly we are contending a minor role your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well I take it your client is going to be able to give evidence of the roles everyone had in the matter?

GOOLD: I’m not – well I anticipate he’ll be able to identify his role.

HIS HONOUR: No but he’ll be able to identify other people’s role wouldn’t he?

GOOLD: He will. He’s-

HIS HONOUR: Well I mean if you’re going to talk about the role of somebody in a particular criminal enterprise and the person’s present when other people are participating in that criminal enterprise, you’d think they’d be a position to inform a third party as to what the role of the others was, as-

GOOLD: One of the other parties has already identified his role. He’s been sentenced for that.

HIS HONOUR: No, not but there’s lots of parties identified and presumably your client is going to give evidence of his knowledge of those people and their role in the matter as he understood it.

GOOLD: Well I have an understanding of the evidence he will give. As to the identification of those persons, the main reasons will be put before your Honour as to why they will not be identified by the-

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right, well let’s talk about the people that I know about from the facts.”


	
	It can be seen from that exchange that there was at least an early indication to the sentencing judge of reluctance by the applicant to identify his co-offenders.
	
	
	The Crown called a police officer, Detective Senior Constable Gary Adams. During the course of his evidence, a photograph was tendered. The photograph was said to have been taken on 16 December 2010 at a property at Elizabeth Bay where Mr Yazdani was said to be residing. Notations on the photograph identified two of the persons shown as the applicant and Mr Yazdani. The Crown did not attempt to lead evidence from Detective Adams identifying the four other persons in the photograph.
	
	
	Detective Adams also gave evidence that Mr Yazdani was the financier of the enterprise the subject of the charges and that the applicant was a long-time associate of Mr Freeman.
	
	
	It was not challenged in the cross-examination of Detective Adams that the applicant and Mr Yazdani were two of the persons who appeared in the photograph.
	
	
	The applicant was called to give evidence. Shortly after the commencement of his evidence in chief, the following exchange occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR

Q.   Just tell us there’s the photograph you might as well tell us who the people were shown in the photograph? You might tell me who the people are in the photograph because I’m not familiar with the people and it’s very hard for me to work out?

A.   Your Honour I’m not prepared to say who anyone is.

Q.   Why are you giving evidence for if you’re not prepared to tell me the truth?

A.   Because I’m not put my family in danger for the sake of myself or for the Court to give these people up-

Q.   Have you been told-

A.   because the people involved-

Q.   Excuse me, no let me just give you a lesson in giving evidence. You get in the witness box and give evidence. If you refuse to give evidence you could be in contempt of court do you understand that?

A.   Yes.

HIS HONOUR: You can claim privilege against self-incrimination but if it’s not a privilege against self-incrimination you can’t tell me and you will not tell me in this court who you’ll give evidence about and what you’ll give evidence about. I don’t know whether it’s been explained to you if you’re going to get in the witness box to give evidence about your role in this matter you’re going to tell me the whole truth and you’re going to tell me the whole story and not be selective about it because otherwise what’s the value of your evidence with respect? I ask that rhetorically of you, your counsel and the Crown Prosecutor.

Mr Goold what’s the, did you know your client was going to get in the witness box and then just be selective about what he was going to tell me?

GOOLD: I knew he was going to have concerns about identifying people on the basis of his concerns. I can hand you a document which-”


	
	It was not disputed that the document to which Mr Goold was referring was a Police report relating to a report of malicious damage to a motor vehicle owned by the applicant’s mother, which occurred on 20 January 2012, and a report of a note in the applicant’s parents’ letterbox stating, “If B talks you’re next bitch”. At the hearing of this application, the Crown accepted that it was open to infer that Mr Goold attempted to show this document to the sentencing judge in support of the fact that the applicant had genuine concern for his family.
	
	
	The exchange continued as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I’m not worried about you handing me a document. I am concerned about the basis upon which he’s been called to give evidence.

GOOLD: He’s been called to give evidence on the basis of his role in this enterprise.

HIS HONOUR: How is he going to explain to me his role if he’s not going to tell me the whole truth, Mr Goold? You assist me in that regard.

GOOLD: He accepts-

HIS HONOUR: May I just pause for a moment, how is the Crown going to test his version of events if he doesn’t disclose relevant information? How can his version be properly tested if he does not disclose the relevant information that goes to explaining his role which would of necessity I would have thought be concerned with identifying particular people. You think about it because you’re the one who has called him.

GOOLD: I am thinking about it.

HIS HONOUR: I mean it’s just treating this Court with a very real disrespect if it could be thought that someone could just get in the witness box and just be selective about what they’re going to tell the Court. I’m going to close the Court. I’ll close the Court. If you want me to make non-publication orders I’ll make non-publication orders but I’m not just going to be treated this way and allow my Court to be treated this way with respect.

GOOLD: I’m not intending any disrespect and I make that clear and perhaps if I could adopt this course if I could take him to firstly some non-contentious matters and if your Honour would allow me having done that and not wasted the Court’s time to have a short conference with him at the end of the day.

HIS HONOUR: Just pause for a moment. The Crown has got rights of cross-examination remember that.

GOOLD: I’m not seeking to-

HIS HONOUR: They can’t cross-examine him on a limited basis.

GOOLD: What I’m considering is that having taken the box he is there for all purposes. I accept that and he is open to cross-examination and that will proceed in due course.

HIS HONOUR: Subject to relevant rulings upon Evidence Act matters and all the rest.

GOOLD: Indeed, I would seek your indulgence at some stage when these contentious matters we’ve just been raised now for him to get some advice as to his obligations and responsibilities because if they’re unclear he should in my submission have that opportunity before he continues his evidence and is then cross-examined.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t mean this disrespectfully to you but he should have been told all this before he got in the witness box.

GOOLD: There’s been discussions about it.

HIS HONOUR: Imagine if we had a jury here and we’re having this discussion in front of the jury, what would the tribunal of fact think of them?

GOOLD: With respect I think he was misled to a certain extent by what occurred in Mr Haynes’ proceedings where people-

HIS HONOUR: I’m not interested in, I’ve got no idea what happened in his proceedings. All I’ve got is a judgment. I haven’t got a transcript.

GOOLD: I’ve had the benefit of a transcript.

HIS HONOUR: I’m not concerned with how other proceedings are run with the greatest respect. It might have been a boat race for all I know.

GOOLD: It may well be that he wants to avail himself because of fears and because of the documents that I-

HIS HONOUR: You know what a boat race is of course?

GOOLD: Sorry?

HIS HONOUR: You know what a boat race is don’t you?

GOOLD: I know what a boat race is.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, it might have been a boat race for all I know. Everyone agreed that the prisoner could give evidence and nobody was going to challenge his version and away it would go on that basis. I don’t know. Don’t know who appeared. Haven’t got a transcript so it’s the way sometimes these things happen. There might not be any reason to dispute what his version of events was so he was allowed to give it in a particular way. I don’t know.

GOOLD: I would like to avail myself of an opportunity to speak to him.

HIS HONOUR: Of course you can speak to your client. I’m not going to deny you the chance to speak to your client anymore than I would denied the Crown the chance to speak to MH. I’m just a bit concerned about the fact that it might be thought that your client could just get in the witness box and automatically assume that he could just tell me what he wanted to tell me and not tell me anything else at least in-chief when the Crown has a right to cross-examine him and challenge his version of events if it wishes to. I don’t know. It may not. It may hear his evidence and be satisfied with his evidence and not want to ask him any questions. I don’t know.

GOOLD: It may need then a consideration of a closed court and a non-publication order.

HIS HONOUR: Is your client going to provide any more evidence about his relationship with Mr Freeman other than what I’ve heard thus far?

GOOLD: As I understand it it was not his intention to do so but if your Honour is minded to-

HIS HONOUR: I’m asking that rhetorically. It’s not for me to cross-examine him unless as the tribunal of fact I want to learn something but I don’t think I’ve learnt anything else about the association between the two men from what I’ve heard thus far. They’re friends from the Cronulla area terrific but that doesn’t tell me anything. Did they go to school together? How long have they been friends? All these things. I’m not going to draw any inferences adverse to your client because he knows somebody who might have received some publicity or might have a particular reputation or might be the son of a person with a particular reputation. That’s not the basis upon which courts operate but it’s not to be assumed that it’s satisfactorily for him to simply say I know this person. I know him from around the Cronulla area. What dining at Zimzala, going out to the Blue Parrot, meeting up at Northies every Saturday afternoon. What is the nature of the relationship between the two men? Is that going to be explained?

GOOLD: On that level, yes, that can be explained. It was in relation to-

HIS HONOUR: No, I don’t want you to give evidence. Is he going to give evidence about all this?

GOOLD: Yes but in relation to the criminal complicity of other persons including Mr Freeman. He was not intending to identify other persons who were involved.

HIS HONOUR: He should have got in the witness box and said that from the outset.

GOOLD: Perhaps he was led astray by the circumstances under which Mr Haynes’ proceedings proceeded and thought that he would be afforded the same indulgence-

HIS HONOUR: Why would he be led astray by the circumstances of Mr MH’s circumstances of giving evidence?

GOOLD: Because his circumstances on the way the matter proceeded on the evidence which was provided to me is the transcript of the remarks on sentence and the circumstances particular to this offender suggest that he would be in a better position to seek that indulgence than what MH was.

HIS HONOUR: Yes but just pause for a moment and correct me or don’t bother correcting me because I don’t know. Did MH give evidence in the context of what was said to be a disputed facts hearing?

SPEAKER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: It was a disputed facts hearing? That’s something I didn’t know.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: As to his role he gave some evidence.

HIS HONOUR: Was it a disputed facts hearing or was it simply a fellow getting out of the dock, walking over the witness box and giving 15 minutes of evidence as happens in most sentence matters and being asked a few perfunctory questions by whoever was the Crown Prosecutor and wandering back to the dock again.”


	
	Following this exchange, the solicitor for the applicant sought leave to obtain instructions from his client. The following day, the applicant sought and was granted leave to withdraw his evidence.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	It is only necessary to deal with the remarks on sentence so far as they relate to the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge referred to the refusal by the applicant to give evidence. He described the applicant’s failure to give evidence which identified particular persons involved as “somewhat absurd, given that the particular people in question were already identified in the facts”. If that was the case, one might ask rhetorically why the sentencing judge found it necessary to ask the question which led to the exchange to which we have referred above.
	
	
	The sentencing judge also said that when he was on the verge of directing the appellant to answer questions, the appellant said that he had fears for his safety. The sentencing judge said that “[t]he reason for this was not made clear”, although the sentencing judge did state that he was mindful of the police report to which we have referred in par [37] above.
	
	
	His Honour made the following remarks in respect of the failure by the applicant to give evidence:
	


“Although acknowledging there are difficulties for the prisoner in giving evidence, it must be said that it was totally unrealistic to call the prisoner to give evidence that would have been relied upon to establish facts in the case, when the witness, either on advice or of his own motion, was not prepared to give full particulars to enable his version of events to be either challenged, verified or even properly understood. In any event, the choice by him not to continue his evidence – he was granted leave to have his evidence withdrawn the following day – was his, taken on the advice of his counsel. It should be noted that I indicated to his counsel that, short of directing the prisoner to answer the questions, there were various other alternatives. I can compel the witness to answer questions. Or I could close the Court, or I could direct no publication of the evidence, or any one of those combinations.

I appreciate that his unwillingness to continue with his evidence was no sign of disrespect for the Court. On the other hand, I do not understand why the way in which the sentence proceedings of his co-accused were conducted could in any way inform the manner in which this prisoner would be allowed to give evidence in these proceedings. That MH could give evidence without disclosing any relevant details or any particular details is a matter for that sentencing judge, not a matter that assist me in any way in conducting these current proceedings. I was not given the benefit of a transcript of what occurred in the sentencing of MH, to whom I will refer shortly. In any event, ultimately, I draw no inference adverse to the prisoner by his failure to complete his evidence”


	
	Mr Haynes (sometimes referred to as MH by the sentencing judge) was one of the applicant’s co-offenders. The reference to him giving evidence without being required to disclose any particular details was a reference to the fact that the judge who sentenced Mr Haynes rejected questions asked of him in cross-examination concerning the identity of his co-offenders.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to a number of areas where, in the absence of evidence from the applicant, he could not accept submissions favourable to him, both in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant was present (at the Werris Creek property) for a number of days to contribute to the process of manufacture. The applicant pointed out that one of the issues on which his solicitor indicated he would give evidence was his involvement in the manufacturing process and particularly the fact that the applicant’s asthma prevented him from taking any active part in the process.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the evidence given by Mr Haynes at his sentencing hearing concerning the extent of his involvement and pointed out that similar details were not available for “positive conclusion” in relation to the applicant. The sentencing judge noted that it was accepted that Mr Haynes “performed fairly menial tasks”, which was presumably the “positive conclusion” to which he was referring. The sentencing judge also emphasised the absence of evidence from the applicant in the following passage:
	


“A great deal of time was spent arguing about what he would have done during the period he was at Werris Creek. It seemed to me a great deal of time was wasted on this topic. The prisoner did not assist me in this regard beyond leaving open the fact that for a lengthy period of time either side of 3 and 4 December he was incommunicado, consistent with him being on the property and deliberately turning his phone off. As the prisoner has not assisted me, primarily because of his concern about his welfare, he has provided no direct evidence other than his admission of being involved in the relevant criminal enterprise and of course the nature of the criminal enterprise.”


	
	In that context, the ultimate conclusion of the sentencing judge was that the applicant had a greater involvement in the enterprise than Mr Haynes and must have a higher starting point for his sentence than Mr Haynes.
	
	
	The sentencing judge also commented on the absence of evidence in dealing with the applicant’s motive for committing the offence and the applicant’s subjective circumstances. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that he was motivated to commit the crime to financially assist his parents, who were in dire financial circumstances. The sentencing judge rejected this submission, stating that in the absence of evidence from the applicant and details of what he was to receive, it was “not possible to conclude that the commission of the crime was for altruistic reasons”. In dealing with the consultant psychiatrist’s report which was tendered, he noted that most of the psychiatrist’s conclusions were based on untested evidence.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge’s intervention during his evidence forced him to choose between identifying the other persons in the photograph and putting his family at risk of harm, or refusing to do so, thereby facing other adverse consequences. He submitted that it was unfair for him to be put in that position.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in intervening in the manner referred to above, the sentencing judge crossed the line between excessive and unjudicial intervention and disclosure of matters of concern: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 (Chow) at 606. He pointed to the fact that the intervention by the sentencing judge was at an early stage of the applicant’s evidence in chief and well before the commencement of cross-examination of the applicant. He pointed to the fact that the Crown did not ask Detective Adams to identify the persons in the photograph and submitted that there was a real doubt about the relevance of the identification evidence in any event. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, there was a real doubt as to whether the Crown would cross-examine the applicant on that matter. He also submitted that the question asked by the sentencing judge was of doubtful relevance.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the early intervention by the sentencing judge gave rise to the appearance of unfair pre-judgment, referring in particular to that part of the remarks on sentence to which we have referred in par [43].
	
	
	The applicant pointed to the fact that the effect of what occurred was that he was unable to give evidence as to the nature of his limited participation in the enterprise, the time of his “first active involvement” and his “motivation to involve himself in the offending”. Counsel for the applicant pointed to those portions of the remarks on sentence to which we have referred above in which the sentencing judge referred to evidentiary deficiencies in the applicant’s case, stating that what occurred deprived the applicant of the opportunity of remedying those deficiencies.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that as the photograph was tendered without objection, it would have been surprising if someone did not ask the applicant to identify the persons appearing in it. However, at the hearing, the Crown accepted that, in light of the fact that the police officer was not asked to identify those persons, such identification was not a particularly important part of the Crown case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that what ultimately concerned the sentencing judge was not the identification of the persons in the photograph, but the statement by the applicant’s solicitor that his client did not intend to give evidence identifying other persons involved in the offence. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to proceed as he did and was entitled to require a witness to answer a question, unless there was a valid objection.
	
	
	At the hearing, counsel for the Crown accepted that there was nothing available to contradict the inference that the applicant declined to answer questions because of a genuine concern for his family. She also agreed that if the Court came to the view that the applicant was prevented from properly presenting his case, there would be a miscarriage of justice.
	


Consideration


	
	There have been many cases in which appellate courts have warned of the risk to a fair trial resulting from excessive intrusion by a trial judge in adversarial proceedings. The dangers which have been said to result include the inability of a judge who has descended into the arena to properly assess the demeanour of a witness and the possibility of creating the impression of pre-judgment. However, the ultimate question must always be whether the intervention was unjustifiable and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20, Lord Greene MR referred to the difficulty of the assessment of demeanour by a judge who descends into the arena and assumes the role of an advocate. His Lordship made the following remarks:
	


“A judge who observes the demeanour of the witnesses while they are being examined by counsel has from his detached position a much more favourable opportunity of forming a just appreciation than a judge who himself conducts the examination. If he takes the latter course he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have his vision clouded by the dust of the conflict. Unconsciously he deprives himself of the advantage of calm and dispassionate observation. It is further to be remarked, as everyone who has had experience of these matters knows, that the demeanour of a witness is apt to be very different when he is being questioned by the judge from what it is when he is being questioned by counsel, particularly when the judge's examination is, as it was in the present case, prolonged and covers practically the whole of the crucial matters which are in issue.”


	
	The position was considered by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in Jones v National Coal Board (1957) 2 QB 55. In that case, a judgment in favour of the respondent, in a claim brought against it for damages for personal injuries, was set aside and a new trial ordered on the basis that excessive interference by the trial judge in cross-examination led to a miscarriage of justice. Denning LJ who delivered the judgment of the Court made the following remarks at 63-65:
	


“… In the system of trial which we have evolved in this country, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of society at large …

So also it is for the advocates, each in his turn, to examine the witnesses, and not for the judge to take it on himself lest by so doing he appear to favour one side or the other: … And it is for the advocate to state his case as fairly and strongly as he can, without undue interruption, lest the sequence of his argument be lost … The judge's part in all this is to hearken to the evidence, only himself asking questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any point that has been overlooked or left obscure; to see that the advocates behave themselves seemly and keep to the rules laid down by law; to exclude irrelevancies and discourage repetition; to make sure by wise intervention that he follows the points that the advocates are making and can assess their worth; and at the end to make up his mind where the truth lies. If he goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge and assumes the robe of an advocate; and the change does not become him well. ... That is what has happened here. A judge of acute perception, acknowledged learning, and actuated by the best of motives, has nevertheless himself intervened so much in the conduct of the case that one of the parties - nay, each of them - has come away complaining that he was not able properly to put his case; and these complaints are, we think, justified.”


	
	The complaint in that case was similar to the complaint made in the present case, namely, that the appellant was unable to properly present her case.
	
	
	In Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 517, in determining whether a trial judge should have intervened when the accused did not lead certain evidence, Barwick CJ described the role of the judge as follows:
	


“It is a trial, not an inquisition: a trial in which the protagonists are the Crown on the one hand and the accused on the other. Each is free to decide the ground on which it or he will contest the issue, the evidence which it or he wiII call, and what questions whether in chief or in cross-examination shall be asked; always, of course, subject to the rules of evidence, fairness and admissibility. The judge is to take no part in that contest, having his own role to perform in ensuring the propriety and fairness of the trial and in instructing the jury in the relevant law. Upon the evidence and under the judge's directions, the jury is to decide whether the accused is guilty or not.”


	
	In Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 281-282, Kirby A-CJ, with whose reasons Meagher JA agreed, stated a series of principles concerning excessive judicial intervention. Of particular relevance are the following (at 281):
	


“1.   The test to be applied is whether the excessive judicial questioning or pejorative comments have created a real danger that the trial was unfair. If so, the judgment must be set aside: see E H Cochrane Ltd v Ministry of Transport [1987] 1 NZLR 146.

…

4.   The decision on whether the point of unfairness has been reached must be made in the context of the whole trial and in the light of the number, length, terms and circumstances of the interventions. It is important to draw a distinction between intervention which suggests that an opinion has been finally reached which could not be altered by further evidence or argument and one which is provisional, put forward to test the evidence and to invite further persuasion: see In Marriage of Lonard (1976) 26 FLR 1 at 10-11; 11 ALR 618 at 626; see discussion (1976) ACLD DT 630; cf Ex parte Prentice; Re Hornby (1969) 90 WN (NSW) (Pt 1) 427; [1970] 1 NSWR 654.

5.   It is also relevant to consider the point at which the judicial interventions complained of occur. A vigorous interruption early in the trial or in the examination of a witness may be less readily excused than one at a later stage where it is designed for the legitimate object referred to in Jones, namely of permitting the judge to better comprehend the issues and to weigh the evidence of the witness concerned. By the same token, the judge does not know what is in counsel's brief and the strength of cross-examination may be destroyed if a judge, in a desire to get to what seems crucial, at any stage prematurely intervenes by putting questions: see Yuill (at 185) and Gautier(at 117).”


	
	Chow involved an application of these principles to a sentencing hearing. Although the Crown had accepted a plea of guilty from the accused, the sentencing judge continued to question the prosecution in a manner indicating that he believed that the accused was guilty of a more serious offence. The sentencing judge sought and accepted the tender of committal depositions, over the accused’s objections, in regard to the more serious offence. The accused sought declaratory relief prior to the sentence being handed down. While the Court of Appeal found that a sentencing judge was entitled to seek further detail regarding the facts on which the accused was to be sentenced, the court held that the sentencing judge had exceeded the limits of proper judicial questioning and departed from neutrality, giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Kirby P stated at 608:
	


“I fully acknowledge his Honour's right in law to go beyond the statement of facts tendered by the parties. In protection of the public interest, he was entitled, for the performance of his sentencing function, to seek more detail about the acts for which the claimant was to be punished. The parties' agreement, and subsequent conduct, could not confine his Honour. However, in pursuing what he conceived to be his obligation, Ducker DCJ, in my respectful opinion, crossed the line which divides permissible judicial questioning from prosecutorial accusation and criminal inquisition. He contested the wisdom and justification of the prosecution's acceptance of the lesser charge. He doubted the existence of the defence to that charge, notwithstanding reference to R v Love (1989) 17 NSWLR 608. He expressed not too subtle disagreement with the approach of the prosecutor by stating that: ‘… Sometimes it needs an experienced eye to see these things’.

He repeatedly stated (although there was no evidence to support this conclusion) that the case ‘smacked of’ ‘organised crime’. He insisted on more than one occasion that: ‘There is an aroma about this matter and I want to know what it is about’. With every respect, there is missing from the transcript the elements of dispassion and neutrality that are appropriate in the performance of the judicial function, particularly in criminal matters where passion is too easily raised. The exchanges, of growing intensity and insistence on the part of his Honour, betray no inclination to accept the prosecutor's function in determining the charge and the accused's right, having pleaded to it, to have the matter dealt with upon that basis only. His repeated reference to the seriousness of the matter and indication that the accused was looking at a custodial sentence would have left an observer with a sense of real disquiet. Instead of dealing with the matter in the manner conventional to our criminal justice system, his Honour's interrogation appears much closer to that of an investigating magistrate in a civil law country. Perhaps we should have such a system. Perhaps judicial officers should be empowered to protect the public interest by an energetic, zealous pursuit of the ‘real facts’, over-riding and even reversing the judgments of prosecutors. But that is not our system or our convention. Although the line is a fine one, I am satisfied that it was crossed in this case. A reasonable apprehension of bias required the disqualification of the sentencing judge.”


	
	Similarly, in R v Capaldo [2015] SASCFC 56, the conduct of the sentencing judge in taking over the cross-examination of the offender was found to give rise to an apprehension of bias: see [14]-[15], [34]-[35].
	
	
	Although a number of these decisions seem to be based on the proposition that the conduct of the judge founded a reasonable apprehension of bias, that is not necessarily the case. A miscarriage of justice will occur in circumstances where the conduct of the judge prevents a party from properly presenting his or her case: Jones v National Coal Board. In R v T, WA [2014] SASCFC 3; (2013) 118 SASR 382 at [38], Kourakis CJ stated three ways in which a judge’s intervention may be excessive and lead to miscarriage of justice:
	


“I would state the grounds on which a judge’s intervention might vitiate a conviction a little differently, as follows:

(i)   the questioning unfairly undermines the proper presentation of a party’s case (the disruption ground);

(ii)   the questioning gives an appearance of bias (the bias ground); and

(iii)   the questioning is such an egregious departure from the role of a judge presiding over an adversarial trial that it unduly compromises the judge’s advantage in objectively evaluating the evidence from a detached distance (the dust of conflict ground).”


	
	Although we have considerable sympathy for the position in which the sentencing judge found himself, having regard to the unsatisfactory statement of facts presented to him, we are of the view that his intervention was unwarranted and deprived the applicant of the opportunity to properly present his case. This is for a number of reasons.
	
	
	The first reason is the nature of the question which led to the exchange. The photograph in question was taken the day after the last day on which the offence was said to have been committed. The question was thus of doubtful relevance. The Crown did not ask Detective Adams to identify the persons in the photograph other than the applicant and Mr Yazdani.
	
	
	The second reason is the timing of the question. The question was asked early on in the applicant’s examination in chief and well before any evidentiary issues between him and the Crown had crystallised. Further, it was asked in circumstances where the solicitor for the applicant had already informed the judge that the applicant would be reluctant to identify the other persons involved. In that context, it must be remembered that this Court, on more than one occasion, has indicated that there are good and valid reasons for drug offenders facing terms of imprisonment to be reluctant to identify their co-offenders: Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 at [27]; R v Baleisuva [2004] NSWCCA 344 at [29]. It does not seem to us that the fact that the evidence may have been given in closed court necessarily alleviates the difficulty.
	
	
	Third, and most important, is the reaction of the sentencing judge after the applicant had declined to answer the question. Without giving any consideration of the reason for the refusal, he suggested to the applicant that he was not prepared to tell the truth and that he could be in contempt of court if he declined to give evidence. The sentencing judge did not hear argument as to whether the applicant should be required to answer the question, but threatened the applicant with sanctions if he did not answer questions.
	
	
	Fourth, in making the comment cited at par [36] above, “if you’re going to get in the witness box to give evidence about your role in this matter you’re going to tell me the whole truth and you’re going to tell me the whole story and not be selective about it because otherwise what’s the value of your evidence with respect? I ask that rhetorically of you, your counsel and the Crown Prosecutor” (emphasis added), the sentencing judge misapprehended his role. As was stated in Jones v National Coal Board and Ratten, it is not the function of the judge to perform an inquisitorial role, as distinct from adjudicating on issues raised by the parties, although the judge has an entitlement to seek clarification of matters raised in evidence.
	
	
	Fifth, the police report regarding malicious damage to the motor vehicle and the threatening note were matters which the Crown conceded should have been considered.
	
	
	Sixth, the refusal to entertain any submission as to the circumstances in which Mr Haynes was not required to give similar evidence before Judge Payne and instead making a slighting comment about a boat race.
	
	
	It was these matters which caused the applicant to apply to be excused from giving further evidence. Whether or not that was a sensible course to adopt, it was understandable in all of the circumstances.
	
	
	We have identified the areas where the sentencing judge referred to the absence of evidence in rejecting submissions made on behalf of the applicant (pars [45]-[49] above). The applicant was thus prejudiced in the sentencing proceedings. There was a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	We emphasise that this judgment is not to be taken as suggesting that a witness giving evidence in sentencing hearings has discretion as to whether to answer questions where the answer might prejudice the witness or his or her immediate family. The problem in the present case arises from the nature and timing of the questions asked and, more importantly, on the approach of the sentencing judge immediately following the applicant’s refusal to answer questions.
	
	
	There remains the question of the appropriate form of relief. Neither party disputed that the Court’s power under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act was enlivened in circumstances where there was a miscarriage of justice in the sentence proceedings: R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353. As the Court is not in a position to resentence the applicant, it should exercise its power under s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to remit the sentence proceedings to the District Court for determination. It is appropriate in the present case that a direction be made that a judge other than the sentencing judge hear the proceedings: O’Neil-Shaw v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 42 at [33]-[34], [57]-[59].

		25 September 2015",2015-09-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702714,R v Obeid (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1442,"Judgment (revised from ex tempore)


	
	On 23 September 2015, the accused Edward Moses Obeid filed a notice of motion seeking an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that he be tried by a judge alone. The notice of motion was returnable on 25 September 2015 and was argued on that day. This judgment concerns that notice of motion.
	


Background


	
	On 8 May 2015, Mr Obeid was arraigned in this court on an indictment that charged him with one count of wilful misconduct in public office. He pleaded not guilty. His trial was then fixed to commence on 12 October 2015. On 21 September 2015, I varied that date so that it is now fixed to commence on 19 October 2015. I did so because I had been informed that the parties believed that the week commencing 12 October 2015 could be usefully devoted to narrowing the factual matters in dispute for the purposes of shortening the trial.
	
	
	On 7 July 2015, Johnson J dismissed an application by Mr Obeid for an order that he be tried by judge alone: R v Obeid [2015] NSWSC 897 (“Obeid (No 1”)). His Honour ordered that there be a non-publication order under s 10 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 in respect of that application and the judgment in Obeid (No 1).
	
	
	On 8 July 2015, his Honour made a similar order prohibiting the publication of the listing of Mr Obeid's trial. Since that time, such orders have been made in respect of all interlocutory proceedings and judgments, including this one.
	
	
	Mr Obeid filed an application for leave to appeal from Obeid (No 1) under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. His application was listed to be heard on 29 August 2015. However, in the days prior to that application being heard the Crown served a proposed amended indictment and amended Crown Case Statement. On 26 August 2015, the application for leave to appeal was adjourned on the basis that a fresh application for a judge-alone trial would or at least might be made.
	
	
	In the meantime, on 9 September 2015 leave was granted to the Crown to file the amended indictment. However, at that time, Mr Obeid raised a demurrer to the amended indictment and otherwise sought to quash it or stay the proceedings in respect of it.
	
	
	On 22 September 2015 I overruled his demurrer and otherwise dismissed his notice of motion seeking to quash the indictment or stay the proceedings: R v Obeid (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1380 (“Obeid (No 2)”).
	
	
	In Obeid (No 2) at [14] to [21] I set out the terms of the amended indictment and the nature of the Crown case. I will not repeat those paragraphs. This judgment should be read together with the judgment in Obeid (No 2) as well as the judgment in Obeid (No 1).
	


Sections 130A and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986


	
	This being Mr Obeid's second application for a trial by judge alone, an issue arises as to the operation of s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act. Along with s 132 it provides:
	


“130A Pre-trial orders and orders made during trial bind trial Judge

(1)   A pre-trial order made by a Judge in proceedings on indictment is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(2)   If, on an appeal against a conviction for an offence in proceedings on indictment, a new trial is ordered, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to the proceedings from which the conviction arose is binding on the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings unless:

   (a)   in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for that order to be binding, or

   (b)   that order is inconsistent with an order made on appeal.

(3)   If proceedings on indictment before a trial Judge are discontinued for any reason, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to those proceedings is binding on a trial Judge hearing any subsequent trial proceedings relating to the same offence as the discontinued proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the subsequent trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(4)   In this section, pre-trial order means any order made or given after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial.

(5)   To avoid doubt, this section extends to a ruling given on the admissibility of evidence.

…

132 Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1)   An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2)   The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3)   If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4)   If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5)   Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6)   The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)   The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

   (a)   there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

   (b)   the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.”


	
	Senior counsel for Mr Obeid on this application, Mr James QC, submitted that s 130A had no application at this point because Johnson J made no “pre-trial order” as a consequence of Obeid (No 1), but instead “declined to make an order under s 132”. However, the relevant order of his Honour was the order dismissing Mr Obeid’s notice of motion filed 19 May 2015 seeking a judge-only trial: Obeid (No 1) at [98]. It is that order which is the subject of the application for leave to appeal. It follows that that order is binding on me as the trial judge unless I consider that it is “in the interests of justice” that it should not be so: s 130A(1).
	
	
	Otherwise underlying the debate on this application was an issue as to the approach to be taken to s 130A(1). It can be accepted that the phrase “interests of justice” is a commonly employed phrase which has been held to be of wide import and comprehend many factors (see State of Western Australia v Rayney [2011] WASC 326; 42 WAR 383. Hence, that phrase is also to be found in s 132(4). However, context is important and the present context involves the deployment of that phrase as the threshold for revisiting a matter already determined. In that context, the “interests of justice” extends to the necessity to avoid the unnecessary re-agitation of matters already determined so as to avoid a waste of resources, and to respect principles of finality even in respect of a matter determined on an interlocutory basis.
	
	
	In my view the starting point for an application to which s 130A applies is to consider whether there has been some material change in circumstances since the previous ruling. This is the approach adopted for the revisiting of interlocutory orders in civil proceedings (see Douglas v John Fairfax & Sons Limited [1983] 3 NSWLR 126 at [134]). In so stating I do not consider the necessity to demonstrate a material change in circumstance exhausts the circumstances in which the interests of justice may warrant a departure from an earlier order.
	
	
	Mr James QC made a number of submissions directed to why it should be concluded that the interests of justice warrant a departure from the outcome of Obeid (No 1) and, in particular, a conclusion that it is not binding. I will address those submissions. Some of the matters put forward are consistent with what I have just stated as to the scope of s 130A, but some are not. However, I note that one aspect of his submissions appears to rise to the level of contending that I should simply address the matter entirely afresh, and if I come to a different conclusion to that of Johnson J then it would follow that “the interests of justice” would justify giving effect to that different view. I do not consider that approach is correct. If it were, then s 130A would be rendered otiose. However, out of an abundance of caution and in deference to the points made, I will also address the matter on that basis.
	
	
	Before outlining the reasoning of Johnson J in Obeid (No 1) and addressing the matters put forward in support of the application, I note that the parties appear to have overlooked that s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act precludes this application being made without leave as it was made less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial. However, given that the application was foreshadowed outside the 28 day period, I consider that such leave should be granted: Obeid (No 1).
	


Obeid (No 1)


	
	In Obeid (No 1) at [26] Johnson J cited his own judgment in R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357 at [27] to [39] concerning the principles relevant to an application for trial by judge alone. I respectfully adopt, and to the extent necessary will apply, his Honour's synthesis of some of the relevant principles.
	
	
	The basis for the application for a trial by judge alone before Johnson J was the sustained adverse publicity that Mr Obeid had been subjected to over a number of years. A number of affidavits were read before his Honour evidencing that publicity. Those affidavits together with additional affidavits were read on this application. I will return to consider them afresh shortly.
	
	
	In Obeid (No 1), Johnson J summarised the submissions concerning the effect of that material at [33] to [37], [42] to [45] and [101]. In relation to that material, his Honour found that there had been a “steady flow of adverse media publicity that had surrounded [Mr Obeid] for some years” at [53]. However, his Honour also accepted at [65] that “there has been a falling off in the publicity concerning [Mr Obeid]” in that it peaked in 2013, commenced to drop off in 2014, with a further peak at the time of the ICAC report concerning him, but with a steady drop off in 2015.
	
	
	His Honour considered that the reduction in the adverse publicity concerning Mr Obeid was “significant” and was indicative of a “fade factor” being a circumstance in which the effect of adverse publicity concerning an event or person fades over time.
	
	
	In Obeid (No 1) his Honour referred to the capacity of jurors to disregard extraneous publicity and prejudicial material. Ultimately, his Honour concluded as follows (at [74] to [76]):
	


“I am satisfied that some steps may be taken in this case to reduce the impact of publicity, at the very least by maintenance of the non-publication order concerning this application. These steps should be considered, in conjunction with the strong directions which will undoubtedly be given by the trial judge in advance of empanelment of a jury, and after empanelment together with the operation of s 68C Jury Act 1977.

I am satisfied that these measures will serve to assist a fair trial of the Applicant.

I do consider that the adverse media and other publicity requires, in the interests of justice, an order for trial by judge alone in this case.”


	
	His Honour then addressed other matters that bore upon this application especially the issues likely to arise at trial.
	
	
	Bearing in mind s 132(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act his Honour found that “there is scope for consideration of objective community standards in determination of issues in the trial” at [88]; and concluded that “the likely issues in the trial include significant matters which are appropriate for determination by a jury”, at [94].
	
	
	The issues that his Honour was referring to included the third element of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office as stated by Redlich JA in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 at [22], namely, whether Mr Obeid wilfully misconducted himself by breaching his duty as a member of the legislative council (see Obeid (No 1) at [86]), and the fifth element, namely, whether the misconduct is “serious and meriting criminal punishment”, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and office-holder, the importance of the public objects which they serve, and the nature and extent of departure from those objects (Obeid (No 1) at [87]).
	
	
	His Honour also identified that “at the trial it would be necessary for a jury to undertake an assessment” of the credibility of some of the witnesses; Obeid (No 1) at [93].
	
	
	At this point it is appropriate to address a number of submissions that were made by Mr James QC concerning Obeid (No 1).
	
	
	In support of this application, the Court was provided with Mr Obeid's written submissions in support of his application for leave to appeal from the judgment in Obeid (No 1). That said, Mr James QC said that no part of this application involved a revisitation of Obeid (No 1) as though this Court were sitting on appeal or some form of quasi appeal from that judgment. The Court was asked to note but not resolve the issues raised by the submissions that were lodged with the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	However, the written submissions in support of this application nevertheless contended that his Honour's judgment in Obeid (No 1) was “flawed and should not be followed”. In oral submissions Mr James QC maintained that contention. The matters put in support of that contention are outlined in the written submissions of Mr Obeid on this application at [40] to [42].
	
	
	The first matter is said to be that the finding in Obeid (No 1) at [76] that his Honour did “not consider that the adverse media and other publicity requires, in the interests of justice, an order for trial by judge alone” involved a misstatement of the relevant test. Mr James QC explained that this contention was to the effect that his Honour erred by imposing an onus or burden on Mr Obeid to show why a trial by jury should not be ordered (see R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 at [96]. This contention is misconceived.
	
	
	Before his Honour could have concluded that an order for a judge-alone trial was warranted, his Honour had to be positively satisfied that it was “in the interests of justice” to so order. The relevant part of his Honour's reasons in Obeid (No 1) merely records that his Honour was not so satisfied.
	
	
	The second complaint set out in the written submissions in support of this application was that in concluding that there were factual issues involving the application of objective community standards that would arise at Mr Obeid's trial, Johnson J failed to specifically identify them. That contention is also misconceived. I have already outlined the matters that his Honour clearly identified.
	
	
	The third complaint was to the effect that if issues such as intention, dishonesty and credibility which his Honour referred to in Obeid (No 1) militate against making an order for a judge-alone trial, then there would be little room for s 132’s operation. However, despite the attempts in the course of submissions to wish s 132(5) out of existence, it has stubbornly remained in the section. The section evinces a clear preference on the part of Parliament for the determination by juries of the factual issues referred to in s 132(5) in trials concerning serious criminal charges. That matter is not determinative but it is clearly of significance to any application for a judge-alone trial.
	
	
	It follows that none of the asserted “flaws” in Johnson J’s judgment in Obeid (No 1) have any substance. Generally I note that I have serious misgivings about such issues even being raised on this application. Once it was accepted (as it had to be) that this is not a forum to appeal his Honour's judgment, then in my view the submission that it was flawed should not have been pursued.
	


Publicity


	
	As noted, on this application the affidavits read before Johnson J were read again, as well as additional affidavits updating the position in relation to publicity concerning Mr Obeid since July 2015. Given that one matter relied on is the cumulative effect of adverse publicity over time, it is appropriate to summarise the entirety of that material all of which I have considered.
	
	
	In describing this material, I note that the principal focus of Mr Obeid's contention on this application concerns the publicity surrounding the findings made against him by the Independent Commission against Corruption, (“ICAC”), in various enquiries to the effect that he was corrupt and that the overall effect of the material is said to be that he was a corrupt person.
	
	
	According to his written submissions there have been a number of ICAC enquiries in the last three years that have resulted in findings of corrupt conduct against Mr Obeid, namely Operation “Jasper”, Operation “Cabot”, and Operation “Meeka”, as well as Operation “Cyrus” which concerns the events the subject of these proceedings. ICAC's report on Operation Cyrus was published in June 2014.
	
	
	In his affidavit sworn 24 September 2015, Mr Obeid's solicitor Mr Breene explained that he had caused to be conducted various media searches of the Australian print and electronic media for the period 14 May 2015 to 22 September 2015 using the terms “Eddie Obeid”, “corrupt”, “criminal”, or “guilty”. This search revealed 110 press articles and 56 television or radio excerpts. Annexed to Mr Breene's affidavit is a listing of the articles and the newspapers they were published in, as well as a listing of some of the headlines.
	
	
	It is apparent from the listings that a number of the articles and broadcasts are a republication of each other. Many were published or broadcast out of metropolitan Sydney, and a number of them related to proceedings commenced by Mr Obeid himself: “Obeid sues State Government”. Copies of some of the print articles are attached to Mr Breene's affidavit. None of those articles concern the events the subject of these proceedings. Instead they address a variety of topics including the proceedings commenced by Mr Obeid, other civil proceedings, and matters of public comment concerning ICAC generally. Within many of those articles are brief passages which either refer to the fact that findings of corruption were made against Mr Obeid or add the adjective “corrupt” or “disgraced” in front of his name, or both.
	
	
	Mr Breene also annexed to his affidavit a transcript of an electronic broadcast which was available online: ""Corruption Watch Dog ICAC Costing NSW Taxpayers Millions in Legal Fees"". The same observations apply to that broadcast.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Breene annexes a table of media articles appearing in the print media between 20 June 2014 and 22 September 2015 that report on the making of corrupt findings by ICAC against Mr Obeid. The full articles are not made available except to the extent they were included in the material just noted. There are 29 such references. The last such reference was in an article published on 9 July 2015 which related to a different enquiry to the ICAC enquiry that led to the subject charge. The last reference to the events the subject of this charge in the articles was on 9 May 2015, which was the day after Mr Obeid appeared in this court to be arraigned. The article was reporting on that event.
	
	
	This material reveals that for almost five months there has been almost no fresh reporting of any matter connecting Mr Obeid adversely to the events the subject of these proceedings. There has not been any specific article that has dealt in depth with any suggestion that Mr Obeid was corrupt. However, there still have been a number of references in articles to his being corrupt or otherwise “disgraced”, and there have been references to the fact that ICAC has made findings to that effect concerning him generally.
	
	
	Mr Breene's affidavit sworn 24 September 2015 also annexes an article that is available online from the website of The Sydney Morning Herald dated 1 December 2012 which refers to one of its journalists having received an award for reporting on Mr Obeid. Apparently within that article there is a link to an article written by that journalist dated 19 May 2012 which addresses the events the subject of these proceedings. Prior to any trial, it is to be hoped that the article will be removed. However, as I will explain, it is not really contested on this application that if a potential juror wished to view prejudicial material concerning Mr Obeid by making searches online they could do so.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Breene's affidavit sworn 24 September 2015 contains a “Google trending analysis” for the period January 2011 to September 2015 concerning the phrases “Eddie Obeid”, “Obeid”, “Ian Macdonald”, “Luke Foley” and “Mike Baird”. As I understand, the last two names are included as two points of comparison.
	
	
	The trend analysis shows a substantial spike in searches on “Eddie Obeid” or “Obeid” in January 2013, with little interest for the other names. From that time the interest in “Eddie Obeid” or “Obeid” wanes. In early 2014 interest in Mr Baird increased rapidly, which is not surprising given it coincided with him becoming Premier. The same applies to Mr Foley who became leader of the opposition around January 2015.
	
	
	Finally in his affidavit sworn 24 September 2015, Mr Breene recounts that he caused to be conducted an enquiry of the Google search engine to ascertain the number of hits on various search terms associated with Mr Obeid.
	
	
	For example, the search term “Eddie Obeid” and “corrupt” yielded approximately 13,800 hits. It is noticeable that the number of hits yielded by this search in September 2015 is significantly less than those for the same search terms undertaken in May 2014 to which I will shortly refer. How many of these hits actually yielded articles on the topic that was being searched for is not known.
	
	
	Before Johnson J, and on this application, an affidavit of Robert Oliver Szuszkiewicz sworn 19 May 2015 was read. He recorded that in March 2015 a number of posters were placed on telegraph poles in the Rockdale area with pictures of Mr Obeid and a Federal Liberal politician inviting voters to “Teach them both a lesson”. The timing of the posters coincided with the State election. It is not suggested that the posters remained in place for any significant period.
	
	
	An affidavit of Mr Breene sworn 19 May 2015 annexed a search of the Australian press concerning the terms “Eddie Obeid” and “corrupt” or “criminal” for the period 1 January 2012 to 13 May 2015. The search revealed 1,800 press articles and 2,004 TV and radio articles. Copies of a number of those articles are annexed to his affidavit from pages 215 to 615. I have reviewed those pages. In broad terms they chronicle Mr Obeid’s time before ICAC to his appearance in this court from early 2015 to May 2015. The articles are generally prominently placed in the newspapers and are always adverse to him. They included articles on the events the subject of these proceedings although not many.
	
	
	In his affidavit Mr Breene also recounts that he caused to be conducted an inquiry of the Google search engine of the kind he later conducted in September 2015. He searched to ascertain the number of hits on various search terms associated with Mr Obeid. For example, for the phrases “Eddie Obeid” and “corrupt”, this search yielded 20,600 hits compared with 13,800 hits in September 2015.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Breene obtained searches on the social media sites Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in respect of the phrase “Eddie Obeid”. He exhibited over 200 pages of printed-out commentary from those sites concerning Mr Obeid. I have reviewed that material. It is generally abusive.
	
	
	Mr Breene also obtained and annexed various printouts from the website of the publisher of the book “He who must be Obeid”, as well as 20 pages of printouts from the websites www.goodreads.com; www.booktopia.com.au; www.amazon.com and www.dymocks.com.au. I have reviewed that material. The websites contain commentary on the book which expressly or implicitly agrees with its premise that Mr Obeid used his public position to advance his financial interests.
	
	
	Mr Breene swore an affidavit on 25 May 2015. Exhibited to that affidavit is a copy of the book “He who must be Obeid”. The book was tendered on this application.
	
	
	After oral argument concluded the Court was provided with a schedule of particular portions of the book to consider. I have considered those portions and reviewed the book generally. Its overriding theme is that Mr Obeid used his position and influence over others to advance his financial interests. It uses pejorative language (“Edward Moses Obeid, OAM, was also the most corrupt politician the country has ever seen” page 1; “The Obeids’ duplicity and treachery was unfathomable”, page 358). Only a small portion of the book's 388 pages of text dealt with the events the subject of these proceedings, being mostly chapter 16.
	
	
	The evidence produced by the Crown established the book was unavailable for sale between August 2014 and December 2014. Otherwise there is no evidence as to its level of distribution or sales.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn 25 June 2015, Mr Breene recounted the results of searching Google trends which is no different to the search annexed to his affidavit sworn 24 September 2015. It annexes press articles that were published between 14 May 2015 and 25 June 2015, whose effect has already been described, he also annexed a report of ICAC Inspector Mr David Levine, as well as the terms of reference of the review panel into the Independent Commission against Corruption Act 1988 (“ICAC Act”) which was chaired by the Honourable Murray Gleeson SC.
	
	
	Mr Breene annexed Mr Obeid's Wikipedia page which included a number of references to the outcome of ICAC enquiries so far as they concern him. He also annexed a copy of the judgment of Foster J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cascade Coal Pty Limited and Ors [2015] FCA 607 in which his Honour declined to make a non-publication order in respect of parts of the statement of claim in those proceedings which concern Mr Obeid and members of his family.
	
	
	On 8 July 2015, Mr Szuszkiewicz swore an affidavit annexing certain articles published on or about 8 or 9 May 2015 which referred to the listing of this matter for trial in October 2015. Again, some of the articles applied the adjective “disgraced” to Mr Obeid.
	
	
	The Crown read six affidavits of Jessica Chan. The relevant parts of those affidavits were as follows:
	
	
	In the most recent affidavit sworn 23 September 2015, Ms Chan included her own Google trend search results for “Eddie Obeid” which yielded a similar result to that of Mr Breene's, namely a spike in interest in late 2013 and a diminished interest since then.
	
	
	She also confirmed the last of the material on ICAC's website concerning Operation Cyrus, being an enquiry into the subject matter of these proceedings, was removed on 18 September 2015.
	
	
	In her affidavit sworn 29 May 2015, Ms Chan analysed the 1,800 articles referred to in Mr Breene's affidavit of 19 May 2015 as follows.
	
	
	First, of the 1,800 newspaper articles forming exhibit TJB1 to that affidavit, she deduced that 485 of them were both published within metropolitan Sydney and had Mr Obeid and ICAC as the primary subject of the article and referred to Mr Obeid in an inflammatory manner.
	
	
	Second, of the 1,085 unique articles, that is articles that were not duplicates of each other, published in a newspaper with a Sydney distribution, she identified that the peak period for published articles was reached during 2013, this reduced slightly in 2014, and there was a marked drop off relatively in the first five months of 2015.
	
	
	Third, of the 485 articles published within the metropolitan Sydney area that had Mr Obeid and ICAC as the primary or secondary subject of the article, again the peak publications occurred in 2013, lessened in 2014 and significantly reduced in the first five months of 2015.
	
	
	Fourth, of the 2004 news radio broadcasts which made reference to Mr Obeid, she deduced that 1,098 concerned broadcasts that were within the Sydney metropolitan area, and of those 1,098, the peak occurred in 2013, namely 580. It lessened in 2014, 436, and there was a significant reduction in the first five months of 2015, namely 43.
	
	
	This review of the material bears out the findings of Johnson J in Obeid (No 1) at [53], namely, that there has been a “steady flow of adverse media publicity” concerning Mr Obeid over a number of years, but that there has also been a significant diminution in that publicity in the course of 2015, especially since he was arraigned (see Obeid (No 1) at [65]).
	
	
	In particular there has been relatively little publicity since May 2015 of any material concerning the events the subject of these proceedings or of ICAC's findings concerning those events, although in the articles concerning other topics there are repeated references made to Mr Obeid being “corrupt” or “disgraced”, and in some cases to his having been found to be corrupt.
	
	
	As noted, on this application there has been a focus on this latter aspect, in particular, it is contended the effect of the publicity is such that it would re-enforce in a jury panel's mind that Mr Obeid is generally corrupt and that in fact he has been found to be so by a body with public standing, indeed one of a quasi-judicial nature which is presided over by former judges. In view of that contention, I will address this aspect of the publicity further by making three points.
	
	
	The first is that I consider it very unlikely that members of the jury panel will have any recollection or understanding, much less any detailed recollection or understanding, of so much of the publications described above that concerns the events the subject of these proceedings. Those events are anything but notorious or famous.
	
	
	However, it is also clear that if a juror was so minded they could locate material concerning those events, possibly including ICAC's findings, by searching on the internet. Of itself, that conclusion does not advance the application for a trial by judge alone very far. Such an enquiry by a juror would constitute an offence under s 68C of the Jury Act 1977, and it would be a flagrant violation of the directions that will be given at trial. Further, it is to be noted, given that there has been no publication of the listing of Mr Obeid's trial, there is little or no reason to conclude that any prospective juror would be making such enquiries.
	
	
	Second, given the number of articles and the level of commentary, and notwithstanding the recent diminution in the level of publicity, it seems likely that the members of the jury panel, or at least some of them, will have been exposed to adverse publicity concerning Mr Obeid including material labelling him as corrupt or disgraced.
	
	
	Third, there is also a reasonable possibility that members of the jury panel, or at least some of them, would be aware that he has been so labelled by a body with at least some form of public standing, namely, ICAC, although it is less likely that they will be aware of the status of the person who presided over ICAC, or any specific connection between those findings and the subject matter of these proceedings, bearing in mind that both of those features was not a prominent aspect of publicity during any of the relevant periods.
	
	
	In considering the effect of this material upon the determination of whether the “interests of justice” favour a judge-alone trial, regard must be had to the means to allay their effect on a fair trial: R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [43] per Barr AJ.
	
	
	Those means include, but are not restricted to, advising members of the jury panel to apply to be excused if they consider there is a matter affecting their capacity to decide the matter impartially, especially any prejudicial view they hold concerning the accused, and repeatedly directing the jury that they must solely restrict themselves in their deliberations to the evidence and the submissions advanced in the courtroom and put aside anything they have heard outside it.
	
	
	It is to be remembered that this is not a trial in which the Crown would lead material that, although highly relevant by its subject matter, is likely to prejudice a jury against the accused. Nor is it a matter where the alleged crime itself has achieved any notoriety such that a juror may believe they already know the supposedly salient or even sensational facts, and something about the accused’s connection with them. Instead, the concern raised by the material is knowledge or suspicion of a prejudicial tendency or characteristic of the accused, namely, to be corrupt. In my view that is precisely the type of concern which the measures I have identified will be effective against. This precise position was addressed by the statement by Kirby ACJ in R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450, 453 to 454 as follows:
	


“Courts will assume that jurors, properly instructed, will accept and conform to the direction of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before them in the court: see Demirok (1977) 137 CLR 20 at 22. There is an increasing body of judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled.”


	
	This passage reflects the collective wisdom of numerous decisions emphasising the experience of the Courts as to the capacity and propensity of jurors to approach their tasks in accordance with their oaths by deciding the matter only according to the evidence that is to be adduced in accordance with the directions they are given (see R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258 at [17]; John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [103]).
	
	
	Consistent with this, I do not consider that the publicity that has been directed at Mr Obeid displaying the characteristics that I have stated is such that there is an appreciable risk that jurors will not act in accordance with the directions they are given and imperil a fair trial.
	


Amended indictment and approach to primary facts


	
	At this point it is appropriate to address one matter raised on behalf of Mr Obeid as warranting a reconsideration of Johnson J’s refusal to make an order for a trial by judge alone, namely, the grant of leave to the Crown to rely on an amended indictment.
	
	
	The previous form of indictment is set out in Obeid (No 1) at [3], and the Crown Case Statement said to reflect that indictment is set out in Obeid (No 1) at [19].
	
	
	The relevant change is that whereas the previous indictment alleged Mr Obeid encouraged Mr Dunn to cause the Maritime Authority to deal favourably with the lessees, the amended indictment alleges that he made “representations” to Mr Dunn to secure an advantage for the lessees without disclosing his interest in the leases to Mr Dunn.
	
	
	The version of the Crown Case Statement that accompanied the previous version of the indictment referred to Mr Dunn having been informed of Mr Obeid's interest in the leases. These references have been deleted from the version that accompanies the amended indictment.
	
	
	However, the earlier version of the Crown Case Statement also included, as an alternative, an allegation that Mr Obeid misused his position in communicating with Mr Dunn “irrespective of whether [Mr] Dunn understood that Edward Obeid had a financial interest” in the leases (see [29] set out in Obeid (No 1) at [19]).
	
	
	Thus, in this respect the amended indictment reflects a case that is a refinement rather than a change to the case previously propounded by the Crown.
	
	
	In any event, none of these changes has any bearing on the judgment in Obeid (No 1). Nothing in that judgment turned upon these aspects of the Crown case. They do not bear upon his Honour's assessment of the significance of the publicity or the nature of the factual issues the jury were likely to address especially his Honour's characterisation of them as “factual issues that require the application of objective community standards” (s 132(5)).
	
	
	Since Obeid (No 1), the Court has been advised that based on discussions between counsel it is anticipated that there will be agreement on various factual matters that may shorten the length of the trial.
	
	
	Mr James QC's written submissions on this application stated that the “approach is such that it is unlikely that questions of credit, which might fall within the traditional role of the jury will arise” (at [11]). This approach is certainly to be encouraged but at the moment it is only an aspiration rather than a reality. Further, in the Crown's written submissions on this application, reference is made to a number of witnesses who the Crown proposes to call who to date have been unwilling to cooperate with the Crown. These include members of Mr Obeid's extended family.
	
	
	The Crown submissions indicate that it intends to apply under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 for leave to cross-examine these witnesses. It seems that that application is likely to be opposed.
	
	
	It is not necessary to enter into any debate over the use of that provision at this point. Suffice to state that the calling by the Crown of witnesses who to date have been uncooperative suggests there are still likely to be witnesses whose credit on some matters may be in doubt, and that there are matters of primary fact for the jury to consider including by reference to their observation of the manner in which some witnesses give evidence.
	


Objective community standards


	
	As stated in Obeid (No 1) at [90], Johnson J concluded that the issues raised by the third and fifth elements of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office were “issues that required the application of objective community standards”. I address these elements in some detail in Obeid (No 2), especially at [108] to [110] in relation to wilful misconduct and [111] to [121] in relation to whether the misconduct is serious. Further, in Obeid (No 2) at [63] to [85] I address the underlying issue of the scope and nature of the public duty owed by an MLC. In my respectful view, the discussion of those matters in Obeid (No 2) only serves to demonstrate the correctness of this aspect of Obeid (No 1).
	
	
	A number of points were raised concerning this aspect of the matter by Mr James QC which I will address.
	
	
	First, Mr James QC contended that by their professional training and experience judges are just as well equipped or even better equipped to make judgments on factual issues of this kind compared to juries. However, whether or not that is so is irrelevant. As I have stated, while the existence of such an issue is not determinative of these applications, s 132(5) evinces a clear parliamentary preference that such issues should be determined by juries in cases where persons are charged with serious criminal offences (see R v Belghar at [96], [97] and [100] per McClellan CJ at CL).
	
	
	Second, Mr James QC placed reliance on the judgment in Greiner v ICAC (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 as having a significant bearing on this issue. In Greiner an issue arose concerning the identification of the standards relevant to an assessment of whether the conduct of a premier and a minister constituted reasonable grounds for their dismissal so as to satisfy s 9(1)(c) of the ICAC Act. In his written submissions Mr James QC pointed to a passage in Greiner in which Gleeson CJ stated that such standards must be identified and applied but not created (at 147). Priestley JA made an observation to the same effect (at 171). As I understand it, the relevance of this is said to be that the task of identifying such standards is therefore not suitable for a jury but only for a judge.
	
	
	In part that contention is foreclosed by s 132(5). Otherwise it overlooks Obeid (No 2). In Obeid (No 2) at [76] I identified the scope of the directions that would be given to a jury in relation to the functions and duties of an MLC. Thus at one level the task of identifying the standards has been undertaken by a judge and the jury will be instructed accordingly. Further, I also identified the nature of the inquiry that must be undertaken to determine whether a breach was wilful (Obeid (No 2) at [108]). Further, the formulation of the fifth element identifies the factors for the jury to consider in determining whether it is made out. Hence, in this case the jury will not simply be left to provide a subjective opinion on the appropriateness or otherwise of Mr Obeid's conduct.
	
	
	Mr James QC also submitted that the nature of the pre-trial publicity will have the effect “predicted by Priestley JA and restated by Gleeson CJ in Greiner”. I understand this to be a contention that the more the elements of the offence require an assessment to be undertaken by reference to community standards, the more likely they will be influenced by an adverse view of Mr Obeid derived from pre-trial adverse publicity. However, that contention travels no higher than being another alleged instance of the potential for an unfair trial based on adverse publicity, a matter I have already addressed.
	
	
	Third, at one point in his written submissions Mr James QC contended that Greiner stated the parameters of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office, at least for the purposes of these proceedings. It does not. Greiner did not involve any consideration of this offence and did not otherwise concern the standards applicable to parliamentarians who have not been commissioned as ministers of the Crown. The relevant discussion of the standards applicable to parliamentarians for these proceedings is set out in Obeid (No 2) at [63] to [85].
	


Conclusion on section 130A


	
	I return to s 130A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act and the question of whether in the court's opinion it would not be in the interests of justice for Johnson J’s order to be binding.
	
	
	The matters said to warrant consideration of his Honour's orders were the change in the Crown case as exemplified in the amended indictment, the likelihood of fewer or even no disputes over matters of primary fact, the supposedly flawed nature of the judgment in Obeid (No 1) and the fact that the orders made by Johnson J are currently the subject of challenge in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	It follows from the above that none of these matters considered individually or collectively warrant a conclusion that it is in the interests of justice for his Honour's orders not to be binding. The amendment of the indictment and the consequential “changes” to the Crown case are immaterial to a determination of whether a trial by judge alone should be ordered. The prospects of agreement over many matters of primary fact remain just that, and it is nevertheless likely that there will still be a number of such matters for the jury to consider. The alleged flaws in Obeid (No 1) that were raised before this court are without merit. The fact that orders made as a consequence of Obeid (No 1) are under challenge is irrelevant. They remain valid unless and until they are set aside.
	


Fresh consideration


	
	Nevertheless, contrary to my preferred view as to the operation of s 130A(1), I will reconsider the matter afresh. I have reviewed the entirety of the factual material concerning the adverse publicity and the arguments put in support of the application for trial by judge alone. Having considered that material, I will address the various factors that bear upon an assessment of whether it is in the interests of justice to order a trial by judge alone (see R v Simmons, R v Moore No 4 [2015] NSWSC 259; “Simmons”). In doing so I accept that there is no presumption in favour of a trial by jury (Simmons [55] to [57]), although, as stated, the court still needs to be affirmatively satisfied that it is in the “interests of justice” to so order.
	
	
	I have already addressed the effect of the adverse publicity and the significance of the directions that will be given to the jury. Further, I accept that Mr Obeid's preference for a trial by judge alone is a matter to be considered (Simmons at [58] to [60]), although it is not determinative. In this case I accept that there is a genuine basis for Mr Obeid to have concern about the effect of adverse publicity on his capacity to obtain a fair trial, although for the reasons I have stated I do not consider that there is an appreciable risk that there will not be a fair trial if it is held in front of a jury.
	
	
	Even if the efficiencies of a trial by judge alone are a matter that can be considered (Simmons at [67]), I do not accept they would make much difference to this matter. The trial is likely to be relatively short by this court's standards. Any reduction in the length of the hearing that would be derived from the matter proceeding by way of a judge alone trial is likely to be counterbalanced by the time involved in writing a judgment concerning the outcome. There may be an unresolved question as to whether the determination of factual issues, such as credibility, are truly matters that tend in favour of a trial by jury compared to trial by judge alone (see Simmons at [73] to [82]). I will assume in Mr Obeid's favour that they do not.
	
	
	Mr James QC submitted that one advantage of a judge alone trial would be that the parties would have the benefit of reasons which in a matter such as this would aid transparency (see Simmons No 4 at [70]). There is some force in this, but I do not consider that it adds much to the application. The Crown case is not particularly complex factually. The nature of the defence case is not yet known. At least in the event of a conviction then the path to that result should be apparent from the structure of the directions in the summing-up. When the defence case is outlined the same observations may apply in respect of an acquittal.
	
	
	There remains the issue posed by s 132(5). Even if one assumes in Mr Obeid's favour that the issue of whether any breach by him was wilful or not is not a matter which falls within s 132(5), the issue presented by determination of the fifth element most certainly answers the description of a “factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards”. If ever there was a significant issue for a jury to apply objective community standards in hearing a serious criminal charge, it is in the application of the fifth element of the crime of wilful misconduct in public office, especially as it applies to parliamentarians.
	
	
	When proper regard is had to that matter in the context of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as well as to my earlier findings concerning the adverse publicity and my assessment of the other relevant factors, the result is that I am not satisfied that it is “in the interests of justice” to order a trial by judge alone.
	


Section 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act


	
	Against the contingency that I might dismiss the application, Mr James QC submitted that I should certify this matter as a proper one for appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The principles governing such an application are set out in Pellegrino v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2008] NSWCCA 17, 71 NSWLR 96 [5] to [9]. In particular, I must exercise caution in doing so as certification precludes the Court of Criminal Appeal from considering whether a grant of leave is appropriate or not. In circumstances where the application to certify is opposed and where the appropriateness of the matter being appealed is not beyond doubt, I decline to certify.
	


Orders


	
	In addition to dismissing Mr Obeid's application, I will list the matter for mention a week before the trial to ascertain its progress and will grant the parties liberty to apply.
	
	
	Further, I note that just prior to hearing this matter I heard an application for the court to certify the orders made in Obeid (No 2) under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In the course of that application another senior counsel appearing for Mr Obeid suggested for the first time that there may be an application to exclude some of the Crown's evidence on the basis that its adducement involves a breach of parliamentary privilege. It needs to be clearly understood that any such application should be made prior to the trial commencing.
	
	
	Accordingly, the court orders that:
	



	
	The accused be granted leave under s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act to apply for an order for a trial by judge alone up to and including 23 September 2015.
	
	
	The accused's notice of motion filed 23 September 2015 be dismissed.
	
	
	The proceedings be listed for directions at 9.30am on 12 October 2015.
	
	
	There be liberty to apply on one day's notice.

		28 June 2016",2015-09-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702716,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v McKellar [2015] NSWLC 23,"Judgment


	
	The defendant is charged with the offence of engaging in sexual intercourse with a person aged over 14 years but less than 16 years. The offence was committed between 1 and 15 February 2014. The victim was aged 15 at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The charge is brought pursuant to section 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is an offence that carries a maximum sentence on conviction of 10 years imprisonment. The prosecution, in this case the Director of Public Prosecutions, makes no election to proceed on indictment. As a consequence the maximum sentence available in the Local Court is, by virtue of s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, 2 years imprisonment. The decision to proceed summarily does not affect the objective seriousness of the offence. So much is made clear in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. The offence is to be considered from the perspective of the principles set out by the High Court in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25.
	
	
	Although a plea of guilty was entered on 9 June 2015 to an offence charged as having been committed between 1 and 15 February 2014 it is important to note the defendant was not charged until 12 May 2015. It is the view of the Court that in such circumstances the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea will be 25% in line with the principles set out in R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.
	


The Facts


	
	The facts in this matter are not in dispute. The defendant and the victim are well known to each other. Their history pre-dates the commission of the offence. To varying degrees the relationship may be described as volatile, a mix of affection muddied by domestic violence. The inference for the latter circumstance is to be drawn from the fact that the defendant was at the time of the commission of the offence subject to restrictions within a Domestic Violence Order that had been brought by Police on behalf of and to protect the victim. The order was made in the Local Court on 3 July 2013 for a period of two years.
	
	
	In particular, condition 1(a) of the Order mandated the defendant “not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the person in need of protection”. Condition (7) prohibited the defendant from “approaching or contacting the protected person by any means whatsoever”.
	
	
	It is a reasonable inference to draw from the facts that the defendant was well aware of the restrictions placed on him in relation to the victim. The facts establish the accused asked the victim to come with him to his house. Unwisely she agreed. When the defendant arrived at his house he entered via the front door; alone. There is a clear inference that he knew he should not be with the victim and that what ensued in the facilitation of the entry of the premises by the victim is a demonstration of an attempt to hide the fact of her being with him. He went to his bedroom, opened the window and assisted the victim to enter the house by that means. Acting contrary to the restrictions imposed on him by the Domestic Violence Orders was a course of conduct undertaken in deliberate defiance not just of those restrictions. The subsequent engagement by the accused in sexual intercourse with the victim was done so in defiance of the fact that he well knew she was of an age where at law any consent to that activity by the victim was nugatory. The defendant well knew what he was doing but proceeded nonetheless.
	
	
	Police attended the premises on an unrelated matter, entered the bedroom finding the defendant to be naked. The victim was located hiding under the bed. Subsequent examination of forensic material confirmed the defendant’s sexual involvement with the victim. It is clear from the agreed facts that the victim was a willing participant in the physical conduct within the offence. That is not to the point. Section 77 of the Crimes Act 1900 makes it clear that consent is not a defence to a charge brought under section 66C.
	
	
	The DPP in these proceedings argues that the victim should be regarded as a vulnerable victim in the sense that the defendant in addition to her age knew of her homelessness and took advantage of her. I take it to mean the Crown relies on section 21A(2)(l) as an aggravating factor. Whilst it can be reasonably inferred in a township such as Bourke that the defendant would know the family circumstances of the victim, the assertion that the offender knowingly took advantage of the victim’s circumstances is an assertion of fact.
	
	
	As such it is to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. This has not been achieved to the satisfaction of the Court. I come to the view it would be unwise to accept an unproven assertion by the Crown on this issue. To do so may lead, in the context of this type of offence, to a degree of double counting.
	
	
	The vulnerability of the victim is nonetheless not in doubt. As consent affords no defence, and this is a case where there is no suggestion of coercion, it can be taken that by the intended manner in which the constitution of this offence is framed, the legislature impliedly asserts the victim is a vulnerable victim. This approach would accord with the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v JDB (2005) 153 A Crim R 164 and R v Boulad [2005] NSWCCA 289 at [21].
	
	
	It is however a fact that the conduct and hence the moral culpability of the offender is aggravated. This arises in two ways. At the time of the commission of the offence the offender was on bail for serious offences of violence. In addition he was subject to the specific restrictions imposed on him in relation to his conduct towards the victim by reason of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order.
	
	
	Courts have consistently reaffirmed that committing offences whilst on conditional liberty aggravates the offence. This approach is confirmed in s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is similarly the case where the offence is committed against the protected person in relation to a current Apprehended Domestic Violence Order: see the observations of the Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v R (2008) 181 A Crim R 185 at [8] and R v Macadam-Kellie [2001] NSWCCA 170 at [37]-[38]. As was observed at [38] in the latter case this is an aggravating factor of particular relevance to general deterrence.
	
	
	I have already noted the furtive nature of the defendant’s conduct to introduce the victim into his premises without being observed as raising the inescapable conclusion that he knew what he was doing was in breach of the order. The existence of Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders is a policy approach that endeavours to protect the person found to be in need of protection. In this instance enforceable orders were made to protect a 14 year old girl [as she was when the order was made; 15 at the time of the offence] from this defendant. In full knowledge that what he intended to do the defendant accompanied the victim from his auntie’s premises to his own with the clear inference that he intended to have unlawful sexual intercourse with her. As indicated, it matters not that she was willing to engage in the activity. Consent from an immature, vulnerable young woman is in reality no consent at all. A reality confirmed by the intention of the legislature to remove consent from consideration for this type of conduct.
	
	
	Objectively the moral culpability of the offender is, in the view of the Court, above the middle range of seriousness. In the circumstances of this offender however and in light of now established authority the level of moral culpability is mitigated by the offender’s background.
	
	
	The offender is a young aboriginal male. At the time of the commission of the offence he was 20 years. Tragically his background is all too familiar to the justice system. He has never known his father. The Court was informed that his father, who is of Fijian/Chinese ethnicity, lives in Fiji. After almost 2 decades of separation from his mother the offender is now residing with her.
	
	
	The detailed report tendered by counsel for the offender and under the hand of Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Furst describes a “chaotic and dysfunctional family life, being raised by foster parents since he was 3 years of age”. Dr Furst states at pages 6-7 of his report that the offender’s life experience “derives from an unstable family and community background marred by alcohol abuse, drug abuse and violence. His self-esteem has been adversely affected by the absence of a positive father figure, feelings of rejection and general emotional volatility”. Dr Furst goes on to state that the offender:
	


… meets criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD, characterised by inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity and restlessness with chronic problems with alcohol and drug abuse/ dependence, especially involving alcohol abuse over recent years, chronic cannabis dependence and the regular use of ‘ice’.

He has generally poor coping skills, also indicative of an unstable personality structure, decompensating under stress and becoming depressed and or suicidal. His reported depressive symptoms are consistent with chronic dysthymia and more recent features of an adjustment disorder with depressed mood following his relationship breakup and incarceration earlier this year.

In my opinion his offending behaviour was part of a general pattern of immaturity, disregard for normal legal and moral standards and generally poor decisions…. There was insufficient evidence to warrant the diagnosis of a major mental illness….


	
	During his period in custody on remand the mental health of the offender was assessed by a Court Liaison officer. As was the case with the report of Doctor Furst, the disadvantaged upbringing of the offender, his alcohol and drug dependencies and suicidal ideation were highlighted. So far as the latter is concerned the offender’s history identifies three attempts at self-harm, one through an overdose of his mother’s prescription medication and two unsuccessful attempts at hanging himself.
	
	
	The Drug and Alcohol history in the Justice Health report is yet another part of the chain of disadvantage which brings the Court to the relevant legal considerations so far as the offender’s background and medical history is concerned and their combined impact on the moral culpability of the offender for his conduct.
	
	
	It is a trite observation to make that the offender suffers from the consequences of a multi layered environment of social disadvantage. It can be inferred from the report of the Senior Health Clinician Laura Nilon attached to the Joint Investigation Response Team that so too has the victim. I refer to the victim at this point because before turning to the impact of settled law in relation to the defendant it is important to acknowledge her position in the context of one of the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The process is not all about the defendant and the consequences of his passage through life.
	
	
	The various reports and documents establish that the emotional commitment to the relationship by the defendant was ephemeral. He has since moved on to relationships with other, significantly more mature women. It is highly likely that as the victim ages and matures she will suffer disenchantment at the thought of giving herself to the blandishments of the offender only to be discarded. Whilst no victim impact statement has been forthcoming life experience informs that she will feel used and not valued by the defendant. That is no legacy to leave a young woman approaching adulthood, particularly one whose own life was, and likely remains, an emotional roller coaster layered with a problematic future. The defendant said to Dr Furst that he now regrets what took place. That may be the case but contrition is no antidote to the disappointment of the victim.
	
	
	The starting point for the assessment of the impact of social disadvantage on offenders is to be found in the seminal decision of R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58.  That decision is added to by the High Court decisions in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37, Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38 and others. I do not intend to recite at length the principles set out in the various decisions but to identify those that are of particular importance in these proceedings.
	
	
	The decision in Munda re-emphasises the fact that our system of justice is to be applied from the perspective of equality before the law. As was said at [53] of that judgment:
	


Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight but they must not be allowed to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. It would be contrary to the principles stated in Neal [(1982) 149 CLR 305] to accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed systemically as less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities.


	
	Against that background however is the observation of the Court in Bugmy at [40]:
	


… The circumstances that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.


	
	There can be no argument that this defendant falls within the context of such an upbringing. Accordingly the Court finds that the level of moral culpability attaching to the defendant’s behaviour is mitigated by the unfortunate circumstances of his upbringing. In light of Dr Furst’s observations regarding the defendant’s development outlined earlier I take note of the observations made by the Court in BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [5]:
	


… that emotional maturity and impulse control develops progressively during adolescence and early adulthood and may not be fully developed until the early to mid-20s. Youth may be a material factor in sentencing even a 19 year old for the most serious offence.

This brings the Court to the issue of rehabilitation and an issue within submissions wherein the DPP and the Defendant through his counsel are at odds.


	
	During the course of submissions on sentence the Court’s attention was drawn to the issue of rehabilitation in the context of the likelihood of ongoing sexual offending. It would appear that this issue arises as a result of comments contained within the Pre-Sentence report from Probation and Parole. That report expresses views on the risk of reoffending. They appear to have been based on a case file assessment of static risk factors. The report acknowledges at page 2 under the heading “Sex Offending” that its opinion requires further testing. As the report stands it assesses the defendant as a medium risk of re-offending. The Court infers this risk relates to re-offending by committing further sexual offences.
	
	
	Dr Furst at page 5 of his report expressly contradicts the opinion in the Pre-Sentence report. He expresses the opinion the defendant presents “a low risk of future sexual offending”. The decision Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213 provided to the Court for its assistance on this issue acknowledges at [40]-[45] to the caution that ought to be exercised in relation to reliance on the Static 99R assessment. Given the short period of consideration by the Probation Officer and the focus by Dr Furst on this from his position of greater expertise, his opinion together with the lack of any further instances of this type of behaviour in the last 18 months, the risk of reoffending is, in the opinion of the Court, relatively low, a conclusion which assists the Court in assessing the prospects of rehabilitation for a young offender.
	
	
	Although the foregoing factors are of particular relevance in these proceedings and the Court recognizes that the factors described operate to mitigate the penalty in this matter the nature of the defendant’s conduct remains serious.
	
	
	In the course of submissions the DPP referred the Court to Remarks on Sentence of the Local Court in DPP v Sheldon [2009] NSWLC 17. By accident rather than design, the remarks are my remarks delivered in a matter prosecuted under the same Section of the Crimes Act as the matter before me today. The factual matrix in the earlier proceedings is very different from that before me at this time and it is of course not the remarks upon which the DPP rely, but the authorities expressed within the remarks. In particular the observations of the Court in R v Zappala (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 5 November 1991, unrep) wherein the Court said:
	


One begins with the proposition that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged by the legislature in providing for greater penalties when the victim is under 16… That acknowledgment has been our legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life caused by such conduct.

The law has always sought to protect young children against sexual predators particularly adult men.


	
	The background to the decision in Zappala may be significantly different than in this case but the social and policy considerations remain. General and particular deterrence are of great importance in sentencing for this type of offence; so too is rehabilitation given the age of the offender.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant drew the Court’s attention to sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission in support of his contention that imprisonment is not necessarily a given outcome for this type of offence. That of course is a fact. Observations on the utility of statistics are well settled. They are a guide as to encourage consistency in the sentencing range not a substitute for the exercise of judicial discretion.
	
	
	Turning to the appropriate sentence for a matter such as this the Court is required to balance a number of competing considerations. On the one hand is the objective seriousness of the offence, the aggravating factors that effectively represent a defiance of and disregard of the need to respect the law and the guideposts identified in decisions of superior courts that point in favour of deterrent sentences of significance given the impact of such offending on victims. These factors would unquestionably lead the Court to conclude that the threshold set out in s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has been crossed such as to warrant imposition of a full time sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	Subjectively the early plea of guilty, youth of the offender, pre-existing and ongoing social disadvantage and ongoing issues in relation to his mental health which pre and postdate the commission of the offence operate to mitigate the penalty. It is the view of the Court however that they do not mitigate the penalty to the extent that imprisonment is no longer appropriate.
	
	
	It remains the Court’s view that the circumstances of the offence and of aggravation outweigh those in mitigation to the point where a sentence of imprisonment remains the appropriate outcome. After application of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea the length of the sentence of imprisonment is one of 15 months. Having determined the length of the sentence and in line with the decision in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 I turn to the manner in which such sentence should be served. It is here in my view that the Court should pause and look again at the offender.
	
	
	The offender has already spent 43 days in custody on remand. I have no doubt in relation to the salutary effect this period of deprivation of liberty has had on him. The defendant has also re-established himself with his mother and now resides with her. It is hoped that this change in domestic circumstances will contribute to the void created by his separation from her for almost 20 years. The defendant has ongoing psychological and psychiatric issues that will endure long beyond the period of incarceration identified by the Court thus far. He is young both in age and maturity. It is important from these considerations to endeavour to create an outcome that addresses matters that contribute to causation but to do so in a way that neither undermines the objective of general deterrence whilst at the same time does not crush the prospect of rehabilitation. On the documentation presented to this Court and referred to variously thus far the defendant is at a cross road in his life.
	
	
	Rehabilitation would represent the optimal outcome for the community and for the offender. Ultimately that is his responsibility however the State also has an obligation to assist when it can and when it is appropriate. In addressing this aspect I note the remarks of Yehia DCJ in R v Brett Sharpley [2014] NSWDC 166 and adopt her Honour’s observations wherein she quoted (at [70]) from the decision in Yardley v Bates (1979) 22 SASR 108:
	


The protection of the community is also contributed to by successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits.

If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists in order to avoid offending in the future, the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced.

And further (at [71]), R v Lattouf (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1996, unrep):

It is in my opinion necessary that the law allow to a sentencing judge a discretion to determine the sentence appropriate for the particular offence, for the particular offender, and for the circumstances of the particular case. … General principles must, of their nature, be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. …

… To see the sentencing process as involving no more than stern punishment for each offender is not merely simplistic; it damages the public interest. A sentencing process which is seen by the public merely as draconian and not just will lose the support of those whom it is designed to protect. If a sentencing process does not achieve justice, it should be put aside. … [I]f justice is not individual, it is nothing…

But, in addition, a sentencing process must be capable of discriminating between cases. There is, as I have said, a public interest in punishment. But if the desire to punish results in a person who would otherwise not become a confirmed criminal becoming such, that sentencing process is inconsistent with the public interest.

It is to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person who will not be a persistent criminal into one who is.


	
	It is the understanding of the Court the offender is not eligible for an alternate sentence of imprisonment in the form of Home Detention or an Intensive Correction Order, each of which would have effectively addressed the issue of denunciation whilst affording an opportunity to address some of the issues of causation that would not be addressed as an incarcerated prisoner because of the lack of sufficient length in the sentence to enable engagement with in custody programmes.   
	
	
	The alternative, and one which addresses the issues of denunciation and deterrence but will enable the opportunity for engagement in the rehabilitative process at an early date is a sentence of imprisonment that is wholly suspended and subject to conditions intended to manage the offender within the community to the extent that his changed family arrangements and identification of his serious psychological and related conditions capable of treatment in a therapeutic sense can be addressed. The Court’s confidence in taking this course is enlivened by the fact that so far as the Court is aware, the defendant did not re-offend whilst on good behaviour bonds imposed in respect of other offending in a short period of time during the latter part of 2013 and early 2014.
	
	
	I re-emphasise to the defendant that he is at a cross road in his life. He will be given significant assistance and guidance to address some of the problems that contribute to causation in the sense of criminal offending behaviour. Ultimately however it is he who is accountable to the community for what he does.
	
	
	I make it abundantly clear to the defendant that this outcome is not a soft option. The law in relation to breaches of suspended sentences is well settled. Any further offending during the currency of the bond will see the defendant sent to gaol.
	
	
	The Orders of the Court are as follows:
	



	
	The defendant is convicted.
	
	
	The conviction is to be recorded as a conviction for a domestic violence offence.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 15 months.
	
	
	The sentence is suspended pursuant to section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 upon condition the defendant enter a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 15 months and to appear before the Court if called upon to do so. The bond is conditioned that the defendant –
	



	
	Be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months   
	
	
	Accept the supervision and direction of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of that service as to participation in such rehabilitation programmes considered appropriate by the service. In particular consideration is to be given to involvement by the defendant in Anger Management programmes, Drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, including residential programs if appropriate
	
	
	Engage with the Aboriginal Medical Service and accept treatment as determined by a medical practitioner of that service.

2702720,R v Osman Chamseddine [2015] NSWDC 233,"Judgment

CHARGES


	
	On 28 May 2015, Osman Chamseddine (“the offender”) was convicted by a jury following a trial at Parramatta on four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, and two charges of aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years. Those counts are set out as follows:
	


“(1) Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender had sexual intercourse with MP, a child then of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 10 or 11 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely she was under the authority of Osman Chamseddine.”

(2)   “Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender assaulted MP and at the time of the assault, committed an act of indecency on MP, a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 10 or 11 years.”

(3)   “Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender had sexual intercourse with MP, a child then of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 10 or 11 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely she was under the authority of Osman Chamseddine.”

(4)   “Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender had sexual intercourse with MP, a child then of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 10 or 11 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely she was under the authority of Osman Chamseddine.”

(5)   “Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender had sexual intercourse with MP, a child then of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 10 or 11 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely she was under the authority of Osman Chamseddine.”

(6)   “Between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009, the offender assaulted MP and at the time of the assault, committed an act of indecency on MP, a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 10 or 11 years.”


	
	Counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 are brought pursuant to section 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (“Crimes Act”). The maximum penalty for each offence under this section, separately, is 20 years. There is no standard non-parole period for these offences.
	
	
	Counts 2 and 6 are brought pursuant to section 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for each offence under this section, separately, is 10 years. There is a prescribed standard non-parole period of 8 years for each offence separately.
	


Facts


	
	The evidence given at the trial which is consistent with the jury’s verdict and which I find to be the case is as follows:
	
	
	The complainant, MP (“Ms MP”), was born in August 1998, meaning that she was between the ages of 10 and 11, and in 4th grade, at the time of the relevant incidents in 2009.
	
	
	Ms MP is and was, at the time of the offences, both deaf and with limited vocal abilities. The trial was conducted with an Auslan interpreter signing Ms MP’s evidence with verification by a signing translator also in attendance.
	
	
	Ms MP lived at home with her parents, in the outer western suburbs of Sydney, at the time of the offences. It was the custom for her to be collected first by the offender and then for a route to be followed (which was set out in exhibits before the jury) to school and then the reverse route followed back to her home from school.
	
	
	She was the first child to be collected on the way to school and the last child to be dropped off on the return route. The normal time for her to be returned back to her home was about 3:30pm. That evidence become relevant in terms of the opportunity that the offender had to deviate from the route followed, such that she was not in the company of any other students when the offender took her to an isolated industrial area in Lyn Parade. A police drive-through of the relevant route followed. The area where Ms MP indicated the events had taken place was played before the jury via a video recording.
	
	
	The offender was a taxi driver, employed by a contractor, Mr Abdul Wahab Kassem, who, in turn, had the contract with the Department of Education to provide transport services for children with disabilities to and from their homes to the local school. At the relevant time the offender was aged about 60.
	


Identification


	
	The offender was not Ms MP’s normal driver. It appeared that he had taken over the driving for a short period of time prior to the date of the assaults. Ms MP gave identification evidence of him as being a person of Middle Eastern/Iranian appearance and around 50 years old (at the time of the offence) (Child Interview Transcript 5.12.13 Q/A 42). Further, she identified him in a photographic array of 20 people (Exhibit 6). A video of her selection of the offender was played before the jury. It was not an issue throughout the trial that he was the driver at the relevant time, given the run sheets produced by the taxi company.
	
	
	Ms MP’s mother gave evidence that during the relevant periods covered by the payment schedule records (exhibit 11) when the offender was employed by RSL cabs that the person “Osman” was the only driver who picked up and dropped off Ms MP.
	


Incidents


	
	Each of the events constituting counts 1 to 6 involved the offender diverting from the regular route to Ms MP’s home and stopping the car in Lyn Parade, a short distance from the street where Ms MP was living at the time. All the offences took place in the taxi on the route back from school. Ms MP was the only passenger in the car at those times. The offences occurred between a range of dates, sometime between June and November 2009. It was clear from Ms MP’s evidence (T 30 lines 15 to 19) and accepted by the jury that the offences occurred over at least 4 discrete occasions within a 3 week period, namely one incident in the first week, then twice in the second week, then once in the third week (Child Interview 5.12.13 Q/A 26 and 27).
	
	
	Ms MP stated in her interview with police (5 December 2013 Q/A 76), which became Exhibit 2, that when the offender touched her, her body “…was frozen” from fear; that she could not say stop, and that she “didn’t know how to say don’t touch me”. She further stated in that interview (Q/A 29) that she tried but could not get out of the taxi on those occasions, as she was too young to know where to go. She also said that the offender told her not to tell her parents or her teacher, and that she said “ok” because she was frightened (Q/A 121). Her evidence was that she understood what the offender said to her because of her ability to lip-read.
	
	
	Count 1:
	


a.   The first count involved the offender driving to an area of Lyn Parade. He stopped the car, reached across and under her skirt, and touched her underneath her underpants, on and inside her vagina. Ms MP gave evidence with the aid of diagrams about the extent of the digital penetration being beyond and within the lips of the labia (“on the outside inside the lips”). She also gave this evidence with respect to the other counts.

b.   Ms MP stated in her police interview (Q/A 79) that he touched her quickly at least on this occasion.


	
	Count 2:
	


a.   The second count occurred when she was seated in the back of the taxi van (T 33 line 37). This offence occurred on the same occasion as either of counts 4 or 5, as Ms MP stated it happened on the third or fourth occasion (T 33 line 23).

b.   Ms MP described the offender as getting out and into the rear of the van closing the door. He then manipulated her hand onto his groin and crotch area. Ms MP described his penis under his clothing as being hard (Child Interview Transcript Q/A 155). She further stated (Q/A 104) that the offender on this occasion lay down on the chair at the back of the taxi. She said that she was trying to scream to get people’s attention, but they could not hear her.

c.   Ms MP said that the offender stopped because she told him that she had to go home at the right time, and that as a result of this, he got angry with her.


	
	Count 3:
	


a.   This count also involved the offender inserting his finger in Ms MP’s vagina.


	
	Count 4:
	


a.   The acts constituting this count again involved insertion of the offender’s finger into Ms MP’s vagina. She said “… it hurt, I couldn’t stop him”. She was frightened of him.


	
	Count 5:
	


a.   On this occasion, Ms MP described the offender as trying to pull her legs apart (Child Interview Transcript 5.12.13 Q/A 85). She tried to stop him but he was too strong. She said that she was scared and said “Stop, you can’t, you can’t try to touch me all the time” and that she was nervous (Q/A 99).

b.   She also stated that she could feel the offender’s finger moving in her vagina, and that it “really hurt” (Child Interview Transcript 5.12.13 Q/A 100), and at one stage, she indicated that it hurt, by saying “Ow” (Q/A 103).


	
	Count 6:
	


a.   This count involved the offender touching Ms MP’s breast outside her clothes. Ms MP said that this offence occurred on the second occasion (T 33 line 46).

b.   Ms MP said in the police interview (Child interview Transcript 5.12.13 Q/A 95) that whilst she was seated to the left of the offender, he used one hand to touch her right breast over her shirt, whilst simultaneously using his other hand to touch her vagina (which constituted count 5). She states (Q/A 97) that she was holding onto her shirt to try to protect herself, as the offender was “trying to get in there” (Q/A 99), meaning inside her shirt.

Complaint evidence


	
	The complaint’s evidence relied on by the Crown was that of Ms MP’s comments to a fellow student with whom she was close. That student was Mr DAS (“Mr DAS”) who gave evidence by sign language in the form of a recorded interview, and also at trial by way of audio-visual link. His evidence was also certified.
	
	
	There was a program conducted at the school they both attended on what was referred to as a White Ribbon Day, an initiative to raise awareness of issues of violence, particularly against women. On the following day, the teacher, HM (""Ms HM""), discussed with a classroom of girls the different forms of abuse, including emotional and sexual abuse, and that everyone has a right not to be abused. Ms HM said (T 76) that after this discussion, the boys came back into the classroom, then while she went to the storeroom, Ms MP and Mr DAS approached her.
	
	
	Mr DAS’s evidence was that Ms MP had told him at school that she had been touched inappropriately, and following that discussion, Mr DAS said to Ms MP that she ought to raise her allegations with the teacher, Ms HM. Ms HM said that when Ms MP and Mr DAS approached her, Mr DAS prompted Ms MP, who told Ms HM that she had been taken to a place by a taxi driver when she was in primary school, and there, he had touched Ms MP inappropriately. Ms MP confirmed that this taxi driver was not the same taxi driver as the one who was currently driving her to and from high school (T 79). Ms MP then told Ms HM (T 80) that she agreed to Ms HM informing WW (""Ms WW""), the then head teacher of the support unit at RTHS (""the school"") but did not want her mum to be told because she did not want her to be upset.
	
	
	Thereafter Ms MP was interviewed by officers of the child sexual assault unit, in particular by Detective Potts, on about 5 December 2013. Events proceeded from there.
	
	
	Ms MP’s evidence was that she did not tell her parents earlier after the incidents because she was “frozen in fear” and she was frightened to tell her mother and father, as the offender had directed her not to.
	
	
	The complaint evidence both to Mr DAS as well as to the teacher, Ms HM, and the police were essentially consistent with each other.
	


Issues at trial


	
	The substantial issues at trial were: 
	


a.   whether the offender was the person who committed the acts as described by Ms MP; and

b.   whether those acts occurred;

c.   what routes were followed by the offender from her school to home and, in particular, whether there was a deviation to the area in or near Lyn Parade.

Comments on evidence at trial


	
	It is appropriate that the following matters are noted. The jury were given written outlines of the elements and also had the transcript of the evidence. The directions given to them are set out in the transcript. They deliberated in excess of 3 ½ days before returning their verdict.
	
	
	Ms MP’s evidence was given clearly and concisely within the parameters and limitations of the Auslan/signing interpreter evidence. Ms MP’s evidence was recorded. It was my observation that she did not make any attempt to exaggerate what she said had occurred nor to feign any emotional over-reaction. A DVD was played of a ‘walk’/drive-through conducted by the police with Ms MP and Auslan interpreters on the route followed by the offender with her on the way to and from school (Exhibit 9).
	
	
	In particular, her evidence as to the crucial aspect of where she went in the relatively isolated area of Lyn Parade involved a direct and immediate identification of where the acts were said to have taken place.
	
	
	In terms of the crucial issue of identification, there were two photographic line-up arrays conducted. One involved Ms MP, and another involved her mother, EP (""Ms EP""). DVDs of the two procedures were played (Exhibits 6 and 14 respectively), and printouts of the photo array were tendered (Exhibits 7 and 15 respectively). Ms MP identified the offender further from the array containing the other person who may have driven her from time to time. Mr Kassem, the other driver at the relevant time, was not identified as the person who assaulted her.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence and denied that he had ever taken Ms MP to Lyn Parade, and that he had never touched her inappropriately as she had suggested.
	
	
	There was some lack of precision as to exactly which months the events occurred leading to the range of dates on the particulars under the indictment. However, in the circumstances of the indictment and the age periods specified in that section, that is of minor significance for these purposes.
	


Evidence on sentencing proceedings

Victim Impact Statement


	
	Ms MP provided a victim impact statement, which she read to the court on sentence. It included reference to her fear when the events were happening, in particular, that “she was scared of the guy, scared he would do it again each time I saw him driving the bus”.
	
	
	Ms MP felt depressed and upset; she was frightened, especially of drivers, and stressed. She continues to feel distrustful of men and does not like to be around men other than her father.
	
	
	The incidents have had a continuing impact on her. She said that “I felt like he changed my life. It’s changed me”.
	
	
	My observation of her from the trial was that she was an intelligent, thoughtful young woman who was clearly following the proceedings on the questions put to her. The effect on her is clearly long-lasting and complex, as evidenced not only from her Victim Impact Statement, but her demeanour throughout the trial and sentence proceedings.
	
	
	It is important that the sentence recognises the harm done to the victim, Ms MP, the extent of which may only fully come to light in her later years. In SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255, it was said that sexual abuse of children of very tender years will inevitably give rise to psychological damage emanating from (at least) the confusion in the young mind of the victim of abuse. Unlike in that case, where the victim was then aged 6, I do not consider Ms MP to have then been in her tender years. However, she was undoubtedly in her years of pre-adolescence, and in those circumstances, the full extent of the harm that this offence has caused may not be fully appreciated until she gets older.
	


Harm to victim


	
	Defence counsel also relies on EG v R [2015] NSWCCA 21 at [28] – [31], as to the Victim Impact Statement and the Crown submission that the harm suffered is greater than could normally be established.
	
	
	This is difficult to assess in those circumstances. Clearly the harm is not insignificant. She has been clearly affected but, essentially due to the support she has received from various sources, she has reached a situation where she has emerged with the attitudes she now has, and is quietly confident given the circumstances. I do not find it has been an aggravated feature in those circumstances.
	
	
	However, in all such cases, the hurt and other impacts must be looked at in the context of the particular victim.
	


Evidence of the offender


	
	The offender did not give evidence on the sentencing proceedings. He gave evidence at the trial, as did the character witnesses called on his behalf.
	
	
	The offender is a 65 year old man of Lebanese origin. He immigrated to Australia in 1981 and has remained here since.
	
	
	Prior to his incarceration, he lived with his family in the western suburbs of Sydney. He has 4 children, all of whom are adults.
	
	
	Importantly, he has no prior convictions of any kind.
	


Psychologist’s Report


	
	A report has been tendered from Chris Probets dated 5 August 2015.
	
	
	It provides that the offender had a difficult childhood in Lebanon, as his family was very poor and his parents separated when he was six years old. The offender stated that he lived for a period with his grandfather in a very poor slum area, but moved back in with his father at age 14.
	
	
	At best, the offender’s early education can be described as tumultuous. He was taken in and out of school from a young age, so that he could work, to alleviate the poor financial situation of his family. He had completed year 4 and attained only basic Arabic literacy skills by the time he had been taken out of school. He then resumed school at 14, after his father had taken him back. After 2 years, he was again taken out of school and spent several years doing unskilled heavy timber work, and his duties were restricted to labouring and cleaning. He later left that job and commenced work at a textile retail shop, where he worked for about four years.
	
	
	The offender also reported a medical history including back pain, which appears to have been caused by heavy labour. A motor vehicle accident has left him with neck and shoulder problems. He also has kidney problems, high blood pressure, and gout and an enlarged prostate gland. The report states that he is taking medication for each of these issues and was consulting two specialists for his kidney problem prior to his incarceration.
	
	
	The psychologist assessed the offender as having a low mood, indicative of moderate depression, as he was finding his situation difficult. The psychologist, Mr Probets, also stated that the offender was particularly upset for his family as they relied on him to do all of the driving.
	


Assessment of risk of re-offending


	
	He was assessed as being in the low risk category of re-offending, his score being 1 – in a scale of zero to 10. This is corroborated by the psychologist’s finding that he presents an extremely low risk of reoffending, due to his personality, demeanour, attitudes and his current marital status and family commitments.
	
	
	The psychologist, Mr Probets, reported that being pushed out of home by both his father and his grandfather, and the subsequent feelings of rejection by his family, appears to have had a strong adverse impact on him. He stated however, that these feelings of rejection were, up until the time of his incarceration, being realised by his care for his family, including spending time with his children and grandchildren, and other young people associated with the family.
	
	
	Mr Probets recommended that the offender undertake treatment for coping with his current situation, and resolving anxiety and depression which appear to have developed as a result of his conviction. He reported that it would probably not be useful (and in any event, would likely not be allowed) to undertake specific sex offender treatment as he is pleading his innocence and therefore is not showing any remorse.
	
	
	Further, his opinion was that the offender does not require psychological treatment in order to reduce the risk of him re-offending as he, Mr Probets, did not find any symptoms, attitudes, or behaviour that could indicate any such risk of re-offending, and therefore there was no disorder or other risk factor to treat.
	
	
	He recommended instead, that the offender could participate in the CORE program that operates for low risk offenders. This is a low-risk version of the CUBIT program. However, it was conceded that the offender would need to admit his guilt in order to participate in this program. Mr Probets suggested instead that in the absence of any acceptance by the offender of his guilt, he could also participate in the Deniers Program.
	


Pre-Sentence Report


	
	A report has been tendered from Mr Mahmoud Elsayed and dated 13 July 2015. Many aspects of this report are in line with the psychologist’s report as outlined above.
	
	
	The report writer had been in contact with the offender’s wife, who confirmed that their relationship was stable and supportive, and free of domestic violence and drug and alcohol issues. The offender’s wife described him as being a religious man incapable of such offending behaviour, and confirmed that he has the support of his children.
	
	
	The report states that after the offender’s arrival in Australia in 1981, he continued to work as a labourer. However, stable employment was difficult for him as he had very limited English and, as a result, the longest period of continuous employment was for five months, during the period that he was working for the Assisted School Travel Program in 2009.
	
	
	At the time of his incarceration, the offender was in receipt of the Aged Disability Support Pension.
	
	
	The report writer also described the offender as being cooperative, though presenting a low mood, and having described the conviction as ‘wrong’ and denying the offence generally.
	
	
	Further, the offender told the report writer that had he engaged in the sexual activity that took place, this would have led to sexual penetration or ejaculation.
	
	
	The report also referred to an assessment conducted by a psychologist from Forensic Psychology Services dated 1 July 2015 that confirmed that the offender is within the low risk category as compared with other male sexual offenders, and that as a result of this level of risk, he would not be considered a priority for specialised treatment within the sex offenders’ programmes.
	
	
	That assessment also provided that in any event, given the offender’s language limitations, he would likely find it difficult to participate in or profit from such treatment programmes. The assessment recommended that the offender might benefit from a comprehensive assessment once sentence proceedings are finalised, in order to identify whether there is any evidence of sexual or psychological dysfunction that need to be addressed within the term of the sentence.
	
	
	Given the low level of risk, the Pre-Sentence Report writer stated that the offender is unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections. However, if a period of supervision is ordered, case management strategies would need to include a referral to psychological services and monitoring stability.
	
	
	Further, the offender was assessed as being unsuitable for a Community Service Order due to his physical health concerns as outlined above.
	


Character evidence


	
	Evidence was given as part of the accused’s evidence during of the trial from four testimonial/character witnesses, namely from his family and in-laws.
	
	
	The four character witnesses were all relatively young women who indicated either that they had been looked after by him during their early years, or had had their children looked after by him, without any kind of incident or approach whatsoever. Further, the combined effect of their evidence was that they would all trust the offender to look after their children.
	
	
	Ms Joanne Chaaban gave evidence (T 216 to 218). Ms Chaaban is the offender’s nephew’s daughter, and had spent extensive time alone in the offender’s care from the age of 4 through to 15 or 16. She said that the offender would drive her to and from school, shops, and her friends’ homes. She described him as a respectful and quiet man who does not like drama.
	
	
	Ms Janana Chadric gave evidence (T 219 to 221). Ms Chadric is the offender’s daughter-in-law, and met the offender when she was about 15 years old. She said she had spent a lot of time with him and his family, and described the offender as a gentle, kind, caring and loving man. She said that he was good with the grandchildren, and that he cooked, cleaned and did all of the work around the home. She had never seen him act inappropriately around people, particularly children.
	
	
	Ms Jiji Salah gave evidence (T 222 to 225). Ms Salah is the offender’s niece. She gave evidence that when she was younger, from around the ages of 5 to 14, she would spend considerable time with the offender, and she and her siblings would stay the night at his home while her father would work late. She too described the offender as a goodhearted man, who had never acted inappropriately or in a way which made her feel uncomfortable.
	
	
	Ms Careva Tomic also gave evidence (T 226 to 229). Ms Tomic is another of the offender’s daughters-in-law, and had known the offender for fifteen years. She said that she had lived with the offender’s family from the age of 17 to 22 and, since having children, had the offender collect her daughter from day care regularly. She described him as a quiet, humble and kind man, who had never acted inappropriately with her daughter or herself.
	
	
	The Crown case, with respect to those character references, was that each of the witnesses was related to the offender, either by blood or marriage. Further, that the offender and each of the witnesses’ families were part of the Lebanese community, and that they were part of a close-knit extended family, therefore drawing comparison to the relationship between the offender and the victim, who was not Lebanese nor a familial relation.
	
	
	This evidence is relied on as character evidence. It is also summarised in exhibit S4.
	
	
	Further references were tendered on sentencing proceedings. Firstly, by Mr Salah Mansour (exhibit S 8), who is the offender’s brother-in-law. He has known the offender for over 30 years, and has always found the offender to be a trustworthy, decent and reliable man. He, like the other witnesses who gave evidence during the trial, said that the offender was willing to help people.
	
	
	A reference was also tendered by Mr Shawky Salah, who is also the offender’s brother-in-law. Mr Salah also said that he has known the offender to be a decent, reliable and trustworthy person, and that the offences are in contrast to his reputation as such. He said that he would still continue to be around his family and friends.
	


Prior good character


	
	The issue of the prior good character of the offender requires consideration of s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides:
	


“(5A) In determining the appropriate sentence for a child sexual offence, the good character or lack of previous convictions of an offender is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence.”


	
	Here, in my view, the applicant’s lack of prior convictions was not a mitigating factor on the basis that “his good character was a factor which was of assistance to him in the commission of these offences”.
	
	
	That is because he would not have been employed to be the driver of these children if he had a prior conviction of any kind involving children, as each driver is required to clear a ‘working with children’ check with the Department of Transport (T 91 and 92).
	
	
	As was said in O’Brien v R [2013] NSWCCA 197 per Adamson J, a case involving the sexual abuse of a girl by an offender who had befriended her family, the offender’s good character was not used favourably towards the offender, as he had “used his good character to gain access to the victim and to gain her trust”. The offender in this case was not a friend of the family. However, he had obtained the trust of her parents and Ms MP’s school through his capacity as a taxi / bus driver for the students.
	


Remorse / contrition


	
	The offender continues to deny his involvement in any of the activities as detailed by Ms MP.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report stated that when the offender was discussing the offences, the offender accepted that he would take a different route home as he was not familiar with the area. He further reported that the victim, Ms MP, was free to sit anywhere in the van, and was not forced to sit near the offender.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report also stated that the offender maintained his innocence. Despite this position, the psychologist reported that the offender was fully aware of the seriousness of the offences.
	


Consideration


	
	Here, what was involved was a series of assaults which took place on a hearing and speech impaired young girl who was between the ages of 10 and 11, by an older man who was in a position of trust, in that Ms MP was under his direct care and supervision.
	
	
	The whole purpose of the provision of publicly subsidised and supervised transport with an assessed contractor was and is to ensure that disadvantaged children in the position of this young and vulnerable girl could be guaranteed safe and responsible conduct from the time she left her parents’ home on the way to and from school.
	
	
	Ms MP’s evidence was that when the offender became the “new driver” she was nervous about having a new driver (Child Interview Transcript 5.12.13 Q/A 19). What was also important in this regard was the fact that the acts occurred in isolated areas. The offender selected and controlled the route which was followed. He was an experienced driver who presumably would have known there were few people passing by who could either observe what was happening or could have been called upon to help in the unlikely event that the young girl with this disability was able to make known her protestations about what was going on. Ms MP at the time was a girl of average build, of about 4’ 6” in height. The offender was an older man of about 5’ 8” and of average build.
	
	
	In relation to the various counts, depending on which count is concerned, he either reached across the seat or got into the rear of the taxi van. There was nothing the young girl could do. Her disability imposed limitations on her ability to scream for help or to attract the attention of passers-by. In any event, it was unlikely that she could have attracted that attention given the locale of the offences, that is, the relatively isolated area which the offender had selected and to which he had driven her.
	
	
	While the level of penetration appears to be relatively slight, the criminality must be considered in the light of all the other evidence, including Ms MP’s age, her particular circumstances, which were self-evident to the offender, and factors such as the length of the trips involved.
	
	
	The departure by the offender from the established route to and from school to the home of Ms MP was clearly intended to provide him with the opportunity on the separate occasions on which these events occurred to indulge in the activities pursued.
	
	
	The offences may well have been opportunistic, at least on the first occasion.
	
	
	I have considered the case of RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106 and find that at least from the second occasion, the offences also must have involved a level of premeditation and planning, given that the victim was taken to a remote location.
	


Offences against vulnerable children


	
	The fact that the victim, Ms MP, was young has been taken to be an aggravating factor only in sentencing the offender for counts 1, 3, 4 and 5, as her age was taken to be an aggravating feature and therefore an essential element of the offence in counts 2 and 6.
	
	
	For all of the offences (counts 1 to 6) however, I have taken Ms MP’s special hearing and speaking needs into account as an aggravating factor, particularly as I have accepted that Ms MP’s disadvantages made her more vulnerable in the circumstances. There was no doubt that the offender was aware that Ms MP was not consenting, nor is it relevant to the charge as she is a minor. She was particularly vulnerable in that she was unable at the time of each of the offences to verbalise her protests or attract help in a way that other individuals without those special needs would have been able to do.
	
	
	Carrying out acts of this nature against a child, let alone a child with these self-evident vulnerabilities and disadvantages, can only be described as reprehensible. Any assault, let alone sexual assault and particularly a sexual assault against a child of tender years and with the self-evident vulnerabilities of Ms MP also requires a condign sentence to indicate that there can be no possibility of anybody being in any doubt whatsoever about the heinous acts which took place on the evidence of Ms MP. In this regard, I do not accept defence counsel’s submission that the offences are far from the most serious of their kind (Defence submissions page 2). The offence may not have involved “grooming” as that term is normally interpreted but clearly, that course of action was not necessary where the offender could rely on Ms MP’s constant presence on the bus and, at relevant times, on her own.
	
	
	The evidence which is becoming increasingly available on sentencing proceedings such as this with the constant references in the victim impact statements which are tendered in this and other courts, in addition to the publicly available research material flowing on from the hearings of the Royal Commission on Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, make it clear that offences against children and young children in particular have long-lasting consequences to children’s abilities to trust others.
	
	
	That possibility of impact is only exacerbated when the abuse occurs by persons in position of authority who make it clear and tell their victims not to make disclosures of what appear to be shameful acts, as was the case here.
	
	
	Child victims of sex abuse frequently have to carry around the burden of what has happened to them without disclosing it to anybody or any authority. Their trust of those in authority can often be shattered. Where there has been a breach of the trust, the impact on children of having to keep secrets – here reinforced by the offender’s insistence that she not tell her parents what had happened – may well be more pernicious and long-lasting.
	


Breach of duty / trust


	
	I have taken into account the abuse by the offender of his position of trust as an aggravating factor only for counts 2 and 6: R v Muldoon (unrep, 13/12/90, NSWCCA). It is not to be taken into account for 1, 3, 4, and 5, as it is not an element of that offence.
	
	
	That breach of duty and trust involved not only a basic infringement of the safety which Ms MP was entitled to expect as well as a breach of the duty owed to her parents, her carers, and her teachers, as well as the community. There are four separate classifications of people and institutions who relied on the offender and those employing him to provide an appropriate standard of care, supervision and responsibility. This was manifestly breached for each of the people and institutions concerned.
	
	
	Ms MP’s parents needed to be able to rely on their daughter being safely transported to and from school. The school needed to be able to discharge its duty of care for students with a special needs background to ensure their safety, travelling to and from the school community. Through the Department of Education and its subcontracting transport arrangements, the school needed to be able to ensure that a system of checks were put in place such that persons of good character would be driving the children involved. Given the isolated circumstances in which the offender was with Ms MP, there is little else that could have been done other than to rely on the offender to exercise his position of authority appropriately. He did not do that.
	
	
	All these breaches require a condign sentence to be imposed in relation to the breaches of duty involved in relation only to counts 2 and 6.
	
	
	It is difficult to ascertain what enquiries were made by Mr Kassem who was the contractor directly employed by the Department of Education to provide drivers of appropriate competence and character. In any event, in the circumstances that this offender has no prior convictions and was a family man who would have been able to provide character references of the same kind as were provided by his family in court, it was accepted that the offender was considered to be of good character sufficient to be entrusted with the job.
	


Objective criminality


	
	In assessing the objective criminality for each of counts 1 to 6, I find that the offender did exploit the youth and vulnerability of Ms MP. This is a significant matter in determining where each offence lies in the spectrum of offences of that nature: R v Sea (unrep, 13/8/90, NSWCCA) per Badgery-Parker J.
	
	
	It is also the case that, in terms of the position occupied by a given offence on the spectrum of offences of this kind, the younger the child, the more serious the offence: R v T (1990) 47 A Crim R 29. Here, Ms MP was aged 11, that is, she was aged closer to 10 than she was to 16 - in relation to counts 2 and 6, and in relation to counts 1, 3, 4, and 5, she was closer to 10 than she was to 14.
	
	
	It is of considerable significance when assessing the objective seriousness in the indecent assault of a child to consider the actual character of the assault, including the degree of physical contact involved: GAT v R [2007] NSWCCA 208 at [22], the degree of genital connection, the duration of the contact, and age difference between the offender and the victim. Here, there was no threat of force, although the young girl was clearly scared - and scared for a long time.
	
	
	In relation to counts 2 and 6 (indecent assault), I have considered this case against other cases of this nature, including R v Campbell [2005] NSWCCA 125, a case where Hulme J at [31] refers to the offences in that case as being “within the worst category of the range of possible offences for aggravated indecent assaults”. I have also considered R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172, Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146, and GSH v R ; R v GSH [2009] NSWCCA 214. As these cases suggest, it is of considerable significance when assessing the objective seriousness in the indecent assault of a child to consider the actual character of the assault, including the degree of physical contact involved (as set out in GAT v R [2007] NSWCCA 208 at [22]). In each of counts 2 and 6, there was no actual genital connection. However, in count 2, the offender manipulated Ms MP’s hand to touch the offender’s crotch, but over his pants. In count 6, the offender touched Ms MP’s breast outside her clothes.
	
	
	In Corby at [77], it was also held that the age difference between the offender and the victim (in this case about 50 years) can also aggravate the offence.
	
	
	I find that the criminality of counts 2 and 6 are at the lower end of the range of objective criminality essentially because there was no additional violence or terror involved over and above what is inherent in the acts themselves. Further, I find that those acts, while reprehensible, occurred contemporaneously or at about the same time with the other acts constituting the offences under counts 1, 3, 4, and 5.
	
	
	When assessing the objective criminality of counts 1, 3, 4 and 5, I am aware that there is not a clear stance in the authorities as to whether consensual sexual intercourse by digital penetration is generally less serious than an offence of penile penetration. Rather, each case depends on its own facts: R v Hibberd (2009) 194 A Crim R 1 at [56]; R v Da Silva (unrep, 30/11/95, NSWCCA), per Grove J at [3]. I do, with respect, adopt the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 at [36], where it was held:
	


“What is to be considered is the type of penetration in all the circumstances surrounding the offending. The type of penetration is simply one factor and by itself does not indicate how serious the particular offence is… had the intercourse in this case been penile penetration it would have been an offence of very great seriousness if for no other reason than because of the age of the child. In such a case the seriousness of the offence may have been above mid range. But the fact that it was not penile penetration does not mean that the offence is reduced to low range”.


	
	I do accept that distinction, particularly as penile vaginal intercourse carries risks of venereal disease and pregnancy, compared with digital vaginal intercourse. Further, I accept that penile vaginal intercourse generally is a greater affront both physically and mentally, involving a greater intrusion of privacy. However in the circumstances, and given the particular vulnerability of the victim, Ms MP, by reason of her disabilities, I do not consider the offences in counts 1, 3, 4, and 5, to be below mid-range. The offences must be seen against the particular circumstances of the victim, her vulnerability, and the circumstances of those offences.
	
	
	Further, I do not find that the short duration of the offences is a factor that reduces the seriousness of the offending: MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230. Rather, I consider the offences to have been short in duration only because of the time constraints that the offender was under, in dropping the victim off at home from school on time. The relevant time periods of the incident need to be considered in the light of the overall length of the trips where Ms MP had to remain in the taxi bus. However, it is recognised that focusing on a short duration has the capacity to undermine the long term consequences of this sort of conduct.
	
	
	I therefore find that the criminality of counts 1, 3, 4, and 5 are what might be classified as mid-range.
	


Standard non-parole period


	
	My reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period in relation to the aggravated indecent assault offences in a situation where there has been no plea to the relevant charges are that the offender is aged 65 and married and of prior good character. He has limited English. He has also been a person who has been a strong family man, carrying out appropriate child caring and assisting functions for many years.
	
	
	I am unable to find that the offender has shown any remorse or contrition for the offences. Rather, he continues to deny the offences.
	
	
	The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Child Sex Offences) Act 2015 introduced a standard non parole period of 9 years for offences under s 66C(2) in June 2015 for offences after that date. While I emphasise that this has not had any bearing on my findings or sentence to be imposed, I do consider this to be a reflection of the seriousness of such matters. The offender is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the relevant regime at the time.
	


Concurrence, accumulation and totality


	
	I have had regard to the principles of totality as referred to in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] and subsequent decisions, and the necessity of not imposing a crushing sentence, particularly given the offender’s age. A sentence should not connote the destruction of any reasonable expectation of useful life after release: R v Yates (1984) 13 A Crim R 319 at 326; [1985] VR 41 at [48]; R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ, Howie and Whealy JJ) said in R v MAK; R v MSK at [17] that in many cases of multiple offending however, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.
	
	
	Here, the offence involved one victim, but she was assaulted on four separate occasions over a three week period (T 30 lines 15 to 19) in 2009. The sentence needs to reflect the total criminality of the offences.
	
	
	The criminality in the four sexual intercourse matters (counts 1, 3, 4, 5) is substantially the same.
	
	
	The criminality involved in the two indecent assault matters (counts 2 and 6) is somewhat different and accordingly, that is reflected in the different sentences for those offences. However, to ensure that a crushing burden is not imposed, particularly given the age of the offender, in my view, the sentences on indecent assault matters should be wholly accumulated with those on the aggravated sexual intercourse matters.
	


General deterrence


	
	As I have set out above, a penalty must be imposed which properly reflects the principles of general deterrence, particularly in circumstances where the victim is vulnerable, by reason of her age and her hearing impairment, and the offender was in a position of trust: R v TAB [2002] NSWCCA 274; R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1.
	
	
	In particular with these types of offences, the sexual abuse of children may give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52], and have long term and serious physical and psychological effects.
	


Personal deterrence


	
	Here, the offender has no prior convictions. He has the support of his family. He continues to deny the offences.
	
	
	He has not shown any remorse or contrition for the offences. Indeed, in that regard, as the Crown has pointed out and I have set out earlier in relation to the Pre-Sentence Report, the offender told the writer that had he engaged in the sexual activity as portrayed by the victim, this would have led to sexual penetration or ejaculation.
	


Hardship to family


	
	The psychologist’s report states that the offender reported that his family were very distressed and upset at what had occurred. All of his family, including his wife and children, do not believe that he could have committed these offences. His wife is having difficulties coping as the offender did many of the household duties including shopping and driving.
	
	
	I refer to the recent case of Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 167 per Davies J, in particular the need to read that consideration consistently with the common law so that it is necessary for the offender to show exceptional hardship to a third party to ameliorate an otherwise appropriate sentence: R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23 at [13] – [17]; R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222; (2013) 235 A Crim R 265 at [93].
	
	
	Here, I do not consider the hardship that will be caused to his family as exceptional or above what would normally be the case in the circumstances. His children are adults who have their own respective families. There is no evidence that his wife would not be able to copy in his absence, albeit with difficulty.
	


Delay


	
	The offences occurred in late 2009, were reported in December 2013, and proceeded to trial in May 2015 – that is some 6 years after the offence took place.
	
	
	In R v Dennis (unrep, 14/12/92, NSWCCA), James J (Hunt CJ at CL and Carruthers J agreeing) said that:
	


“It is not infrequently the case that sexual offences committed against a child of which only the offender and the child have knowledge, are first revealed by the child to a third person only years afterwards when the child has attained a certain level of maturity. In such cases the mere passage of time between the committing of the offences and the disclosure of the offences and the apprehension of the offender is of little weight as a factor in mitigation of penalty.”


	
	The lapse of time between the commission of the offence and notification to police should be a mitigating factor only where the delay would cause unfairness to the offender: R v Johnson (unrep, 16/5/97, NSWCCA) per Priestley JA. In this case, I do not consider there to be any significant disadvantage or detriment to the offender arising from the delay: R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502.
	
	
	Delay will ordinarily be a mitigating factor where it has resulted in significant stress for the offender, or left him or her, to a significant degree, in uncertain suspense: Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38. However I am not aware of whether the offender has suffered anxiety or stress over and above what is normally the case for someone awaiting trial.
	
	
	If the delay is to be relied on by the offender as a mitigating circumstance to consider for his sentence, the detrimental effect of that delay must be established by the offender on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. In the circumstances, I do not find that this is established on the balance of probabilities.
	


Authorities


	
	I have had regard to the comparable sentences as set out in the Public Defenders website. In particular with respect to counts 2 and 6, I have considered GSH v R ; R v GSH [2009] NSWCCA 214 and Wray v R [2014] NSWCCA 166.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the comparable sentences for counts 1, 3, 4 and 5, including NW v R [2011] NSWCCA 178. In that case, the offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced for one count of s 66C(2). There were further matters taken into account on a Form 1, namely, a further s 66C(2) offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14; an offence of producing child pornography; and an offence of aggravated indecent assault. Taking those matters into account, the starting point for the indicative sentence for the s 66C(2) offence was one of eight years imprisonment for an offence involving cunnilingus. That particular is not relevant here.
	
	
	Section 66C(2) of the Crimes Act currently imposes a maximum penalty of 20 years. Prior to 13 June 2003 however, the maximum penalty for an offence under that section was 10 years.
	
	
	It is well established that the increase by the legislature in the maximum penalty, in this case, for conduct proscribed by s 66C(2) must be reflected in the sentences which courts impose: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [52]; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [31].
	


JIRS Statistics


	
	I have been referred to and had regard to the JIRS statistics. The sentencing statistics for s 66C(2) offences, where there are multiple offences, are taken from a pool of 34. Of that number, all bar one of the sentences were for a term of actual imprisonment.
	
	
	I have also been referred to the sentencing statistics for s 61M(2) offences, (where there are multiple offences) are taken from a pool of 52, of which 83% of sentences were for a term of actual imprisonment.
	
	
	I am aware of the authorities in this regard and have referred to the statistics merely as a guidance as to a range of sentences.
	


Aggregate terms


	
	Given that there was one victim, with approximately the same kind of criminality involved on the sexual assault offences, this is an appropriate matter where there should be an aggregate sentence imposed.
	
	
	It then becomes necessary to indicate what sentences would have been imposed in relation to the various counts.
	
	
	I indicate the following sentences would have been imposed for each offence:
	


i.   Count 1


	
	A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment
	


ii.   Count 2 (indecent assault)


	
	A non-parole period of 24 months with a balance of term of 12 months
	


iii.   Count 3


	
	 A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment
	


iv.   Count 4


	
	A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment
	


v.   Count 5


	
	A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment
	


vi.   Count 6 (indecent assault)


	
	A non-parole period of 8 months with a balance of term of 4 months
	



	
	That aggregate sentence will effectively reflect a period of partial accumulation of 15 months on each of the sexual intercourse counts (counts 1, 3, 4, and 5).
	
	
	As noted elsewhere in these remarks, the sentence for counts 2 and 6 (aggravated indecent assault) will be wholly concurrent with those on the aggravated sexual intercourse matters.
	


Special circumstances


	
	This has been the offender’s first time in custody. He has limited English. He is aged 65. There is no expression of remorse or contrition. That is generally regarding as a first step on the pathway to rehabilitation. He is 65 and assessed as having a low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	His circumstances are likely to mean that he will find imprisonment more onerous than younger English speaking offenders. He has no prior convictions, nor blemishes on his correctional history. Accordingly, I find that special circumstances exist and vary the statutory ratio to one of two thirds (67%) of the head sentence.
	


Sentencing options


	
	It is not appropriate to impose any lesser penalty other than a period of actual imprisonment, given the circumstances of the offences and of the victim, Ms MP.
	
	
	In any event, an intensive correction order may not be made in respect of a sentence of imprisonment for offences of this nature: s 66 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Commencement date


	
	The offender has been in custody, bail revoked, since 28 May 2015. The offender was also in custody for early periods, bail refused, which relate solely to this offence.
	
	
	His sentence date will reflect the totality of those periods in custody.
	


Sentence   

1.   Taking into account a finding of special circumstances, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the offender is sentenced to an aggregate period of imprisonment of fifteen years to be served by way of a period of non-parole imprisonment of ten years commencing on 15 March 2015 and expiring on 14 March 2025 with an additional term of five years imprisonment expiring on 14 March 2030.

Recommendations for custody

2702736,R v Duffy (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 1321,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 1 June 2012 the offender was arrested and charged with the murder of Colleen Deborah Ayers on 9 May 2012. He was also charged with breaking and entering the dwelling house of Judith and Bryon Green and committing a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation being in company with Rachael Evans and Scott Derbridge. Rachael Evans was charged with the same offences.
	
	
	Rachel Evans pleaded guilty on 19 May 2014 to the charge of murder. At the sentence hearing in relation to that plea the Crown presented a further indictment that on 9 May 2012 in the dwelling house of Judith and Bryon Green, Rachael Evans did steal certain property being an X Box console, games, mobile phones, jewellery, a 12 gauge shotgun and a double barrel shotgun, the property of Judith and Bryon Green. Rachael Evans pleaded guilty to that offence. The offence of breaking and entering the dwelling house was not proceeded with. A further offence of furnishing false information to a licensee, in relation to pawning some of the stolen items, contrary to the Pawnbrokers and Second Hand Dealers Act 1996 (NSW) was taken into account on a form 1 attached to the offence of steal in a dwelling house.
	
	
	At the commencement of his trial, when the offender was indicted, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased by Rachael Evans. The Crown did not accept that plea. He also pleaded not guilty to the offence of break, enter and steal but pleaded guilty to the offence of stealing in the dwelling-house. The Crown did not accept that plea. The trial on the counts of murder and break, enter and steal then proceeded.
	
	
	The jury found a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, and a verdict of not guilty on the break, enter and steal charge. Although there is some doubt about the continuing status of the plea to being an accessory after the fact, both parties have submitted that I should not sentence the offender in respect of that charge, and the Crown has submitted that the plea should simply remain on the file. It is accepted that the offender is to be sentenced, therefore, for manslaughter and for stealing in a dwelling-house.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. The maximum penalty for steal in a dwelling house is seven years imprisonment and there is no standard non-parole period.
	


Facts


	
	On the evening of Tuesday 8 May 2012, Rachael Evans was at CC's pub located on Queen Street, Campbelltown. While there she met the deceased and they started talking. I shall refer to the deceased as Debbie because that is what her family called her. She was variously referred to as Colleen and Debbie by the participants in the events of those days. At some point in the evening, the offender and Rachael’s sister, XY, joined Rachael and Debbie.
	
	
	The group of four boarded a train at Campbelltown train station and travelled to Picton. They checked into the George IV Inn which is located on Remembrance Drive, Picton. At the hotel the offender, Rachael and Debbie engaged in sexual activity with each other. XY filmed the incident on a mobile phone.
	
	
	On the morning of Wednesday 9 May 2012, the group left the hotel and travelled by train from Picton to Campbelltown. The offender and Rachael bought some drugs which the offender said was speed but which Rachael said was methamphetamine, and the group stayed in Mawson Park, Campbelltown, consuming the drugs and alcohol. It is not necessary to decide which of the two drugs was bought and consumed. There is undoubted evidence that the offender, Rachael and Debbie consumed speed, marijuana and alcohol in considerable quantities on the day before, and the day of, Debbie’s death.
	
	
	A friend of XY's, Scott Derbridge, had been to the Centrelink Office in Campbelltown that morning and bumped into XY. Derbridge went with her to Mawson Park where the offender, Rachael and Debbie were.
	
	
	At some stage the group was joined by Marc Carran, known by the group as ""Kiwi"" or “Nozzy”. As the evening progressed, Carran became highly intoxicated and was asleep for the majority of the events set out in these facts. He was not able to give any meaningful evidence about what happened.
	
	
	Whilst the group were at the park Debbie and XY went to an ATM where Debbie withdrew a few hundred dollars. She gave that money to XY who gave it to Rachael. It was used to buy methamphetamine.
	
	
	At some stage, Debbie told the group about her parents' rural property. She told the group that her parents were away and that all of them should go back to her parents' place for drinks.
	
	
	Later that day the group of six travelled by train to Picton. Some more alcohol and drugs were purchased, and they travelled in a Maxi Taxi to 220 Rockbarton Road, Lakesland, which is Debbie’s parents’ home.
	
	
	The property is situated on approximately 25 acres of land. On the property is the main residential house, a two bedroom detached guesthouse and a shed located at the rear of the main residence. There is a large garage underneath the guesthouse. Judith and Bryon Green were the owners of the property. Both Mr and Mrs Green are licensed to hold firearms. Before travelling interstate on 4 May 2012, they believe they locked and secured the property. Debbie did not have permission to enter the premises.
	
	
	The group went into the property accessing first the separate guest house and the garage, and subsequently the main residence and detached shed. They started a fire in the yard of the property and they spent much of the night between the fire and the guesthouse consuming drugs and alcohol.
	
	
	At one point during the night the offender and Debbie went into the main bedroom of the guest house. They could be heard having sex. Derbridge and XY went into the second bedroom to lie down because XY was feeling unwell. Rachael remained in the lounge room crushing Seroquel tablets.
	
	
	What thereafter happened is the subject of conflicting evidence. Ultimately, there were only two accounts of what happened in the bedroom – the account given by Rachael and the offender’s account. XY gave evidence that she was not in the bedroom at the time Debbie was killed. I do not believe her evidence in that regard but, of course, she gives no account of what happened until she went into the bedroom, as she claimed, after Debbie was killed. At that point she said the offender was kneeling on the bed near Debbie’s legs.
	
	
	It is necessary for me to make findings consistent with the jury’s verdict. Any findings adverse to the offender must be beyond reasonable doubt. However, I am not obliged to make the findings that are most favourable to the offender.
	
	
	Rachael’s account is that she and XY entered the room whilst the offender and Debbie were having sex. Rachael whispered to the offender that they were going to bash Debbie. Debbie was face down on the bed. The offender was on his knees straddling Debbie over or near her backside. XY hit Debbie with a bottle on the head. The offender said, “Get the belt”, and XY took a belt which was over the end of the bed and handed it to Rachael. Rachael put it around Debbie’s neck and pulled on it. However, Debbie bucked in such a way the Rachael was knocked off balance onto the floor. At that point the offender took hold of the belt and pulled on it. XY held Debbie’s legs down. At one point Debbie said, “No, please”. Then Debbie stopped breathing.
	
	
	The offender’s account is that whilst he and Debbie were lying next to one another on the bed Rachael and XY came into the bedroom. Debbie was lying on her back. The offender immediately jumped off the bed to the side of the bed. Rachael put a belt around Debbie’s neck, Debbie tried to get up and XY hit her on the head with a bottle. Rachael pulled on the belt from behind Debbie’s head and within 30 seconds Debbie went limp. The offender was just standing by the bed “freaking out”. At no time did anyone, including Debbie, say anything.
	
	
	There are a number of aspects of the offender’s evidence which make his account too incredible to believe or else they mean that he is a person of exceptional callousness. His evidence was that he simply stood by and let these two women kill the person with whom he had just been having intimate sexual relations in front of him without raising even so much as a protest. Then, although he wasn’t sure whether she was dead or alive, his main concern was to shield his mate Marc from seeing what had happened. So, he and Marc went down to the fire and had a few drinks.
	
	
	He then went back up to the granny flat and, not knowing still whether Debbie was alive or dead, he did not check to see what her condition was. Instead, he went onto the verandah and called to Rachael to come out and talk to him. She said they were going to rob the house. He did not call triple 0 he said because his phone was out of credit, evidence I reject as an invention in the witness box. Although he was worried that his DNA, which was on record, would be on Debbie, he said nothing to Rachael or anyone about that. Instead, he saw a shovel and decided to dig a hole to bury her without telling Rachael that that was what he was going to do.
	
	
	In the light of what the offender undoubtedly did after Debbie was killed (the failure to assist her himself, the failure to call for any assistance, the burying of her body by him in a grave dug by him, the stealing of the guns, his demeanour and behaviour in the taxi afterwards, and his ongoing dealings with Rachael that day and thereafter) I reject his evidence that he was not involved in her killing and that he simply stood by shocked and “freaking out” as he described it.
	
	
	What I find happened in the bedroom is this. The offender and Debbie were having sex on the bed. Rachael and XY entered the room with the intention at that stage, at least of hurting Debbie, principally because of the bad blood that had developed during the night between XY and Debbie, resulting in two arguments where, at one stage, they had to be physically separated. Whether or not Rachael whispered to the offender that they were going to bash her I cannot say, but it soon became clear to the offender, who knew of the discord between XY and Debbie, that Rachael and XY intended at least to assault Debbie. XY hit Debbie with a bottle. Rachael then put a belt around Debbie’s neck.
	
	
	When Rachael put the belt around Debbie’s neck Debbie was face down on the bed - that was the way her body was seen by Rachael, XY and Derbridge after she had been killed. I reject the offender’s evidence that Debbie was lying on her back when she was attacked. The offender was kneeling over or next to Debbie and put pressure on her back and/or her arms to hold her down. Evidence in the post-mortem report identified bruising on the right lower back, the back of the upper right arm and the back of the right wrist all of which occurred before death. The offender did not know that Rachael intended to inflict grievous bodily harm nor intended to kill Debbie, nor did he intend that Rachael’s actions would produce such results. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender himself pulled on the belt. I am, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender assisted Rachael to do an act which was an unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	Why he did so is difficult to understand. It is clear, however, that he and Rachael had been in a sexual relationship right up to this time. She was a dominant personality, and it may be that the offender was trying to please her by assisting her in what she was doing to Debbie. Her intentions seem to have been borne out of a combination of jealousy for what was going on between the offender and Debbie, and a desire to support her sister against Debbie.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Rachael, XY and Derbridge that Debbie cried out whilst she was being assaulted. She said either “please, no” or “please stop” or “please don’t”. I reject the offender’s evidence that Debbie said nothing. The offender must have known that what was being done to Debbie was unwelcome and was being resisted by her. He did not, however, cease his assistance to Rachael even though he did not intend to cause Debbie really serious injury or worse.
	
	
	I do not accept the offender’s evidence that he went down to the fire after the killing and had a few drinks before coming back up to the house. No other person present supports that evidence. I find, rather, that the offender and Derbridge went to dig the hole down behind the dam on the property.
	
	
	After the offender and Rachael buried Debbie in the shallow grave they returned to the fire area. The offender said that when he and Derbridge went to put the shovels away Derbridge pointed out a small box underneath the floorboards in the double garage. When they investigated they found it contained ammunition. The offender admits that he and Derbridage then went looking for guns in that area and in the shed behind the house. They found a gun safe. They looked for bolt-cutters and when they located them the offender cut the lock on it and stole the two guns. Meanwhile, Rachael and XY were stealing other items from the main house as the offender admitted knowing at the time. He admitted at the trial that he played his part by going to look for the guns. I find, therefore, that there was a joint criminal enterprise with, at least, Rachael Evans, to steal all of the items identified.
	
	
	One of the guns was later sold by the offender and Rachael for $600 to someone at a drug dealer’s place. The offender and Rachael shared the proceeds equally. The other gun was handed to the police by a friend of the offender’s at whose place the offender had left that gun. When I sentenced Rachael Evans the agreed facts provided to me stated that the 12 gauge shotgun was sold for $6000 but they were unable to sell the other gun. In her evidence at this trial Rachael agreed that she had deliberately inflated the price they received when she was interviewed by the police. She agreed that the true figure was $600.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	I accept that the act which resulted in the killing was not premeditated. I reject the evidence of Scott Derbridge that there was any conversation in Mawson Park or elsewhere prior to the group going out to the Lakesland house where anyone expressed an intention to kill Debbie or hurt her. The offender’s involvement in the killing was, in the first instance, spontaneous, but there was quite sufficient time for him to have ceased his involvement as he agreed in his evidence at the trial. Even on his own account it took at least 30 seconds before her body went limp. I have determined that Debbie called out for them to stop doing what they were doing. The offender could have ceased his involvement at that point and/or prevented her death. He must have known that what was happening was a serious assault. It would be apparent to anyone that putting a belt around someone’s neck and pulling it was a dangerous act indeed. There was no reason for him to have assisted Rachael in what she was doing.
	
	
	I repeat what I said when I sentenced Rachael Evans (R v Evans [2015] NSWSC 254 at [77]):
	


The killing of [Debbie] was gruesome and apparently pointless. Prior to the events concerned she was not known to the offender [Evans], Duffy or anyone else in the group. She had engaged in sex with them the day before and presumably thought they could be trusted because she invited them to her parents’ home. Then, when at the house, at one minute she was simply engaging (again) in sexual congress with Duffy, the next she was at the mercy of two and probably three persons who, it must have been apparent to her, were intending to harm and kill her. Death did not come instantly. There was evidence that she had called out to the perpetrators to “Stop it”.

I do not include the present offender as one who intended to kill her.


	
	The offender submitted by his counsel that the relevant unlawful and dangerous act was the striking by XY with the bottle and the joint criminal enterprise concerned that assault. The submission must be rejected for a number of reasons. First, the striking with the bottle was not the act that caused Debbie’s death. The lack of any evidence of damage to Debbie’s head as the post-mortem examination demonstrates, means that any blow struck could not have been very hard. Secondly, the offender asserts that there was no planning for the offence. In those circumstances, where without warning XY struck Debbie with the bottle after entering the room, it is difficult to point to any joint criminal enterprise before that assault. Thirdly, on the offender’s own account the belt was put around Debbie’s neck before she was struck with the bottle. This submission is inconsistent with that evidence. Finally, the joint criminal enterprise on which the jury’s verdict was based was between Rachael and the offender not XY and the offender. The unlawful and dangerous act was the pulling on the belt around the neck, with which act the offender assisted as I have described.
	
	
	His failure to attempt to assist Debbie when her body went limp, including his failure to ring for help, are aggravating features. So too was the use of the belt (a weapon), the fact that the offence was committed in company and the fact that the offence occurred in Debbie’s parents’ house, even though she was not supposed to be there when they were not there. She had invited the group to her house and she was entitled to feel safe there.
	
	
	It is an aggravating feature that the offender dealt with Debbie’s body in the way he did in order to try to cover his own involvement in her death. That was made worse by the fact that he buried the body on her parents’ own property. He then joked about her absence to the taxi driver and he subsequently lied to the police about any involvement on his part.
	
	
	I assess the manslaughter offence above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In relation to the stealing offence I accept that the offence was not pre-planned. Having now heard the evidence of the offender, which was not available to me when I sentenced Rachael Evans, that there was no discussion of guns being at the property before they went to the property, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender formed an intention in advance to seek out and steal the guns. Neither XY nor Derbridge gave evidence to that effect. Only Rachael did so, and whilst that was partly an admission against her interest it was also consistent with her endeavouring the put blame onto the offender.
	
	
	However, when the offender came across the ammunition he then went looking for the guns and broke into the gun safe to steal them. He did not simply happen across the guns. To that extent, there was some planning. The offence is aggravated by having been committed in company. I consider that it is an aggravating factor that the stealing took place from a property to which the offender had been invited by Debbie and with which Debbie had a connection, it being her parents’ home.
	
	
	It is a matter of concern that one of the guns was then sold to someone at a drug dealer’s house. The combination of drugs and guns has the potential to be, and often is, a lethal one. I accept on the basis of R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 that I am not sentencing the offender for the sale of the firearm, but its ultimate disposition is a matter I can and should take into account.
	
	
	I assess the stealing offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness particularly because guns were stolen.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The offender was aged 31 at the time of the offences and is now aged 34. He was the youngest of four children and he told the psychologist, Istvan Schreiner, that he had a good upbringing and had maintained a reasonable relationship with his parents. He has had a number of serious relationships and has a daughter, now aged about 12, from one of those relationships.
	
	
	After leaving school the offender had a number of different jobs including landscape gardening, various labouring jobs as a council sub-contractor, working as a gyprocker and a forklift driver. It was not clear if the offender had work at the time of the events for which he is being sentenced.
	
	
	He told the psychologist that he first started using alcohol and drugs at the age of 16. He used marijuana, ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines regularly, and he started using methamphetamine in March 2012.
	
	
	His record of offences commences in August 1999 when he was convicted of driving whilst disqualified. On his third such offence only 2 years later he was sentenced to periodic detention for 6 months. Although his offending may be regarded as being at a low level it includes assault, contravening domestic violence restrictions, break and enter, and behaving in an offensive manner. He has been given suspended prison sentences, home detention and a second order for periodic detention. His record entitles him to no leniency.
	
	
	Mr Schreiner concluded that he had no symptoms of a diagnosable mental disorder nor pre-existing personality disorder. On the Carlson Psychological Survey he was classified as an offender Type 1. This type is characterised by drug and alcohol abuse. Individuals within this type, Mr Schriener said, are usually concerned about getting into trouble but show little motivation to change. They are sociable and friendly with no apparent hostile behaviours. However, due to long-term drug and alcohol abuse they may have a quick temper that may result in impulsive behaviour.
	
	
	Mr Schreiner said that the offender’s responses during the assessment suggested an acknowledgement of important problems and the perception of a need for help in dealing with these problems, particularly drug and alcohol use. Mr Schreiner thought that with appropriate long-term goals, family support and abstinence from alcohol and drugs, the risk of offending was minimal.
	
	
	I have been provided with a number of references from family friends and from his mother. It is clear that the offender has the support of his parents. The referees all express surprise that someone from the loving family that they know could have committed such a terrible crime. Their only explanation, a view I share, is that it came about from the offender’s choice of associates and immersion in illicit drugs, and I would add, alcohol with those drugs.
	
	
	I have also noted the certificates tendered on behalf of the offender showing the courses he has completed whilst in custody.
	
	
	I have some reservations about the extent of the offender’s remorse. His behaviour after the offences, as I have said, showed a callous disregard for Debbie and what he had done. Having participated in her killing, he buried her body in a hole he dug, and proceeded to search for and steal guns. His demeanour and conversation in the taxi afterwards showed no concern at all for what had happened.
	
	
	Over the next week or so he continued to buy and consume drugs. In fact, the first thing he did after the taxi arrived back at Picton was to go to his friend’s hose with the group to smoke more marijuana and to see if they could sell the guns with the assistance of his friend. Then, having stopped briefly at his parents’ house, he and Rachael went to a drug dealer’s house in Leumeah “to go and score some more speed” as he said. He also bought some heroin “to get myself out of it so I didn’t think of what had happened the night before”. Some days later on Mother’s Day he had Rachael stay over at his parents’ place. A few weeks later he went to Campbelltown Court with her for a case involving XY.
	
	
	In his first ERISP on 1 June 2012 he not only lied about his involvement but spoke in demeaning terms about the sex he had with Debbie on the night she was killed.
	
	
	Mr Schreiner reported that when the offender told him of the night in question, he displayed a somewhat detached and logical approach to describing the events. He gave Mr Schreiner a similar account of what happened to what he gave at the trial, minimising his own involvement to being a mere onlooker. However, contrary to what he said at the trial about jumping off the bed when Rachael and XY entered the room, he told Mr Schreiner that he had had sex with Debbie at that point and he was in the process of dressing when they entered the room.
	
	
	His evidence concerning any remorse at the sentencing hearing was this:
	


Q. What do you think when you reflect back on your behaviour, what do you think about yourself?

A. I was a mess, yeah, not happy with what I was doing.

Q. What about being involved in the death of Ms Ayers, how do you feel about that?

A. I'm very - I don't really know how to put it into words, yeah, about what I did.

Q. Do you think about that from time to time?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you think about Ms Ayers' family?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you think about how they feel?

A. I can't fathom I can't fathom how they feel. I've never had that happen, so I can't understand how they would be feeling.

Q. How did you feel when you heard the victim impact statements read?

A. Shocked.


	
	In my opinion the offender has shown only minimal remorse for what happened to Debbie and his participation in it.
	
	
	Debbie’s sister, Tracey, read a heartfelt Victim Impact Statement. A further Victim Impact Statement from Bryon Green, Debbie’s father, was tendered. The evidence at trial disclosed that Debbie had some problems of her own. Her son, who was aged 14 at the time, was living with Mr and Mrs Green. It is clear that Debbie was loved by her family and that they were trying to assist her to resolve her problems. The Court again extends to all of Debbie’s family its deep sympathy for their loss.
	
	
	The minimal remorse which I have found is not unconnected with his prospects of rehabilitation. Despite Mr Schreiner’s opinion, referred to earlier, I am less sanguine about the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. Of concern is that fact that, despite being in custody related to a crime that occurred in the midst of what can only be described as a drug and alcohol binge, the offender has continued to use illicit drugs. The offender gave evidence that the last time he used illicit drugs was about 18 months ago. He has received punishments whilst in custody related to some of this continued drug use. Moreover, nothing in Mr Schreiner’s report suggests that he was aware the offender had on occasions continued to use illicit drugs in custody.
	
	
	Further, when the offender was asked by his counsel at the trial what drugs he had used and was using at the time of the relevant events at no stage did he admit to using methamphetamine. The first time such admission was made was to Mr Schreiner when he said in March 2012 he was experimenting with methamphetamine. At the sentence hearing he admitted, but only in cross-examination, to using it at first every couple of weeks, and then more regularly after he got addicted to it, after the first month of trying it. Such a lack of honesty, under oath at his trial, of what drugs he was using is a reason to have considerable doubts about accepting his evidence about his intentions regarding drugs, and to have considerable reservations about his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The offender said that he intends to do courses in prison related to drug rehabilitation. Once he is released, he said, he will probably start going to AA and Narcotics Anonymous again. He said that he stopped using drugs 18 months ago because of the thought of what he was doing to himself and he didn’t want to be that kind of person any more.
	
	
	I consider that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation can only be considered to be on the low side of average. If his involvement in Ms Ayers’ death was not sufficient to persuade him not to go on using illicit drugs, although he described it as a big wake-up call, I have serious doubts that mere reflection on what he was doing to himself and on the type of person he was, will be sufficient to bring about a change. He will need some assistance with rehabilitation.
	


Plea and assistance


	
	The offender pleaded guilty to the stealing offence at the earliest opportunity. He is entitled to a discount of 25% for that plea.
	
	
	The offender submitted that he should receive a discount for facilitating the course of justice pursuant to s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). He said that the following matters were relevant:
	



	
	He admitted being present at Lakesland and being present when Debbie was murdered;
	
	
	He admitted disposing of the body;
	
	
	He admitted stealing the guns from the property.
	



	
	I do not consider that there was any facilitation of justice in respect of these matters. There was abundant evidence of the offender being at the property and of being present in the room when Debbie was killed. Even to the time of his interview with Mr Schreiner I do not consider that the offender has been honest about the extent of his participation in Debbie’s killing. There was also evidence of three other witnesses concerning the offender’s disposing of the body. Those admissions had no effect on shortening the trial or limiting the evidence which was led. In relation to the admission of stealing the guns, I have discounted his sentence for that admission contained in his plea.
	


Deterrence


	
	In my opinion both general and specific deterrence are considerations of some significance for a terrible crime occasioned by, and in all probability brought about by, the offender and the others involved having consumed large quantities of alcohol and illicit drugs over two days or longer. There is nothing to indicate, however, that, despite that ingestion, all of the participants were unable to make rational decisions including the cover-up of the crime and the stealing.
	
	
	Given that there are no psychiatric or psychological issues, apart from drug and alcohol abuse, that can explain what happened, the offender bears a high moral culpability for the abuse and death of a vulnerable young woman.
	


Parity


	
	Rachael Evans pleaded guilty to murder. Scott Derbridge was sentenced as an accessory after the fact to murder. There is no issue of parity involved in relation to either of their sentences.
	
	
	In relation to the stealing charge to which she also pleaded guilty, Rachael was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years which included a modest discount for the plea. There was a Form 1 offence attached but I considered that it arose as a consequence of the stealing offence and did not result in any increased penalty for the stealing offence. On the evidence I had at Rachael’s sentence hearing I considered that the stealing offence had been planned at the park before the group left for Lakesland. I have not made such a finding in relation to this offender. At the time of the offending Rachael was on conditional liberty, and she had prior offences on her record as does the offender, including, as I have said, a break and enter. Derbridge pleaded guilty to break, enter and steal. Before discounts for plea and assistance, the Sentencing Judge said that his sentence would be a head sentence of four years “notwithstanding what might be seen to be his lesser role in this event”. I have had regard to both of those sentences when fixing a sentence on the stealing charge.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 1 June 2012. That is a period of 3 years 3 months and 18 days. The sentence will be backdated to that date.
	
	
	The starting point for the stealing offence should be 2 years 9 months. With a 25% discount for the early plea the sentence will be a fixed term of 2 years.
	
	
	I consider that the appropriate non-parole period for the manslaughter is 8 years with an additional term of 4 years.
	
	
	There should be some accumulation for the stealing offence. The two offences were separate but were committed in close proximity.
	
	
	I find special circumstances by reason of the offender’s need for rehabilitation and because of the accumulation of the sentences.
	
	
	Micheal John Duffy, for the offence of steal in a dwelling-house I convict you and I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 1 June 2012 and expiring 31 May 2014. For the manslaughter of Colleen Deborah Ayers I convict you and I sentence you to a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 1 March 2013 and expiring 28 February 2021 with an additional term of 4 years expiring 28 February 2025.

		20 April 2017",2015-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702750,R v Wood [2015] NSWDC 354,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a good father and husband who is highly regarded by his employer. I am sentencing him because - despite this good standing - the man allowed himself to become so infatuated with a teenage member of his extended family that he raped her while they were together in a car on a country road.
	
	
	When a judge sentences an offender, the judge needs to say what happened in the crime and to make an assessment of how serious an example of this crime is. The judge must also take into account the personal circumstances of the offender whom the judge is sentencing.
	
	
	At the start, however, I should say what I am sentencing the man for. His name is Vincent Wood [this is a pseudonym]. I should add that that name is not to be published outside this courtroom apart from members of his family who know that he is involved in this case. The reason for that is that it is against the law in New South Wales to publish the name of a person who complains that they were sexually assaulted. In this case, Vincent Wood is the brother-in-law of Emily Saffron [another pseudonym] the victim of his sexual assault. She is not to be identified outside this courtroom except by members of the immediate family who already know about this case and her involvement.
	
	
	The crime that I am sentencing Mr Wood for is called aggravated sexual assault. It is made into an offence by s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that offence. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of ten years to the offence. In this case, Vincent Wood committed the aggravated sexual assault - which is more specifically described as having sexual intercourse with another person without their consent in circumstances of aggravation and knowing that the other person does not consent - against his sister-in-law. That is, the sister of his wife. The particular circumstance of aggravation is that the victim of his offence was under his authority at the time of the crime. She was in fact a 17-year-old student who was living in his household in regional New South Wales.
	
	
	I will start by pointing out that Mr Wood pleaded not guilty to the crime. He acknowledged that he had engaged in sex with Emily Saffron in the car on the occasion in question but said that the sex that they had was consensual. He maintained that plea of not guilty but a jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt and I formally convict him of that crime if I have not already done so.
	
	
	Emily Saffron, as I said, is Vincent Wood’s sister-in-law. She spent a good amount of time living with Vincent Wood’s family. It was not in regional New South Wales, as I earlier mistakenly said, but in a regional town of Victoria. She was 17 at the time of this offence. The offence I might add occurred in July 2007. Emily Saffron was living with Vincent Wood and his wife and their five children. She was going to a local high school and had a part time job locally. She did chores within the household and when asked by the Crown Prosecutor how she felt her position was in the household, she replied, “Just another child in the house at the time”.
	
	
	However, to his discredit, Vincent Wood became sexually infatuated with his sister-in-law. He claimed that she behaved provocatively towards him, including on the occasion that he committed this offence. There was an occasion earlier than this offence which occurred in Victoria. Something occurred which is not itself an offence in New South Wales nor is it an aggravating factor which I take into account but, as Mr K Gilson the Crown Prosecutor said, it puts this crime in context and also indicates that Vincent Wood knew what Emily Saffron’s attitude was to any sexual advances towards her.
	
	
	They were out driving in the countryside in regional Victoria. Ms Saffron said that “Vincent turned the music off and he tried to put his hands on me”. She added that he tried “to put them in my pants”. She was yelling at him because she had not expected it to happen and she tried “to force his arm off me, his hand on me”. He then stopped and “lent back over into his seat”. I repeat, that is relevant because it indicates that Vincent Wood knew that Emily Saffron was not interested in sexual engagement with him.
	
	
	The occasion in question that I am sentencing him for occurred in these circumstances. Part of Vincent Wood’s wife’s family lived in NSW so a number of members of the family took a road trip from regional Victoria to NSW. They stayed there for a few days. Then either Vincent Wood or Emily Saffron or both of them needed to be back in regional Victoria for school or job commitments. They undertook the journey back from NSW to regional Victoria. On the way they stopped for some petrol which was probably at Yass. Vincent Wood produced from the back seat a bottle of Bourbon which he mixed with a soft drink and Emily Saffron drank some; she thought about two cups. Vincent Wood drank some alcohol as well. Emily Saffron then took a pill which Vincent Wood produced and it seems to be common ground that the pill was an ecstasy tablet. They were not on the freeway but what Emily Saffron described as an “old main road”. The car was parked by Vincent Wood. (He was driving.) Ms Saffron does not remember much about where they were except that she does recall a “paddock, a farm, farm land”. It sounds as though it was somewhere between Yass and Albury because she thought the next big town or city was Albury.
	
	
	Mr Gilson asked her what happened when they pulled over “near or adjacent to some paddocks” and she replied that she remembered waking up to “Vincent’s fingers in there”. She was in the passenger’s seat in the car and she elaborated by explaining that his fingers “were in my vagina” and she thought that it lasted a “few minutes, maybe”. She confirmed that she did not want him to do what he did nor invite him to do it and that as soon as she objected to him doing it, he withdrew his fingers. She also said she felt sick but acknowledged that that was probably because of the alcohol which she had had to drink.
	
	
	So that is the crime which Vincent Wood has been convicted of. It is sexual intercourse because it involved the penetration of Emily Saffron’s vagina with his fingers without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. The likelihood is that she was asleep or unconscious at the time and he therefore knew that she was not consenting. The circumstances of aggravation were, I repeat, that he sexually penetrated a teenage girl who was a member of his household and regarded herself as just like one of the other children in the household at the time. I should add that at the time of the offence she was 17 and he was 35.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the personal circumstances of Vincent Wood. He has a criminal record but it is quite negligible. There are a couple of offences of offensive language and a traffic offence. There is, I acknowledge, a robbery in company but that was committed in 1990 and was in fact dealt with by the Children’s Court. I regard his criminal record as being negligible for the purposes of sentencing him.
	
	
	There is a presentence report which has been prepared by Community Corrections. It records that he had a positive upbringing. He was born overseas and migrated to Australia with his family when he was five. He had supportive relationships with his parents and his siblings. The presentence report noted that Mr Wood lives with his “ex-partner” and their five children aged between 12 and 19. The relationship lasted some 21 years and “ended approximately three years ago due to the nature of the current offence”. They are still on good terms. The report noted a positive reference from his employer. I too have such a reference. The report noted that he felt somewhat tipsy and had taken an ecstasy tablet at the time of the offence but that seemed to be the only drug and alcohol issue in his history. It noted that “Mr Wood does not deny what occurred between himself and the victim however claimed it was consensual; that the victim was flirting with him and he was ‘stupid’”. Mr Wood “denies giving the victim a tablet and says it was an ecstasy tablet which the victim took off his hand.”
	
	
	I add in that regard that is consistent with my finding. I also make clear that Mr Wood is not being sentenced for any offence containing an aggravating factor involving a stupefying drug or assaulting someone having plied them with alcohol. That would be a more serious offence. He is being sentenced for just the offence that I have described. By reference to one standard, the report indicated that Mr Wood had a low risk of re-offending and by another standard the assessment was a “low‑moderate risk range”.
	
	
	In addition to the pre-sentence report, there is a very large number of personal references for Mr Wood. They come from members of his family as well as people who know him in various circumstances including employment. Some have known him for practically all his life. Many of them refer to his strong sense of duty as it applies to his job, his family and his community. One referee refers to the fact that he “possesses a great deal of integrity, and constantly strives to make sure he is doing the right thing.” It is obvious from these references, as I said, that he is a very strong family man whose support extends not only to his own children but unselfishly to members of his extended family, particularly when they are in need of support in one way or another. I have read all of the references and they present a picture of a good father and husband who is highly regarded by his employer and by others in the community.
	
	
	There is one reservation which I have about the references. Almost all of them have as a subject line “sexual intercourse without consent (under authority)”. Very few, if any of them, otherwise refer to the circumstances of this offence. The Crown Prosecutor picked that up and argued that none of the references reflects a knowledge of the fact that he admitted to having sexual intercourse with a girl under his care. Naturally, of course, his account was that it was by consent. Many of the references refer to a man of integrity with a strong moral code. I do not doubt that those references are true in what they say, but they are references concerning a man who admittedly engaged in inappropriate relations with a teenage sister-in-law. The references themselves verify, in my opinion, aspects of his character but do not acknowledge a serious lapse in his behaviour by not referring to some knowledge of what he has admitted to and what he has been found guilty of. As I say, I do take them into account but they are limited somewhat in their impact.
	
	
	Despite the submissions of Mr K Buckman who appeared for Mr Wood, I do not find that there is evidence of his client’s remorse. I agree with Mr Buckman that there is evidence that he regrets what he did with his teenage sister-in-law and acknowledges the impact which it has had on her, but at the same time he maintained that he was not guilty of any criminal offence and Emily Saffron was required to come to court and to give evidence and be cross-examined about the circumstances of the offence. Again I make clear that Mr Wood is not being punished for the fact that Emily Saffron had to give evidence against him. I make that observation simply in the context of an argument that he should be regarded as displaying some remorse or contrition. Although he has displayed remorse for his immoral behaviour, I do not accept that he has demonstrated remorse so far as it is a relevant factor in sentencing him under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The offence itself was not premeditated or planned. In that sense it is not aggravated. However, it was not simply opportunistic. Mr Wood did set off on a long car trip with his teenage sister-in-law - with whom he had an inappropriate sexual encounter some time before – with a bottle of bourbon and ecstasy tablets in the car. I repeat, I do not find it was premeditated but nor was it simply opportunistic and out of the blue.
	
	
	It did occur, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, in a car in an isolated spot in the countryside. Mr Wood knew that Emily Saffron had rejected his advances beforehand. He did take advantage of the fact that the 17 year old girl who was under his authority and in the car with him was at the time influenced, no doubt, by the effect of the combination of alcohol and drugs, perhaps tiredness, who knows, but it is clear that she was not aware of when he had penetrated her but became aware when he withdrew his fingers at her request. In other words, whatever she was influenced by, probably a combination of drugs and alcohol, he took advantage of her circumstances in a car in an isolated spot.
	
	
	There was no victim impact statement. I do not say that critically. Its impact is obvious - indeed the courts do not need evidence of the fact that a sexual assault will have a significantly traumatic impact upon the victim. That is one of the reasons why Parliament regards the crime as so serious and fixes such a high penalty on offences like this. Ms Saffron was, to my observation, upset and perhaps traumatised by the process of giving evidence. The crime obviously had the kind of impact on her that one would expect this serious offence of personal violence to have on a young girl.
	
	
	As Mr Buckman reminded me, there are other forms of sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse, of course, could be the insertion of a penis into a woman’s vagina, it could involve ejaculation, it could involve risks of pregnancy or disease. This is the insertion of a finger or fingers. How serious it is depends upon the facts and circumstances which were present at the time. I have described those and I agree with Mr Buckman’s assessment, which is supported by Mr Gilson’s, that for this offence it falls towards the lower end of seriousness for this crime.
	
	
	One must bear in mind that circumstances of aggravation include inflicting actual bodily harm - or threats to do that - or breaking into a house and raping someone or doing it with another person present. A judge needs to make some kind of assessment of how serious an example of the crime a particular offence is. I agree with Mr Gilson and Mr Buckman that it falls towards to the lower end of objective seriousness for this kind of crime. Mr Buckman argued that it was of brief duration. There is some force in that argument but it was not brief in the terms of seconds; it was brief in the terms of some minutes.
	
	
	Mr Buckman put forward some argument to the effect that his client may be sentenced to a penalty which did not involve full-time custody. That submission must be rejected. The steps involved in determining that a sentence cannot involve custody mean that the judge has to decide first what the sentence is and it needs to be as low as about two years. This is not a crime where the penalty can be so low. One needs only look at the maximum penalty which Parliament has fixed to the crime and to the standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	Normally when a judge fixes a sentence the judge will fix a non‑parole period. I will fix a non-parole period after I have sentenced Vincent Wood. Normally the non-parole period is 75% of the head sentence. I will reduce that to about 60% because I think there are special circumstances for doing that. There are not many but one of them is that he will probably have to serve his time in custody in protection.
	
	
	I regard an appropriate sentence in this case, taking into account all that I have said, as being one of five years imprisonment and I would regard an appropriate non-parole period as being three years imprisonment.
	
	
	I set a non-parole period of three years to commence today, 10 September 2015. That will expire on 9 September 2018. The balance of the term is two years commencing 10 September 2018 and expiring on 9 September 2020.
	
	
	Vincent Wood, your sentence is five years imprisonment. You have a non‑parole period - that you must stay in gaol for - of three years. You will go into gaol today on 10 September 2015 and you will be eligible for parole on 9 September 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.


	
	Your overall sentence will expire on 9 September 2020. Mr Gilson, Mr Ryan, is there anything else that I need to attend to? I don’t think so.
	


GILSON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s not for me to fix parole, it’s the Parole Authority. So far as I am concerned - I will go off the bench - if he wants to talk to his relatives here before he goes down he may, but that’s a matter for Corrective Services. I will leave that to you.

GILSON: There are no matters that arose that I could see, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Gilson, thanks Mr Ryan.

		08 February 2016",2015-09-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702751,R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2015] NSWSC 1315,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused are charged that:
	


“…between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 December 2002 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [the accused] did conspire with each other and divers other persons with the intention of dishonestly influencing a Commonwealth public official, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, in the exercise of his duties as a public official.”


	
	At the close of the Crown case the accused each applied for a verdict by direction upon the basis that there was no case to answer. I am disinclined to accede to those applications. My brief reasons for coming to that decision are as follows.
	


Legal principles


	
	The applicable principles are not in doubt. As long ago as 1955 the High Court stated the position in May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658:
	


""When, at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is 'no case to answer', the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law.""


	
	The question to be determined is a question of law. This was confirmed in Zanetti v Hill [1962] HCA 62; (1962) 108 CLR 433.
	
	
	In The Queen v Bilik  (1984) 36 SASR 321, King CJ said this at 335:
	


“The question of law is whether on the evidence as it stands the defendant could lawfully be convicted. He could lawfully be convicted on that evidence only if it is capable of producing in the minds of a reasonable jury satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	His Honour continued at 337 in these terms:
	


“The case against the appellant…was circumstantial in character. The same test is to be applied to deciding a submission of no case to answer in a case depending upon circumstantial evidence as in a case depending upon direct evidence, although the manner of its application will be different. The question to be answered by the trial judge is whether there is evidence with respect to every element of the offence charged which, if accepted, could prove that element beyond reasonable doubt. Where there is direct evidence of the actus reus and that evidence is capable of supporting an inference of mens rea, there is a case to answer except in the extreme case…in which the direct ‘evidence’ is so incredible as to amount to no evidence. Where the case is a circumstantial or partly circumstantial case and therefore depends on inferences, the question may be expanded so that it becomes: On the assumption that all the evidence of primary fact considered at its strongest from the point of view of the case for the prosecution, is accurate, and on the further assumption that all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which are reasonable open, are drawn, is the evidence capable of producing in the mind of a reasonable person satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused? That, as it seems to me, was the question which the learned trial Judge was required to answer in deciding on the submission of no case to answer.”


	
	A court hearing a no case submission is bound to take the prosecution case at its highest. In Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-214 the High Court stated:
	


“There is no doubt that it is a trial judge’s duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.

…

It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory (as to which see Whitehorn, Chamberlain v. The Queen (No.2) [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 and Morris v. The Queen [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454) nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process (as to which see Jago v. District Court (N.S.W.) [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23) provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial. Nor does the existence in a trial judge or a court of powers to stay process or delay proceedings where the circumstances are such that the trial would be an abuse of process.”


	
	The application of the test was considered recently in R v PL [2102] NSWCCA 31. Bathurst CJ said this at [32]:
	


“[32] It is also clear from the authorities that the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a conviction is to be resolved without regard to evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by qualifying, contradicting or explaining the evidence in support of a conviction (see R v R supra at 81, 84-85). Further, in a case such as the present which depends in the main on circumstantial evidence, a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case on which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated: R v JMR supra at 44.”


	
	I am alive to the suggestion that on one view of the evidence the jury would, and perhaps even should, find the accused not guilty of the offence charged. That is, however, not the test. As long as I am bound to proceed upon the basis that the case ought to be left to the jury if they could find the accused guilty, I consider that in this case I am bound to reject the applications. I have referred to and am required to take account of the fact that the prospect that a jury might be found unreasonably to have convicted the accused is a concern of the Court of Criminal Appeal and not of a trial judge. Whatever ultimate outcome this trial produces, it is not possible for me at this stage, proceeding consistently with binding authority, to direct the jury return a verdict of acquittal. There is at least some evidence upon which the jury could convict the accused. It is unnecessary at this stage to elaborate upon or identify what that evidence might be. I observe in passing that the alleged status of Chambers Finance Limited as “like a merchant bank” and cognate representations might qualify as examples of such evidence. I recognise immediately, however, that there are several available hypotheses consistent with innocence which could be, and which have in the course of detailed written and oral submissions already been, formulated by counsel for the accused. Undoubtedly those submissions will find a significant place in the final addresses of counsel.

2702754,Safe Work New South Wales v Waycon Bulk Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 254,"Judgment


	
	Waycon Bulk Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to:
	



	
	An offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Edward Murray, an employee of the offender, to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act (the section 32 offence); and
	
	
	An offence of failing to notify the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales of a notifiable incident, being the injury to Mr Murray contrary to section 38 of the Act (the section 38 offence).
	



	
	The maximum penalty for the section 32 offence is a fine of $1.5 million. The maximum penalty for the section 38 offence is a fine of $50,000.
	
	
	On the sentence hearing, Mr Chin appeared with Mr Parkin for the prosecutor and Mr Van Aalst appeared for the offender.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts for each offence. These Statements can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender conducted a business producing and supplying firewood, and providing bulk haulage services. At the relevant times, Wayne Campbell was the sole director of the offender.
	
	
	In or about September 2012 Mr Campbell placed an order with Hursts’ Engineering Pty Ltd for a wood splitting machine that was designed and manufactured to meet the requirements of the offender (the machine). The machine was delivered to the offender in or about February or March 2013.
	
	
	The machine had two splitting rams with blades attached. The two rams/blades were controlled by two people operating independently on opposite sides of the machine. The ram/blade took 4-5 seconds to fully descend.
	
	
	At the time of delivery of the machine to the offender a ram/blade would only descend where an operator simultaneously depressed two buttons located underneath the splitting table. If the operator removed their hand(s) from one or both buttons the ram/blade would retract. This was to protect the operator from the risk of injury to their arms and hands, by reason of the descent of the ram/blade.
	
	
	On one side of the machine there was an emergency stop button and controls for the gate of the bin in which blocks of wood were held. Once a block of wood was released from the bin onto the work-table, galvanised hooks were used by employees to position the block beneath the ram/blade.
	
	
	At some time between the delivery of the machine and the incident, Mr Campbell authorised the modification of it so as to allow an operator to cause the ram/blade to extend by pressing only one button. This modification was thought to be safer as it allowed employees to have one hand free to defend their face or chest area in the event that a log ‘exploded’ when it was split by the blade.
	
	
	Edward Murray commenced employment with the offender as a “woodsplitter” on or about 8 April 2013. Mr Murray had worked in the timber industry, and had worked for Mr Campbell about five to six years prior to the incident. At the time of the incident Mr Murray had not operated a wood splitting machine for approximately two years.
	
	
	On 15 April 2013 Mr Murray was working with another employee operating the machine. He commenced work at 1:00pm and was due to finish at 9:00pm. Mr Murray was working on the left side of the machine being the opposite side to where the emergency stop and other controls were located. At the time of the incident no other employees were present.
	
	
	At approximately 8:00pm, Mr Murray moved a block of wood directly under the splitting ram/blade. The block was not sitting correctly and the wood would not slide easily as there was insufficient oil on the work surface. Mr Murray leaned across the machine, placing his right hand on top of the wood block to enable him to dislodge it. In the process of leaning over the machine Mr Murray’s right thigh pressed one of the buttons activating the ram/blade. Mr Murray’s right hand was severed above the wrist. The other employee retrieved Mr Murray’s hand before driving him to hospital. The other employee phoned Mr Campbell to inform him of the injury to Mr Murray and that Mr Murray had been taken to hospital.
	
	
	The offender failed to notify the WorkCover Authority of NSW that the incident had occurred. The Regulator was notified of the incident on 17 April 2013 by the police.
	
	
	At the time of the incident there was an Australian Standard (AS 4024.2601-2008) (the Standard) which applied to all two-hand control devices including the machine. Clause 6.2 of the Standard required that two-hand control devices be designed in such a way as to require an operator to use both hands simultaneously, i.e. one on each control in order to operate the device.
	
	
	The modification of the machine to allow rams/blades to be activated with only one hand meant that the machine failed to comply with clause 6.2 of the Standard at the time of the incident.
	
	
	At the time of the incident there were no guards around the buttons to prevent them from being depressed inadvertently. There were no documented procedures which employees were required to follow when operating the machine.
	
	
	Following the incident the offender’s employees continued to use the machine in its modified configuration.
	
	
	On 19 April 2013 the offender was directed by WorkCover Inspector Yates to return the wood splitter to its original state; requiring two buttons to be depressed to activate the extension of the ram/blade. This direction was complied with whilst Inspector Yates was present. Inspector Yates took some video footage on that day of the operation of the machine in its modified and original state.
	
	
	The offender installed metal guarding around the buttons at some time between 19 April 2013 and 27 June 2013.
	


Additional evidence for the prosecution on the section 6 Fines Act 1996 issue


	
	The Prosecutor also read an Affidavit of Sandra Margaret McCarthy, affirmed on 26 June 2015. Inspector McCarthy’s affidavit annexed the notices issued to the offender and the Trust pursuant to section 155(2) of the Act and the responses and documents received by the prosecutor as a result, which included a copy of the Deed of Trust dated 1 July 2002 (the Trust Deed).
	


Video evidence


	
	The footage of the operation of the machine taken by Inspector Yates on 19 April 2013 was played to the Court. The footage depicted the following relevant matters.
	
	
	In the clip entitled “Demonstration splitting large block” the footage depicted the ram/blade to descend slowly and steadily before splitting the block. The machine was being operated in its modified form. The operator used his hands to manoeuvre the block into place and then used his hands to sweep the wood that had been split towards the rear of the machine. In so doing, the operator’s hands were moved under the blade as it was rising and when it was fully retracted. In cross-examination when shown this footage, Mr Campbell accepted that this was an inherent part of the process.
	
	
	In the clip entitled “Single button dual operators” the operator was seen on a number of occasions to lean towards the bin where the blocks of wood were stored to bring them closer to the ram/blade in preparation for them to be split. In so doing, the operator’s leg came close to the button that would have caused the ram/blade to descend if the machine was operating in its modified form.
	
	
	Both of the clips to which I have referred showed the operator with his hand on top of the block of wood whilst it was in the process of being split or shortly thereafter on a number of occasions. As I understood the evidence this was the thing that that Mr Campbell expressly instructed the operators not to do and was in his opinion the cause of the injury sustained by Mr Murray. In further support of this was the observation from the footage that the ram/blade reached full extension at a height of about 10-15 cm above the splitting table, meaning that it was necessary for Mr Murray’s arm to be caught between the blade and a block of wood in order for it to be severed.
	
	
	In the clip entitled “Dual button operation” the ram/blade ascended when the operator took one of his hands off one of the buttons. Further, a piece of a block being split flew to the left hand side of the operator at high speed. The operator reacted with a hand movement after the piece of wood had passed him. The piece of wood did not appear to hit the operator. This phenomenon was what Mr Campbell said in his interview with Inspector McCarthy was the reason for the modification of the machine.
	


The offender’s evidence


	
	The offender read an Affidavit of Wayne Campbell affirmed on 6 April 2015. Mr Campbell was cross-examined on 4 September 2015. The offender also read an affidavit of Connie Campbell sworn on 6 April 2015. Mrs Campbell was present at the sentence hearing but was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Campbell maintained in cross-examination that he had authorised the modification of the machine and had done so to allow operators to have one hand free to protect themselves from exploding pieces of wood. Mr Campbell gave evidence that it was quite uncommon for pieces of wood to explode and that had never seen such an event before. Mr Campbell understood prior to modifying the machine that the two button operation was a safety feature designed to keep the operator’s hands and arms away from the descent of the ram/blade. Mr Campbell said that operators would have a 50/50 chance of being able to defend themselves from flying wood if they had one hand free. He accepted that this method relied on the reflexes of the employees and that he had no idea how effective it was. Mr Campbell agreed that he had not looked into alternative measures to protect employees from this risk.
	
	
	Mr Campbell agreed that he knew at the time of modifying the machine that from time to time operators would pass their hands under the blade to sweep the wood away and that it was an inherent and necessary part of the process. He also agreed that he knew that operators would put their hands on the top of the blocks of wood being split, but that he gave them verbal instructions never to do so.
	
	
	The offender is the trustee for the WJ & CA Campbell Family Trust (the Trust). Connie Campbell acts as the bookkeeper and maintains the financial records of the Trust. Annual tax returns and quarterly BAS for the Trust are completed by accountants Logan & Hall Pty Ltd. Financial reports for the Trust for the 2013 and 2014 financial years were annexed to Mr Campbell’s affidavit.
	
	
	Mr Campbell was cross-examined about the structure of the Trust. Funds for the Trust are derived from the operation of the offender and the assets used by the offender in the course of the business are beneficially owned by the Trust. The beneficiaries of the Trust are Mr and Mrs Campbell, their three children and Waycon Logging Pty Ltd (Waycon Logging). Waycon Logging has acted as a guarantor for certain loans of the offender, and the offender is a major shareholder of Waycon Logging.
	
	
	A copy of the record of interview between Mr Campbell and WorkCover Inspector Sandra McCarthy dated 27 June 2013 was annexed to Mr Campbell’s affidavit. Mr Campbell was questioned as to some of the answers provided in this interview. In that interview, Mr Campbell stated that the injury to Mr Murray was “his own fault”. During cross-examination Mr Campbell agreed that he was still of that view.
	


Consideration

Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of forseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk presented by the modification of the machine was obvious. It involved the circumvention of the safety features of the machine and rendered it non-compliant with the Standard.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact that the machine was modified to ameliorate an alternative risk, being the risk of injury from an “exploding” piece of wood from the splitting process. The alternative risk was a risk of minor injury. The offender did not require its employees to wear any protective equipment to prevent injury to their faces, other than specifying that they should wear glasses, for which sunglasses would suffice. There was no evidence that an employee had ever suffered a facial injury. The risk of injury to the torso area was one involving a contusion or bruising. There was no evidence that an employee had ever suffered such an injury.
	
	
	The decision to modify the machine was inappropriate and ill considered. The offender did not investigate any other means of ameliorating the alternative risk. The modification of the machine created a risk far more serious than the alternative risk it was intended to address.
	
	
	The verbal instruction given to the workers by the offender not to place their hands on top of the blocks of wood was in no way capable of preventing the injury that occurred. Further, the verbal instruction was not being enforced by any or any adequate supervision of the workers during the course of the operation of the machine.
	
	
	The risk included a risk of serious injury by way of the amputation of a hand or part of an arm and also the risk of death as a result of the blood loss that would accompany an amputation.
	
	
	The risk caused by the modification of the machine was only present for about 1 to 2 months prior to the incident.
	
	
	The continued operation of the machine after the incident in its modified form is an aggravating feature of this offence: R v Wilkinson (No 5) at [61]. The machine was not returned to its original state until the offender was ordered to do so by the WorkCover Inspector on 19 April 2013.
	
	
	The conduct of the offender fell very considerably short of that expected by a reasonable employer of workers who were required to use a machine that was capable of inflicting serious injury and/or death.
	
	
	The section 38 offence was explained by an ignorance of the requirement on the behalf of the offender.
	


Deterrence


	
	General deterrence is of significance in this case. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses which are inherently dangerous to employees that it is necessary to ensure that they operate without avoidable risk to the health and safety of their employees.
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence in this case. The offender should be punished for taking active steps to disable an in built safety mechanism without any or any proper consideration of the consequences that may flow from that. Further, whilst the offender no longer operates the supply of firewood business it continues to conduct a logging operation which is inherently dangerous to its employees and the penalty should draw its attention to the need for compliance with the relevant legislation.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Van Aalst on behalf of the offender conceded that I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury to Mr Murray was substantial.
	


Mitigating factors.


	
	The offender does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that the offender has operated the supply of firewood business for some time, although the evidence does not enable me to understand precisely how long that period was. The offender was incorporated on 3 June 2003 and I am prepared to infer that it operated the business from about that time.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The prosecutor accepted that the offenders plea was an early one. In the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Mr Van Aalst submitted that I should also find on the balance of probabilities that the offender has demonstrated remorse in the context of section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In my view the evidence does not permit me to do so. Put simply, there was no relevant evidence in the Affidavit of Mr Campbell, or in his oral evidence that the offender accepted responsibility for the failures that led to the injury to Mr Murray.
	


The relevance of the offender’s position of trustee of the Trust


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	


In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:

(a)   such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

(b)   such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	In this case, the bulk of the evidence led on behalf of the offender related to the financial position of the Trust and I had initially assumed that it was led to persuade me to exercise the discretion provided for in section 6 Fines Act 1996. However, the ultimate submission was not based on section 6 but on the application of the law of trusts.
	
	
	Mr Van Aalst submitted that the Trust was not a sham and that as a result the offender, as trustee for the Trust was not beneficially entitled to any of the income or assets referred to in the financial accounts. He further submitted that the offender only had control over its issued capital in the sum of $2.00 and it followed that imposing any penalty on the offender would be futile because:
	



	
	it could not meet any fine in excess of $2.00; and
	
	
	it owed a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the Trust. It could not therefore act to provide for the payment of the fine, because to do so would not be in the best interests of the beneficiaries and the Appointor of the Trust (Mr Campbell) would be required to appoint an alternate trustee to prevent it from doing so.
	



	
	Mr Van Aalst was unable to provide any authority for the proposition that the Court should not impose a fine in circumstances where it would be futile to do so, based on the offender being a trustee of a trust.
	
	
	Mr Van Aalst further submitted that the offender had been upfront with the prosecutor on this point and invited the Authority to join the Trust to these proceedings, so that recourse could be had to the income and assets of the Trust.
	
	
	The principles set out in Jahandideh at [16] are sufficient reason to reject these submissions out of hand. However, the submissions are also fundamentally flawed for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the Trust is not a separate legal entity that can be prosecuted under the Act.
	
	
	Second, the offender has admitted in the Statement of Agreed Facts that it was the business or undertaking that had the relevant health and safety duty that was breached, and to suggest that some other entity was responsible would involve a traversal of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Third, the submissions insofar as they relate to the inability of the prosecutor to enforce any fine reflect a lack of understanding of the law of trusts. The definition of “Trust Fund” in clause 1.18 of the Trust Deed is in my view wide enough to include all of the income and assets identified in the financial statements that are said by Mr Van Aalst to be beyond the trustee’s reach. Further, the trustee’s right of indemnity provided for in clause 14 of the Trust Deed is from the Trust Fund and is expressed in the broadest possible terms, and expressly includes the trustee’s right to be indemnified that is provided for by Trustee Act 1925 as well as the trustee’s right to be indemnified that arises from the common law. In the event that the trustee chooses to exercise its discretion to avoid paying a lawfully imposed fine, it would be open to the prosecutor to take action in the Supreme Court to have the trustee removed and replaced with a trustee that would comply with its legal obligations. The Supreme Court also has power to order how the powers provided for by the Trust Deed are exercised by the trustee or the Appointor, to ensure that the trustee will comply with its legal obligations. The result that the beneficiaries will ultimately bear the burden of Mr Campbell’s decision is not unjust, because they also stand to benefit from the existence of the Trust.
	
	
	Mr Van Aalst submitted that in the event that I did not accept his futility submission that he did not require me to consider the financial material as relevant to a question under section 6 Fines Act 1996. Accordingly, I will not do so.
	


Penalty


	
	A conviction and the imposition of a fine for each of the offences is required in this case. The offender is convicted of both offences.
	
	
	I have had regard to the Victim Impact Statement prepared by Mr Murray dated 2 March 2015. I consider it appropriate to do so.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account the appropriate penalty in relation to:
	



	
	the section 32 offence is a fine in the sum of $250,000; and in relation to
	
	
	the section 38 offence is a fine in the sum of $10,000.
	



	
	In recognition of the early plea of guilty both of those fines are to be discounted by 25%.
	
	
	In relation to the section 32 offence I impose a fine of $187,500 and in relation to the section 38 offence I impose a fine of $7,500.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fines are to be paid to the prosecutor.
	


Costs


	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.

		05 November 2015",2015-09-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702756,Ha v Kang [2015] NSWDC 211,"Judgment


	
	This is an application pursuant to r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) for rulings in relation to the form of imputations of a slander alleged to have been published on or about 7 February 2015. The imputations pleaded are as follows (paragraph 6 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff took part in an assault on Kiu Nam Cho.
	
	
	The Police have alleged on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff took part in an assault on Kiu Nam Cho.
	
	
	But for a lack of evidence, the Police would have prosecuted the plaintiff for assault.
	
	
	Sooner or later the Police will prosecute the plaintiff for assault.
	



	
	As this is a slander, the parties have agreed that it is inappropriate for there to be a separate trial on capacity pursuant to r 28.3 UCPR and that these issues should await the trial.
	
	
	The plaintiff brings an application pursuant to r 14.28 challenging the form of imputations 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d). These are my reasons for rulings on 10 September 2015.
	


Imputation 6(b)


	
	Mr Richardson submits that the form of the imputation does not accurately capture the sting of the plaintiff being suspected by the police on reasonable grounds of having taken part in the assault. Not only does the form of the imputation failed to specify an act or condition of the plaintiff, but it is capable, Mr Richardson submits, of equally suggesting guilt, as well as suspicion.
	
	
	The manner in which an imputation of being reasonably suspected by the police of having committed a crime should be framed is set out in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671 (per Hutley JA) and 678 (per Glass JA). As Glass JA at 678G to 679B, where the imputation is intended to convey not merely that the police suspicion is reasonably based but that the charge itself is well founded, that is a very different imputation from one of reasonable suspicion.
	
	
	Imputation 6(b) is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Imputation 6(c)


	
	Mr Richardson submits that the sting of imputation 6(c) is that it is only the current lack of evidence (as opposed to absence of reasonable grounds) that has so far prevented the plaintiff from being prosecuted. It amounts to a statement that there is no evidence on which to prosecute the plaintiff for assault and accordingly does not convey an act or condition about the plaintiff with sufficient precision to convey a defamatory sting.
	
	
	Mr Rollinson, in his short written submissions, agreed that the imputation in its current form was intended to convey that lack of evidence was the reason for the plaintiff not being charged with the offence. What, however, is the defamatory sting arising from this imputation?
	
	
	Mr Rollinson stated that the imputation was intended to convey that it was only thanks to chance or good luck that the evidence in question was not available, and that the plaintiff’s days of freedom were numbered. If so, an imputation pleading that act or condition should be formulated with precision. In its current form, the imputation simply fails to capture the meaning for which he is searching.
	
	
	Imputation 6(c) is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Imputation 6(d)


	
	The plaintiff’s failure to formulate an act or condition in relation to this imputation is compounded by its close similarity to imputation 6(c).
	
	
	Mr Rollinson submitted that the defamatory sting was intended to be that the defendant had requested that the police reinvestigate the matter, and that the plaintiff was bound to be prosecuted sooner or later, adding that “the plaintiff has so conducted himself as to warrant the reasonable suspicion which exists”.
	
	
	However, that is not clear in the current form of the imputation, which must specify an act or condition, differentiate between suspicion and guilt, and differ from the other imputations pleaded. Accordingly, this imputation is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Costs and other issues


	
	The defendant had been successful in this application and the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs. I note the parties have agreed to defer the issue of capacity to the trial. The words spoken, including the tone of voice, any relevant body language and the context in which the words are spoken will be issues which will be the subject of evidence at the trial. In those circumstances, the decision of the parties to defer those issues to the trial is a sound one, and I note that the rulings on the form of the imputations set out above do not in any way touch upon the issue of capacity.
	


Orders


	
	Note the parties’ agreement that issues of capacity are reserved to the trial, as these are proceedings for slander.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28, the plaintiff to replead imputation 6(b) as an imputation of “reasonable suspicion” (Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669).
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28, grant leave to the plaintiff to replead imputations 6(c) and 6(d).
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s amended statement of claim in 7 days.
	
	
	Defence 21 days thereafter.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions to Thursday 8 October 2015

		23 September 2015",2015-09-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702758,R v Moore [2015] NSWSC 1263,"Judgment


	
	Kieran Moore seeks a certificate under s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW). The application comes after the Director of Public Prosecutions ordered that there be no further proceedings against him. That decision followed a ruling excluding certain evidence that the prosecution sought to adduce: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189.
	
	
	Mr Moore was originally charged with murder along with a co-accused (Tony Simmons). The murder charge was discontinued and he was arraigned in relation to one count, that being an allegation that he was an accessory after the fact of the murder committed by Simmons. There was a pre-trial hearing during which a number of questions of admissibility were ventilated: see R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143 and R v Simmons (No 3). Following my ruling in R v Simmons (No 3), the learned Crown Prosecutor who appeared in the trial sought time to consider the position that the prosecuting authorities would then take with respect to those proceedings. On Friday, 13 March 2015, I was advised that the director discontinued the proceedings in relation to Mr Moore. By s 2(1)(a) the jurisdiction to grant a certificate arises.
	


The legislation and case law


	
	The question of whether a certificate should be granted requires a consideration of the form of the certificate provided in s 3:
	


“Form of certificate

(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:

(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and

(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.”


	
	The somewhat unusual nature of that test has been considered in a number of cases and I have considered what was said in the appellate courts in Reg v Williams (1970) 91 WN (NSW) 145, Allerton v DPP (1991) NSWLR 550, R v Fesja (1995) 82 A Crim R 253, R v Pavey (1997) 98 A Crim R 396, R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; 49 NSWLR 203, R v Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197 and Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121; 171 A Crim R 510. There have also been a number of cases decided by single judges of this Court: see for example Warick Ian MacFarlane (Supreme Court (NSW), 12 August 1994, unrep), R v Dunne (Supreme Court (NSW), 17 May 1990, unrep), R v Krishna [1999] NSWSC 525, R v Cardona [2002] NSWSC 823 and R v Tooes [2008] NSWSC 291.
	
	
	The section requires the decision maker to assume that the hypothetical prosecutor had knowledge of “evidence of all the relevant facts” at the time of the institution of the proceedings. The question is whether, in the light of that retrospectively obtained knowledge, “it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings”.
	
	
	A number of propositions can be gleaned from the cases: –
	



	
	The provisions represent a “middle course” between two extremes: Allerton v DPP at 161-162, citing the second reading speech introducing the provision. One extreme is the common law and English position where costs were granted in criminal cases only in exceptional circumstances: Attorney-General of Queensland v Holland (1912) 15 CLR 46 at 49. The other extreme is where costs almost automatically follow the event: Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534.
	
	
	The provisions are intended “to create an environment in which earlier rigid resistance to the reimbursement of costs incurred by an acquitted defendant was diminished”: R v Manley at [74] (Simpson J).
	
	
	The provisions allow the Court to relieve a person who has been acquitted (or discharged following the withdrawal of proceedings by the DPP) of the financial burden of defending themselves in criminal proceedings without casting any criticism on police or prosecutors. Because of the retrospective wisdom implicit in s 3(1)(a), the provisions “when applied judicially permit courts to make orders in appropriate cases without any innuendo arising from the making, or the refusal to make such orders that would be critical either of the Prosecutor or the accused”: see Allerton v DPP at 560 – 561.
	
	
	The prosecution cannot resist a certificate on the basis of some “ill-defined community interest in bringing a particular accused, or kind of matter, before the courts”: see R v Manley at 206-207 (per Wood CJ at CL); see also R v Pavey at 401.
	
	
	“It is not sufficient to establish the issue of unreasonableness in favour of an applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word; in a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury; it would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit”: Mordaunt at [36].
	
	
	A decision to prosecute is not “reasonable” simply because there was a prima facie case, or because there were reasonable prospects of a conviction, or because a magistrate committed the matter for trial: R v Warwick Ian MacFarlene cited with approval in R v Fejsa 255.
	
	
	The applicant’s silence is not a disentitling factor under s 3 (1)(b). In other words, the failure of an applicant to participate in a recorded interview is not a matter that “contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings”: see R v Manley at [74] – [76]; R v Dunne; R v Pike and others [2010] NSWDC 224 at [12].

The evidence


	
	In addition to the evidence that established that Mr Russell was dead, that Simmons had a well-known animosity towards him and that Moore and Simmons were closely associated with each other at the time that Mr Russell went missing, the prosecution intended to rely on four strands of evidence that it argued implicated the applicant in the disposal of Mr Russell’s body.
	
	
	First, there was the evidence of recorded conversations between Mr Moore and witness Jodie Biles which occurred at the Bloomfield Hospital on 1 and 6 September 2011. The relevant parts of the conversations are set out at [24]-[35] of Simmons (No 3). As I indicated in the judgment, the evidence contained no direct admissions by Mr Moore that he was involved in the alleged murder or its aftermath. However, the conversation was capable of being used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on his part.
	
	
	For example, Mr Moore was recorded as saying:
	


“Tell him to pull his head in and stop talking shit… because otherwise it’s just gonna cause more dramas because they still haven’t found no body, you know, as long as you bloody, there is no evidence.”


	
	He also made comments to Ms Biles concerning whether or not other people who may have had knowledge of the disappearance of Andrew Russell and the possible involvement of Mr Simmons (and Mr Moore) would remain “staunch”. With reference to a witness called Jakey Peters, Mr Moore said that “[I] reckon he’ll stay staunch” and “Jakey will stay good”. The conversation recorded also included reference to various (according to Mr Moore) untrue stories that both Mr Simmons and Mr Moore had made up and told to other people.
	
	
	I rejected a submission that the evidence was inadmissible because it had been unlawfully obtained: see [73] to [80]. However, I excluded the evidence in the exercise of the “unfairness discretion” in s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The reasons for my doing so are encapsulated in paragraph [95] of the judgment.
	
	
	The second body of evidence excluded in the course of the pre-trial voir dire concerned evidence of “off the record” conversations between Mr Moore and the investigating police officers. There were various versions of that conversation and the circumstances leading up to it. I found that the conversation was elicited by means of an inducement, namely a promise or representation that the conversation would not be used in evidence against Mr Moore. That involved a finding of fact in relation to precisely what was said leading up to the admissions and an acceptance of evidence given by the applicant on the voir dire as to his understanding of what was said.
	
	
	The evidence showed that, having exercised his right not to be interviewed and having been placed under some pressure to say something by members of his family, Mr Moore (or his step-father) asked if he could speak to the detectives again. He then told the police “off the record” that he had been present in a car with Tony Simmons when Simmons told him to pull over because he had seen Andrew Russell and hated him. He said that he had pulled over and that Simmons got out of the car and bashed Mr Russell. At that point Mr Russell “didn’t wake up” and Simmons and Mr Moore moved his body to bushland nearby.
	
	
	The evidence was excluded pursuant to s 85 of the Evidence Act. I came to a conclusion that the circumstances in which the admission was made were not such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. Having reached that conclusion, the evidence was inadmissible pursuant to the terms of the section. I went on to indicate that I would also have excluded the evidence as being relevantly unfair pursuant to the discretion to exclude such evidence under s 90 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The third body of evidence came from statements made by Jodie Biles. In an interview dated 29 August 2011, Ms Biles said that Mr Moore told her that he and Tony [Simmons] had “killed Andrew for me”. She was asked “what was he saying” and she said:
	
	
	“A. Just that, um, they had killed Andrew. I don’t even know why he’d come out and say that though. There was nothing mentioned about Andrew or anything like that --- because I didn’t talk to, um Kieran. Me and Kieran weren’t friends at all, I hated him.”
	
	
	When asked whether he was serious she said “yes, he said it a few times.”
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submits that Ms Biles evidence lacked credibility and pointed to the animosity demonstrated between her and the applicant. He notes that in a subsequent and apparently comprehensive statement, there was no reference to this alleged admission. Mr Stratton SC also points to evidence given by Ms Biles on the voir dire in which he asked, “Kieran Moore never told you that he assisted in the disposal of Andrew Russell’s body; is that true?” and she replied “yes”. The submission is that the admission relied on is an admission to the crime of murder rather than being an accessory after the fact to the murder.
	
	
	The final piece of evidence to which the hypothetical prosecutor would have regard in determining whether to institute proceedings was the evidence of a witness called Luke Salter. Mr Salter took part in an interview with police on 18 January 2013 and said that he had overheard a conversation between the applicant and Steven Bayliss. He said:
	


“I was witness to Kieran Moore under the influence of drugs and alcohol crying, babbling, and pleading his case, to Steven Bayliss, and telling me everything that he knew about the incident and his involvement with Andrew Russell.”


	
	He said that he overheard Mr Moore saying that “it was an accident, how he got killed” and that “he was caught tamperin’ with one of Tony’s children.” This version of events seemed to involve Mr Russell hitting his head on a coffee table. He also said, “Tony overacted, and then when the consequence arrived and he got hurt, that they had to do something about it.” He told police that Mr Moore said they took the body to Sofala and that he “was involved in moving him out there to Sofala, and he would probably be able to take you straight to where he is buried.”
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Salter was attacked as being motivated by malice. For example, he described Mr Moore as “a degenerate. He’s a low life. He’s a druggy user and abuser … Just…filth”. He also said, “the only reason I’m here is I have a personal vendetta against Steven Bayliss, and if he can be brought directly into it, that would be fantastic.”
	


Submissions of the parties


	
	The hypothetical prosecutor would be aware that all of the evidence to which I have referred had weaknesses and may have been subject to objection. However, as Mr Stratton conceded, the hypothetical prosecutor is not assumed to know the outcome of the objections and rulings on the admissibility of evidence. In other words, for the purpose of the application of s 3, the prosecutor would not be aware that the evidence was ultimately excluded. I accept that concession and proceed on the basis that the “evidence of all the relevant facts” does not include the knowledge of the outcome of the objections and decisions following the voir dire. However, the hypothetical prosecutor would be aware of the potential for such evidence to be excluded and the evidence upon which objections may be based, including evidence given on the voir dire.
	
	
	Mr Stratton points to the inconsistencies between the various bodies of evidence as to precisely what occurred. He says that the admissions allegedly made to Biles were of a deliberate killing while the Salter admissions said the death was an accident. He submits that none of the particular admissions constituted an admission either to murder or to being an accessory after the fact to that crime. Even if it was capable of amounting to an admission to either of those crimes, the various versions were so inconsistent and so lacking in credibility that a reasonable prosecutor would not have instituted the proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Stratton submits that “the police should have been aware” that the Bloomfield Hospital conversations were “unlikely to be admitted into evidence”. He makes a similar submission in relation to the “off the record” admissions to police.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor did not seek to question the correctness of the rulings excluding the evidence but advanced the proposition that the rulings may have gone the other way. In other words, he submitted that it was open to have determined the exercise of discretion under s 90 favourably to the Crown and to allow the Bloomfield conversations to go to the jury.
	
	
	Similarly, the Crown submitted that the determination of the admissibility of the “off the record” conversation turned on an acceptance of the credibility of Mr Moore when he said that he believed that the evidence could or would not be used against him. Even in terms of the primary facts as to that question, there was a conflict in the evidence between what Detective Fawkner said and what Mr Fazio said. Ultimately, I accepted the evidence of Mr Fazio and based that finding substantially on what had transpired in the course of Mr Fazio’s recorded interview on 23 January 2013. He was asked what had been said earlier and he said (to Detective Fawkner), “Ah, you said ‘We can have a conversation off-record’”. The prosecutor relies on the fact that rejection of the admission turned on an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses called on the voir dire and the prosecutor contemplated by s 3 is not assumed to be aware of the outcome of such assessments or a trial judge’s finding as to the applicant’s state of mind.
	


Decision


	
	I accept the submissions made by the learned Crown Prosecutor on these issues. The hypothetical prosecutor envisaged by s 3 is assumed to have possession of the relevant facts and evidence. But that prosecutor is not to be attributed with the ability to predict what factual findings will be made either at trial or on the voir dire, let alone to be able to predict the exercise of discretion residing in the trial judge.
	
	
	There may well be cases where the legal principles are so clear that the hypothetical prosecutor ought not to attempt to tender evidence and where to do so will constitute an unreasonable exercise of the prosecutorial discretion for the purposes of the application of s 3 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW). Equally, there will be cases where the attack on the credibility of the evidence is so substantial that it would be unreasonable for the prosecutor to rely on the evidence of a particular witness either at trial or on the voir dire. An example of this can be seen in the case of R v Dunne where Hunt J held that a certificate may be appropriate where “the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit.” Another such case is R v Cardona [2002] NSWSC 823, where Hidden J found that the evidence of a critical prosecution witness “could not withstand scrutiny”: see also R v Krishna.
	
	
	However, this is not such a case. Even allowing for the manifest deficiencies in the credibility of the individual witnesses and the fact that each particular item of evidence may have been subject to attacks at the trial both in terms of the credibility of the witness who gave it and the extent to which it advanced the Crown case or was consistent with other evidence, the hypothetical prosecutor was entitled to look at the impact of the evidence taken as a whole. Further, the reasonable prosecutor was entitled to seek to adduce the evidence, not knowing what findings of credit would be made on the voir dire and how the trial judge’s discretion (where applicable) would be exercised.
	
	
	Taken collectively, the material available to the prosecution was such that it was reasonable to exercise the prosecutorial discretion to institute the proceedings. The prosecution, acting reasonably, was entitled to seek to tender the evidence of the accused’s “off the record” admission to being involved in the disposal of the body after Mr Simmons had (on those admissions) killed Mr Russell by bashing him. Whether that constituted accessory after the fact of murder would have been a question for a jury to decide had that material being allowed to be admitted. That admission would have gained some support from the evidence of what Mr Moore had said to Ms Biles which, at the very least, demonstrated some knowledge or awareness of the disappearance of Mr Russell. Similarly, the things that were allegedly said to Ms Biles and Mr Salter were capable of providing some support for the prosecution case that the applicant was involved.
	
	
	Even attributing the putative prosecutor with the retrospective knowledge assumed in the test created in s 3, I am unable to reach the conclusion that “if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.”
	
	
	Accordingly, the application for a certificate must be refused.

2702759,Ha v Cho (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 210,"Judgment


	
	These are proceedings for defamation, in which the form of the matter complained of had already been the subject of a ruling: Ha v Cho [2015] NSWDC 169. This judgment contains short reasons for the orders I made on 10 September 2015 concerning the pleading of imputation (b) as a fall-back to imputation (a).
	
	
	The imputations the subject of this ruling are:
	



	
	The plaintiff took part in an assault on the first defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff helped Horim Song to assault the first defendant.
	



	
	The parties agree that the question at the hearing will be whether the words spoken conveyed imputation (a), namely that the plaintiff took part in an assault, or the lesser imputation (imputation (b)), namely that he helped Mr Song to assault the first defendant without actually taking part in that assault. The question is the form in which those imputations should go before the tribunal of fact. Should the plaintiff be forced to choose between the two imputations, or to plead imputation (b) (which is agreed to be of lesser seriousness) as a “fall-back” to imputation (a)?
	
	
	The circumstances in which a party may plead “fall-back” imputations of lesser seriousness is set out in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [75]-[81], [88] and [132] per Hunt AJA. Santow JA stated at [7]:
	


“Finally, I agree generally with the observations of Hunt AJA on the undesirable pleading practice that appears to have arisen more recently in defamation proceedings. While those observations were not necessary for the disposal of the appeal, they were the subject of discussion in these proceedings, and have an underlying bearing upon applications to amend by adding new imputations. If the original pleading of an imputation adequately distils the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff there should be less likelihood of any need to amend by adding new imputations, particularly of the fall-back kind held back for unjustified forensic advantage.”


	
	However, these reservations about the use of “fall-back” imputations need to be read in context. The plaintiff in those proceedings had pleaded imputations at a higher level at a section 7A jury trial (s 7A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW)) in relation to a written publication and, when the jury rejected those meanings, sought to add additional imputations of lesser seriousness. That is not the case here. Both parties agree (as is reflected in the orders) that as this is a slander case, the nature of the imputations conveyed, and the defamatory sting, will depend very much on what is found to have been said. In those circumstances, it is entirely proper for the plaintiff to plead imputations (a) and (b). However, since it is conceded that they cannot arise at the same time, the preferable course is that submitted by Mr Richardson, namely for the plaintiff to plead imputation (b) as a fall-back to imputation (a).
	
	
	The Court of Appeal’s strictures were reserved for cases where too high an imputation is pleaded (for a recent example, see Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited [2015] FCA 652; Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2015] FCA 750). Nevertheless, fall-back imputations have a role to play in slanders, where an imputation of guilt or reasonable suspicion is pleaded (Provost v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 18 September 1998)) or where imputations of lesser seriousness are clearly capable of arising: Baboolal v Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd [2015] QSC 196 at [26].
	
	
	As the defendants were successful in their application, the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs.
	


Orders


	
	Note the parties’ agreement that issues of capacity are reserved to the trial, as these are proceedings for slander.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28, imputation (b) be repleaded as a fall-back to imputation (a).
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendants’ costs.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s amended statement of claim in 7 days.
	
	
	Defences 21 days thereafter.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions to Thursday 8 October 2015.

		23 September 2015",2015-09-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702767,R v Edwin Jitesh Chandra [2015] NSWDC 234,"Judgment

Charges

1.   On 5 June 2015, Edwin Jitesh Chandra (“the offender”) was found guilty by a jury on a charge brought pursuant to section 46 of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 (“Crimes Act”) that:

“On 24 December 2010, he intentionally used a substance, namely petrol, upon Mr Gurmail Saini (“Mr Saini”), and ignited it, causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Saini.”

2.   The charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence.

3.   The offender was acquitted on a more serious charge brought under section 27 of the Crimes Act of causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Saini with intent to murder him. That charge also carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

4.   A distinction needs to be drawn between this offence and an offence under s 33, which has the same maximum penalty and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

Relationship

5.   The offender was in a relationship with a woman known as Ms Mohini Sharma (“Ms Sharma”) from early 2009. They moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Ms Sharma commenced working as a carer with an organisation called Syd West Multicultural Services Inc and its sub-organisation, called “CALD Aged Care Services”. Ms Sharma was a carer for Mr Saini’s mother and wife. Mr Saini’s wife died apparently in or about September 2010. Sometime during 2010, Ms Sharma commenced a relationship with Mr Saini. There was conflicting evidence about the nature of that relationship. Mr Saini said that it developed into a sexual relationship which continued through 2010. That, and the other aspects of the relationship (as set out below), were denied by Ms Sharma.

6.   Ms Sharma’s evidence was that at the relevant time she was in a de facto relationship with the offender. She lived with him and a cousin at 37 Standish Avenue, Oakhurst.

7.   One of the subsidiary issues in the trial was the familiarity which Mr Saini had with the offender and Ms Sharma. Mr Saini said he knew they lived together with others, but thought they were cousins. Ms Sharma denied that she had indicated that – although her evidence in that regard was not impressive, particularly when she was shown a document in which she had described her relationship with the offender as a “cousin” (exhibit 23).

8.   Mr Saini’s evidence was that the arrangement between them was that he would meet with Ms Sharma at his home, 182 Blacktown Road, Blacktown, in his car, and at various Formula 1 motels around the western suburbs of Sydney sometimes once or twice a week and other times once a fortnight. Again, that was denied by Ms Sharma.

9.   Their practice was to arrange meetings by Ms Sharma first ringing Mr Saini, and leaving a missed call notification. Mr Saini would then ring back and they would arrange a meeting.

10.   Mr Saini’s evidence was that he and Ms Sharma had a meeting in a car in or about December 2010 around the back of Eastern Creek raceway, where they were discussing their relationship. The Crown case is that during the course of this conversation, Ms Sharma accidentally dialled the telephone number of the offender’s mobile phone. A short snippet of conversation was either heard by the offender, or recorded onto the offender’s phone, and then heard by him. Further, that once the offender became privy to the recorded conversation, and with it, the details of the intimate relationship between Ms Sharma and Mr Saini, he informed Ms Sharma of his knowledge and his intention to hurt Mr Saini.

11.   Mr Saini said on the voir dire, but not on the trial, that a few days after this event, Ms Sharma said to him, while she was looking after his mother, words to the effect of “I got caught, he (Edwin) heard everything. I left my phone on.”

Motive

12.   This sequence of events was relied on by the Crown as establishing a motive on behalf of the offender which led to him carrying out the act constituting the charge. It is also relevant as to the planning and premeditation which took place.

13.   The precise date of the conversation between Ms Sharma and the victim, Mr Saini, and the recording of it is unclear. However, the Crown has telephone records indicating a course of telephone calls between Ms Sharma and the complainant, Mr Saini, as well as from the accused to Ms Sharma. There is one call made from Ms Sharma’s telephone to the accused lasting approximately 11 seconds on 16 December 2010. Defence counsel points out that there are a number of calls shown on the records over the December 2010 period.

14.   A schedule sets out those calls and voicemails between Ms Sharma and the offender (MFI 15). There was a work schedule which shows when Ms Sharma was caring for the complainant’s mother at or about the relevant time. The Crown relies on the possible range of dates as being between 15 and 22 December 2010.

15.   The Crown submits that the offender’s motive for the commission of the offence was because he was upset, jealous and angry about the relationship between Ms Sharma and Mr Saini. This formed the basis for the circumstantial case mounted against the offender. That was essentially the only evidence before the jury as to the motive for this offence.

Findings

16.   The jury’s verdict, the evidence presented at the trial and the issues the subject of the addresses being essentially confined to the question of identification and the secondary question of intent, mandates a finding that the jury was satisfied that the offender was the person who carried out the act; further, that the defendant did not have the intent to murder or kill Mr Saini. The relevant intention was to pour petrol on Mr Saini and to ignite it. The planning and premeditation to carry out the acts is the subject of a separate finding – see below “Premeditation and planning”.

Ms Sharma: findings

17.   It is unnecessary for these purposes to make precise findings as to what occurred between Mr Saini and Ms Sharma. However, having observed Ms Sharma give evidence on both voir dire and during the trial as well as that of Mr Saini, I do not accept Ms Sharma’s account in any area where it conflicts with that of Mr Saini. Her evidence denying or not admitting that she wrote her phone number and that of the offender in the agreement she had made with the CALD aged care care services organisation and the description of the relationship with the offender as a “cousin” were particularly telling in this respect. In that regard Mr Saini gave evidence that he was introduced to the offender as Ms Sharma’s cousin.

18.   There may well have been other arrangements or motivations involving Ms Sharma as far as Mr Saini was concerned. In that regard there are either messages or phone calls made by the offender to and from Ms Sharma immediately before and after the incident. It is also clear that she made a telephone call to Mrs Parsin Kaur to say that she was going to Melbourne later on and that she would not be available to care for her.

Incident

19.   On 24 December 2010 the offender went to Mr Saini’s home. He was carrying a box of chocolates with him. Despite the warning he says was given to him by Ms Sharma, Mr Saini invited the offender into his home. It was his belief that he and the offender would be having a discussion on what, if anything, had occurred and what, if any, relationship there was which may have led to the offender “warning off” Mr Saini. Whatever Mr Saini’s state of belief, it is clear that he invited the offender into his home with the intention of having a discussion. He went to the stage of offering, and then going to make, the offender a cup of coffee.

20.   While Mr Saini went into the kitchen and within the time it took to do that, the offender went outside to the car and returned with a gas bottle or cylinder which he then used, without warning, to either spray or throw petrol or a similar accelerant onto Mr Saini. It is open to the clear inference that the offender went outside to retrieve the gas bottle or cylinder once he realised that the victim was not in the immediate company of anyone.

21.   The offender then set fire to Mr Saini.

Incident: findings

22.   I accept Mr Saini’s evidence in that regard and find that the offender came to Mr Saini’s home on a pretext of having a discussion consistent with his bringing a box of chocolates to Mr Saini’s home on Christmas Eve. Further, that once he went into Mr Saini’s home and convinced Mr Saini of his non-violent intentions, he then went out to his car and returned carrying the petrol or accelerant in some kind of small gas bottle or cylinder.

23.   This was not an opportunistic attack but rather a planned and premeditated attack by the offender on another man in that man’s home into which the offender had been invited for a social discussion.

Intention

24.   Defence counsel submits that an offence under s 46 is distinct from that of s 33, namely that because the charge was brought pursuant to s 46, the Crown only needed to prove that grievous bodily harm was caused by the intentional use of a substance, namely petrol. Accordingly, counsel submits that the offender should not be sentenced on the basis that he possessed an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, as this was not an element of the offence for which he was convicted.

25.   I find that the relevant intention was to pour petrol on to a substantial portion of the victim’s upper body, and to ignite it, thereby burning Mr Saini, which did cause grievous bodily harm.

26.   The Crown also submits that the act of leaving the victim in the state he was in was indicative of a complete disregard for the victim. I accept that submission. However I emphasise that the jury verdict of acquittal on the primary count means that the jury did not find that the offender acted with an intention to kill.

Flight

27.   After the incident, the offender went to Melbourne, and then after some days to New Zealand, where he lived between January 2011 and 1 December 2012. He was then identified, arrested and then extradited back to Australia on 13 March 2013.

28.   Ms Sharma lived with him in New Zealand for a substantial period of that time. After the offender’s detection by the New Zealand Police and his subsequent incarceration and deportation, she ultimately left New Zealand and returned to Australia on 9 February 2013.

29.   The Crown relied on that departure as evidence of flight by the offender to avoid detection and arrest. The defence disputed at trial that the departure was for that purpose. Ms Sharma’s evidence on the voir dire was that the offender went to New Zealand because he had children living there with whom he wanted to re-establish a relationship.

Flight: findings

30.   I find that the offender’s departure was for the purpose of avoiding detection and apprehension. That has led to the delays in bringing this matter to trial during which time the victim, Mr Saini, has had this matter hanging over his head without resolution. He has also had to give evidence in extremely traumatic circumstances for him. In that regard, the trial was delayed because Mr Saini could only give evidence for periods of 25 to 30 minutes of time because of his difficulties in breathing and the pain he was suffering. The trial was necessary – as was Mr Saini’s attendance to give evidence – because of the offender’s denial that he was the person who carried out the act.

Injuries

31.   Mr Saini suffered third-degree burns to 36% of his body. These included partial-thickness burns on his face, and full thickness burns on his neck, chest, and both upper limbs and hands.

32.   Audio evidence of the conduct of a photographic array was played which showed Mr Saini in hospital in January 2011 with extensive burns to his face and upper body – see below “Victim Impact Statement”.

33.   Mr Saini required multiple operations for debridement, and skin grafting of his neck, back, upper limbs and hands. He has had a pin inserted into his right hand, and other operations and scar releases for both hands. He anticipates that he will soon need to have a thumb amputated. He needs to have oil and moisturiser placed on his hand twice a day, and sometimes the skin bleeds on his shoulder as part of the process of relieving pressure following the burns. He suffers from intense itchiness which was apparent during the trial. He also has limited motion in his neck area.

34.   As a result of the offence, he also developed shortness of breath, and was found to have scarring of his vocal cords. This was clear during the trial when the victim required constant breaks during his evidence in Court. He required insertion of a tracheostomy and eventual laser cordotomy for these injuries.

35.   Mr Saini was in Concord Burns Unit for 3 months, and then underwent 3 to 4 months of rehabilitation at Ryde, as well as undergoing ongoing surgeries.

36.   His injuries are ongoing. He is on long term antibiotics and he has permanent scars with a changed appearance, significantly reduced function in both hands and upper limbs. He has been treated for ongoing depression. Having read the reports and the Victim Impact Statement (see below), and having observed the victim, it is clear that the injuries have had a catastrophic effect on his life.

Medical Report – Professor Peter Maitz

37.   Professor Maitz provided a medical report dated 23 June 2015, which became exhibit S5.

38.   He confirmed the extent of Mr Saini’s injuries, including the injuries to his hands, shoulders, and skin, mean that he does not expect Mr Saini to ever regain full range of motion in his neck.

39.   Professor Maitz stated that with respect to Mr Saini’s diminished breathing ability, he had reached maximum medical improvement.

40.   Professor Maitz said that Mr Saini has been a very motivated patient over the last 4 to 5 years.

Medical Report – Dr Anthony Clifford

41.   A medical report was also tendered on the sentence proceedings and became exhibit S6, which also confirms the injuries sustained by the victim but also the permanency of those.

Psychologist's Report by Dr Susan Pulman

42.   A psychologist's report was tendered on sentence and became exhibit S7.

43.   Dr Pulman details the psychological injuries suffered by Mr Saini. She sets out on page 3 that there is a strong stigmatisation of burn survivors, that subjects them – in general terms – to a variety of often overt dehumanising behaviours, including staring, startled reaction, double takes, whispering, teasing, and bullying, or other subtle reactions such as avoiding eye contact, ignoring, and pity.

44.   Dr Pulman also said that Mr Saini presents with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.

45.   Overall, Dr Pulman said that based on her interview of the victim, and the review of medical documentation, that there is evidence of substantial physical, psychological, emotional and financial harm to Mr Saini.

Victim Impact Statement

46.   A Victim Impact Statement by Mr Saini was tendered on the sentence proceedings, which became exhibit S4. Mr Saini was present at the sentencing proceedings, however did not wish to read out his Statement in Court.

47.   The injuries sustained by Mr Saini were outlined above. Further, as Mr Saini gave lengthy evidence during the trial, I was able to observe to some extent the physical injuries suffered by him and continuing discomfort caused by this offence.

48.   In addition to his physical injuries, his Victim Impact Statement sets out the psychological and emotional impact of his physical injuries. That includes that due to the injury to his vocal cord, when he talks to other people, they do not understand him and he feels very ashamed as a result. Mr Saini said he has to repeat things more than once. Further, if he needs to call out to somebody else in the same room as him, he either has to walk to that person, or sometimes he hits the table or wall so that he can get their attention. He said, and I accept from my observations of him, that it is very hard for him to stand up because his knees and arms are not strong enough, and he is unable to place weight on his hands.

49.   As outlined above, his skin gets very itchy. He said he is unable to use his hands to scratch his back, so sometimes needs to use doors or brick walls, despite bleeding from his sores. Further, he says that the bone infection in his thumbs has meant that he cannot button his shirts or zip his pants, and he has been told by his treating doctor that his thumbs may need to be amputated.

50.   Upon his discharge from hospital, Mr Saini said that when he came home, he needed his friends and family to feed him, and clean him after he used the toilet. This continued for a period of one and a half to two years. He said that this inability to care for himself made him feel as though he had no hands, and very shameful, angry and helpless, particularly when he needed to ask his daughter to clean him.

51.   Mr Saini said he needs to use both hands to pick up things, such as a cup of water.

52.   He is unable to wear a turban, despite it being a religious requirement.

53.   It appears from Mr Saini’s Victim Impact Statement that he may need to consider surgery on his vocal cords and a tracheotomy may be necessary. He has been meeting all the costs of his treatment to date.

54.   Further, since the incident, Mr Saini is unable to work. Prior to the incident, he was working as a taxi driver, working 14 or 15 hours a day. He said that before the incident, he was fit and used to manage his own funds. However, he is ashamed because now, he is dependent upon receiving the pension.

55.   Mr Saini has suffered significant psychological harm, including that he has nightmares of him being set on fire, then somebody putting water on his body, and his skin peeling off. He said that he always worries, and that he is very paranoid about his security in his home.

56.   Mr Saini says in his Statement that after the incident and whilst he was in hospital, he would have been better off if he had died, rather than being in constant pain. He said he contemplated suicide many times.

57.   Mr Saini said that he now has nothing to do, and that he has no social or sex life, as he is not capable of any intimacy.

Evidence on sentencing proceedings

58.   The offender did not give evidence either on the sentencing proceedings, or in the trial. In the circumstances there is nothing which can be taken into account in any way by way of remorse or contrition on the part of the offender.

Personal circumstances

59.   The offender is aged 39 (DOB 11 April 1976). He was 34 at the time of the offence. He was born in Fiji to Fijian/Indian parents. His family situation was stable, both emotionally and financially. He lived in Fiji until he was 10 when his family migrated to Auckland, New Zealand.

60.   He completed year 12 in high school. He has completed a Diploma in Information Technology. Following this, he worked in IT for about two years from age 23 to 25, he then worked as a technician in a vacuum store for a year before obtaining work as a truck driver. After immigrating to Australia in March 2004, the offender reported that he worked regularly as a truck driver over the next seven years until he moved back to New Zealand in 2011, where he continued to work as a truck driver until his arrest in November 2012.

61.   He is a clearly intelligent and thoughtful individual. His planning and premeditation about this offence should be seen in that regard.

Pre-Sentence Report

62.   There is no Pre-Sentence Report as none was sought by defence counsel.

Psychologist’s Report/evidence

63.   A report was tendered from Michelle Player, dated 3 September 2015 which provides as follows.

64.   The offender told the report writer that he had difficulties adjusting after his relocation at age 10 to Auckland. The offender’s father then commenced drinking alcohol problematically, with his brother. He told Ms Player that his father’s alcohol abuse caused marital discord between his parents, and that he was privy to alcohol-fuelled conflicts between his parents. Eventually their marriage broke down when the offender was 18 years old, which left the offender “devastated”.

65.   The offender’s father died in 2002 from liver failure as a consequence of his alcohol abuse. He described to the report writer that he experienced a prolonged grief reaction to this, however that appears to now be resolved.

66.   The offender met his first wife when he was 20 years old, and they married a year later when she fell pregnant. He has two daughters to his first wife, now aged 18 and 15.

67.   He told the report writer that his work as a truck driver led to frequent periods away from the family, as well as long hours, and that this was detrimental to his marriage. He also told the writer that his wife announced in 2008 that she was homesick for New Zealand, that she no longer loved him, and that she intended to return to New Zealand with their two daughters to be closer to her family. The offender told the report writer that he did not cope well with his wife and daughters’ departure at the end of 2008. However, from that stage up until presumably his arrest, he was providing financial assistance for his daughters.

68.   The offender met Ms Mohini Sharma, his current partner, at the beginning of 2009 through family members. He described to the report writer this relationship as being positive and supportive, and denied any prior substantial relationship difficulties, periods of separation or domestic violence. He described Ms Sharma as being “always loving and caring” and that “she liked my kids, the kids loved her”, as Ms Sharma was, together with the offender, having regular contact with his daughters in New Zealand.

69.   The offender affirmed that Ms Sharma remains supportive of him and visits him on a weekly basis in custody.

Drug use

70.   Following his first wife and daughters’ departure to New Zealand in late 2008, the offender told the report writer that he engaged in heavy alcohol use on his day off, and also in smoking methamphetamine (‘ice’) several times a week. He told the writer that his ice usage was, in part, a response to his marriage breakdown and, in part, a method to work longer hours and stay alert as a truck driver.

71.   He told the report writer that he was using ice five days a week within two months of first use and he estimated that he was spending a significant portion (some $300) of his wages to fund his drug use.

72.   He ceased using ice upon his return to New Zealand with Ms Sharma in January 2011. From that time, he told the report writer that he was not using any ice, but was still consuming large amounts of alcohol after work and over the weekend. He told the report writer that stressors such as his mother’s ill health contributed to his alcohol use, and that it had become habitual for him, and he struggled to alter this routine. He said that he was still drinking alcohol to excess every day up to the time of his arrest in November 2012. He told the report writer that he has been drug- and alcohol-free since being in custody.

73.   There is no evidence, and it is not submitted by counsel, that the offender was affected by alcohol at the time of the incident.

74.   The report writer did not report ever being diagnosed with a mental health problem, or having ever been prescribed any psychotropic medication, or having any contact with mental health professionals, including school counsellors. He did not report any prior self-harm history or current suicidal ideation.

75.   He also denied having any anger issues as a child or as an adult. He said to the report writer, “I hardly get angry”. He said that on previous occasions when he felt angry, he said “I don’t show it to anyone”, and denied exhibiting aggressive behaviour.

76.   The report writer said that based on the offender’s self-report, the offender does not reveal concerns with regards to anger management and aggression.

Correctional history

77.   The report writer stated that the offender’s mood was stable, albeit lower than usual, and that overall, he was coping as well as can be expected given his being in custody. Further, the offender’s case notes from the Department of Corrective Services (exhibit S3) indicate that he has been settled and compliant within the custodial setting, and there are no records of aggression or mental health concerns.

78.   That (Corrective Services) Report shows that the offender has been using his time in custody to obtain further education accreditations in computing, and his employment has been excellent, with him being given positions of responsibility and trust by custodial officers, such as working in restricted areas.

79.   The offender told the psychologist, Ms Michelle Player, that his partner’s cousin may be able to assist him with securing employment upon release. He also said that he will have stable accommodation with his partner, Ms Sharma, upon his release from jail.

80.   The report states that the offender has overall good psychosocial functioning, and does not exhibit any mental health vulnerability or any prior criminal offending. Further, he did not endorse aggression or violence. In terms of personal deterrence, it needs to be clearly stated that this form of violent assault, namely, the spraying of accelerant over the victim, Mr Saini, and using a cigarette lighter to set him alight, is a form of violence of the most heinous form.

Remorse / contrition

81.   The offender continues to deny his involvement in the events relating to this offence. He maintained his stance in this regard when speaking to the report writer, and said that he was not involved in perpetrating this violent offence against the victim.

Prospects of rehabilitation

82.   Notwithstanding the absence of any evidence of remorse, defence counsel relies on Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 and submits that it remains open to the Court to find that there are good prospects of rehabilitation, and that it should so find. Counsel relies on exhibit S 11, the Case Note Report from the Department of Corrective Services which outlines the offender’s employment whilst in custody, and submits that these reflect his capacity to successfully work in positions of trust, as well as undertaking further education, as outlined in that Report.

83.   In addition, Ms Player states in her psychologist’s report that jail is unlikely to impact upon the offender’s recidivism risk, but rather will expose him to the more antisocial and violent influences of jail, in addition to prolonging his social isolation and increasing his feelings of helplessness in relation to assisting his various family members, including his mother who needs substantial financial assistance.

Authorities

84.   Authorities shown on the public defenders website for offences of this nature, which are relevant include Park v R [2010] NSWCCA 151; R v VAA [2006] NSWCCA 44; Arun v R [2010] NSWCCA 214, although each of those cases were brought pursuant to ss 30, 33, and 47 respectively.

85.   Park v R was a sentence on a charge brought under section 30 where the maximum penalty was 25 years, with a standard non parole period of 10 years. However, here the charge on which the offender has been convicted is brought under s 46 of the Crimes Act, which, similarly, has a maximum penalty of 25 years but with no standard non parole period. In that case, the Court said that the sentence there imposed was a high sentence. However, this case involved an actual burning of the person while that case did not.

JIRS statistics

86.   The statistics for an offence under s 46 are very limited and of little guidance as they are taken from a pool of 4 cases. As is usual, there is no indication of the facts of those cases, nor of the personal circumstances of those offenders.

Consideration

87.   Here, what was involved was a planned and premeditated attack by the offender on Mr Saini in Mr Saini’s home. It was not an opportunistic attack but rather involved the offender establishing a pretext of coming to Mr Saini’s home with a box of chocolates on Christmas Eve, following which the offender was invited into Mr Saini’s premises. At that time, Mr Saini thought from the way the offender was acting that they were friends – see transcript Q/A 7374 and following. He said the offender was smiling when he came into his house and behaved in a way that did nothing to arouse Mr Saini’s suspicion as to the violence which would follow.

88.   The offender then went out to his car and returned with a cylinder containing petrol which he poured over Mr Saini and then ignited it.

89.   As far as he knew there was nobody else available to come to Mr Saini’s assistance let alone to help him extinguish the flames. It was only the facts that the 11-year-old JB (""Ms JB"") was able to call 000 and follow the instructions to put Mr Saini in a shower, and that an ambulance was available immediately which meant that Mr Saini’s injuries were not exacerbated. There was no remorse expressed, let alone any regard for the welfare of the victim.

90.   I emphasise that I have not placed any weight on the potential for the injuries to have been worse in assessing criminality or as an aggravating factor: R v Heron [2006] NSWCCA 215.

Particular charge

91.   In this case, the offender was charged and convicted of the alternative charge under s 46 and not of an offence under s 33. The primary, more serious charge on the Indictment, of which the offender was acquitted, was brought pursuant to s 27, namely, causing grievous bodily harm to the victim with intent to kill him. Each of ss 27, 33 and 46 carry the same maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment, however they differ in terms of their prescribed standard non parole periods. This offence – under s 46 – does not have a prescribed standard non parole period, whereas ss 27 and 33 have a standard non parole period of 10 years and 7 years respectively. Defence counsel submits that by reason of this distinction, this offence should be considered as less serious than the offences under ss 27 and 33: Cassidy v R [2012] NSWCCA 68 at [26]. Each offence and its criminality must be looked at in the light of the elements, all the circumstances and in terms of the maximum penalty established.

92.   However I do need to take into account the objectives of sentencing as set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which includes in s 3 the element of retribution. There are clear policy implications where the courts need to be concerned to ensure that the punishment embodies an element of retribution to ensure that people and their wider family or community groups do not take it upon themselves to exercise retribution.

Psychological injuries: Report by Dr Pulman

93.   His understandable depression is set out in the medical documentation, namely the Report by Dr Susan Pulman, and corroborated in his victim impact statement. He said during the trial that he was petrified by the events that had taken place.

94.   I observed him throughout the trial, particularly when he was giving evidence, and in my view, neither his evidence nor presentation was feigned nor manipulated. He was unable to give evidence for more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time nor to sit still for long periods.

95.   Defence counsel submits that the court is only able to have regard to the consequences of an offence that was intended or could have reasonably been foreseen. In this regard, counsel relies on Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41 at [4], [28] – [39] and the relevant cases cited therein. Although I accept the jury’s finding that the offender did not intend to kill Mr Saini, I do not accept the submission that the actual harm suffered by Mr Saini was not foreseeable by the offender in acting the way that he did, in particular, the burns and injuries suffered by him.

96.   Normally in such cases, I am unable to take into account the fact that the offence involved an infliction of injury, as it is a necessary element of a charge under s 46. However, to the extent that the injury inflicted significantly exceeds the minimum injury necessary to qualify as grievous bodily harm, it may relevantly be considered as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g): R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19. Here, it is clearly the case that the injuries suffered by Mr Saini at the time of the offence, then, as I observed, some 5 years later, at trial, and his ongoing medical issues, justify such a finding of aggravation. The impact on him has been dramatic – as set out in his Victim Impact Statement.

Public safety: Danger to others

97.   While there was nobody else in the kitchen where the incident took place, there were other people in the house including an 11-year-old girl Ms JB and Mr Saini’s elderly mother, Ms Parsin Kaur.

98.   The fire which the offender ignited although primarily directed to Mr Saini’s person took place in a confined space in a house with wooden exposed floors and where there were clearly wooden walls in the lounge area as shown in the photographs. There are clear public safety implications when a person is sprayed with petrol or similar accelerant in such confined spaces and where there is exposed timber work.

99.   When the police attended the premises there was a smell of petrol and parts of burnt clothing as well as ash and fire marks at various parts of the house, on the floor and in the backyard of the home. The synthetic T-shirt being worn by Mr Saini was incinerated and reduced to a charred piece of the collar and a small section of rag.

100.   There are clear public safety implications with any such act which must be apparent to those carrying them out, particularly in a residential home. A person who has been ignited with petrol is likely to become completely irrational and to run to an area where he may seek to have the flames doused.

101.   In those circumstances there were clear implications for public safety to any other persons present in those premises.

Other aggravating features

102.   The offence was committed in the vicinity of Ms JB who, at the time of the offence, was aged 11 years. Fortunately, Ms JB was not in the kitchen at the time the offender poured petrol over and ignited Mr Saini’s clothes. However, she was only a few metres away from them, inside the house. It is unclear whether the offender was aware of Ms JB’s presence inside the house. However it is clear from her evidence that she saw the offender, and that the offender had no regard as to the possibility of a child being present.

103.   It was a planned and premeditated attack. The offender had obtained a gas bottle/cylinder which he had stored in his car. It is clear that his intentions were sinister, and the apparently friendly gesture of bringing with him a box of chocolates was duplicitous, and merely to feign a pretence of friendship with the victim, and presumably to gain entry into the house.

Findings as to the nature of the criminality involved

104.   Here, the circumstances of this offence involving, as it does, clear planning and premeditation, and the clear intention to “send a message” means that the offence is of a very high order of criminality. Indeed it is hard to see why this offence would not attract a finding of being in or just below the worst case of criminality.

105.   Additionally, the offence was committed in the victim’s home. I am aware that the authorities are unresolved in this regard, namely whether the fact that the offender was invited into the home by the victim is or is not precluded as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(eb) – see Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [111] – [112] then the recent case of Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123 per Wilson J at [45] – [64]; Hoeben CJ and Hulme J reserved their decisions on that aspect. Here, the invitation was secured by a false pretence or planned deceit by the offender.

106.   The offender was a guest and was readily invited into the victim’s home. That involves an element of trust. The offender had met the victim on several prior occasions, and the victim, despite being warned by Ms Sharma, extended his hospitality to the offender.

107.   Here, the offender intended to use the petrol/accelerant and to ignite it. An inevitable consequence was the grievous bodily harm caused.

108.   Burning a victim is an act of immediate, destructive, and horrifically painful violence. It must be denounced in the strongest possible terms. I note that whilst I consider this to be a particularly heinous type of violence, I have taken care not to consider this as an aggravating factor of the crime, given that it falls within the elements of an offence under s 46 of the Crimes Act.

109.   In light of the current tensions as outlined above, and without treating these factors as aggravating features given the elements of the offence, they are still matters that bear upon a proper assessment of the objective criminality of this offence.

110.   The offender also sprayed or poured petrol on the clothing covering the upper part of the victim’s front body, where vital organs are located.

111.   One factor that distinguishes this offence from what would be the worst case is that there was no gratuitous cruelty or injury inflicted beyond what was caused by the primary act of pouring petrol over the victim and igniting his clothing.

112.   I also find that there is also an absence of any mitigating factors, other than that the offender had no prior criminal history prior to committing this offence.

113.   I have considered the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kendall v R [2015] NSWCCA 13; R v Twala (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 November 1994); and Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] per Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed). Further, Little v R [2010] NSWCCA 210 at [31] per Hall J (with whom McFarlan JA and Simpson J agreed) where it was held that the physical injury and impairment, disability and emotional and psychological consequences of the offence upon the victim are all considerations important to an assessment of objective criminality.

114.   I have considered the relevant authorities in assessing the criminality of this offence when compared with the worst possible case. I do consider that this case was near to the worst category of such cases given several factors of heinousness, including the planning and premeditation; the nature of injuries to the victim; leaving the victim in a burning state; the false pretences upon which the offender was invited into the home by the victim, which involved bringing a box of chocolates, having the victim make a cup of coffee for him; and the offender’s immediate departure from the scene. 

General deterrence

116.   In the circumstances of all the evidence and the matters set out, a penalty must be imposed which properly reflects the principles of general deterrence.

117.   Here, I need to consider that the events occurred in the victim’s own home, and whether that is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This was considered in Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123 at [66] in the following terms:

“Although there was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant attended the complainant’s home for a spurious purpose – that is, to call upon family members whom he knew to have already left the house, it may be accepted for present purposes that the applicant was initially a guest in the complainant’s home, and lawfully inside the premises. His status changed however, from the moment the complainant told him to leave the premises, that being prior to the commission of the offences.”

118.   There are substantial factual differences that distinguish that case from this, namely, that in this case, the invitation to the offender by the complainant was not at any stage withdrawn. However, that invitation may not have been extended to the offender quickly going back to his car and returning to the house with a bottle containing the accelerant. It is unlikely that that invitation would have continued, had the victim seen or known that the offender was bringing the accelerant back into the home.

119.   In my view, what permission was there at the initial stages, was clearly no longer relevant when the offender returned with the inflammable liquid. It is also clearly relevant that the offender obtained admission essentially by a trick or subterfuge using the box of chocolates as an ostensible gift.

120.   Both those factors should be reflected in the total sentence to be imposed from the point of view of both general and specific deterrence.

Personal deterrence

121.   Here the offender has no prior convictions. He has no blemishes on his custodial record in the 2 ½ years he has been in custody.

122.   Further, defence counsel submits that the offender did not commit any further offences between the time of the offence and his arrest in New Zealand.

Special circumstances

123.   This has been the offender’s first time in custody. He is fluent in English and there is no evidence of any existing hardship to him over and above what could be expected for any offender in custody. He is aged 39. There is no expression of remorse or contrition. Absent that, it is difficult to see how he will benefit from any extended period on probation.

124.   Defence counsel relies on the psychologist’s report in this regard, namely that the offender will benefit from drug and alcohol rehabilitation once he is released into the community. Counsel submits accordingly that the offender will benefit from a longer period of supervision and monitoring by Community Corrections (Probation and Parole) Service. As I outlined previously, there is no evidence that the offence was committed whilst the offender was under the influence of any alcohol or drug. I do not consider the actions or criminality of this offence to be an extension of his drug and alcohol abuse.

125.   Defence counsel also submits that the offender should be the subject of special circumstances because he is more likely to suffer additional hardship and isolation in custody as his mother and his two children live in New Zealand.

126.   There will be additional hardship and isolation by reason of his immediate family being overseas, and the consequent loss of contact with his mother and children. However in that regard, he is visited on a once weekly basis by Ms Sharma. Given those factors and the assessment by the psychologist’s report writer, Ms Player, that he will benefit from drug and alcohol counselling in the community, I will find special circumstances to a limited extent only and vary the statutory ratio to one of 70% of the head sentence.

Sentencing options

127.   Here, the requirements of general deterrence in particular are such that no other sentencing option – for example, a suspended sentence or an intensive corrections order, is appropriate.

Commencement date

128.   The offender has been in custody since 1 December 2012. That incarceration has been solely due to this offence. He has no other prior convictions. It is appropriate that the sentence should be backdated to commence on and from that date.

Sentence

1.   The offender is sentenced to a period of 16 years imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 11 years and 3 months backdated to commence on 1 December 2012 and expiring on 29 February 2024 with an additional term of 4 years and 9 months expiring on 30 November 2028.

2.   That reflects my finding of special circumstances of 70%.

Parole

3.   I recommend that when the offender is released on parole that he be subject to the following conditions: –

a)   Whatever supervision is deemed necessary by Community Corrections (Probation and Parole) Service;

b)   The offender inform the Community Corrections service of any address at which he is living and any change of address not less than seven days before such change occurs; and

c)   The offender comply with any treatment program organised in relation to his usage of methamphetamine or any other prohibited substance.

		22 October 2015",2015-09-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702772,Robertson v R [2015] NSWCCA 251,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 15 October 2014 the applicant, Darren Stewart Robertson, was sentenced in the Supreme Court to 10 years and 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years for the offence of manslaughter. The circumstances of the offending are sufficiently set out in the judgment of the sentencing judge, Harrison J, in R v Robertson; R v McArthur.  [1] 
	
	
	On 1 May 2015 (six months after the sentence was imposed) a notice of application for leave to appeal was filed stating a single ground, namely, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The applicant's submissions in support of the application were also filed on 1 May 2015.
	
	
	On 7 September 2015 an amended notice was filed adding as a second ground error on the part of the sentencing judge “in taking into account as an aggravating circumstance that the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence.”
	


Factual background


	
	The father of the deceased owned and operated an automotive business in Minchinbury. The offenders, Robertson and McArthur, drove from the Central Coast to Minchinbury on the morning of 5 December 2011, arriving in the vicinity of the business at about 5.40am. The deceased and his father arrived about two hours later at 7.50am. After opening the business the father drove away leaving the deceased alone in the workshop.
	
	
	At about 8.13am McArthur got out of the car, walked into the factory complex in which the business was located and assaulted the deceased with a knife. The direct cause of death was a stab wound to the chest which penetrated the left lung and thoracic aorta.
	
	
	The trip from the Central Coast to Minchinbury was undertaken in a car owned by the applicant's partner, Ms James. The statement of agreed facts included the following conversation between the applicant and the offender on the day before the killing:
	


“OFFENDER: I have been offered to do a job tomorrow for a mate for good money.

MS JAMES: What sort of job?

OFFENDER: All I have to do is go to Minchinbury to rough up and scare some bloke that owed some money to a friend and has ripped off some people.

MS JAMES: What the hell? No way. Don't be stupid. Where did all this come from? Who is this friend?

OFFENDER: Nobody. Don't worry about it. I can get $2500 for doing it. It will be fine. I have been down there and scoped it all out. He's a big bastard but I won't be alone. It's in an industrial area in a shed up the back of Minchinbury.”

The offender disputes that he said he could get $2,500.”


	
	The final paragraph of the statement read as follows:
	


“The offender was part of a joint enterprise involving an unlawful and dangerous act, namely, to rough up or assault [the father] for payment. In doing so the offender was aware that he was exposing another person to an appreciable risk of really serious injury.”


	
	The statement of agreed facts was dated 8 July 2014. That was the first day of the proposed trial at which the Prosecutor accepted a plea of guilty for manslaughter in full satisfaction of an indictment alleging murder.
	
	
	There were other matters set out in the agreed facts, the significance of some of which was obscure. Thus the penultimate paragraph was in the following terms:
	


“In the days following the offence the offender told Ms James that he had organised for MCARTHUR to do the job with him and that a person by the name of ‘Macca’ was to pay the offender for the ‘job’.

The offender disputes that he organised MCARTHUR to do the job.”


	
	There was no dispute that McArthur had done the job. There appears to have been no dispute that the offender told his partner that he had organised McArthur to do the job and that he was to be paid. The qualification appears to suggest a dispute as to him in fact being the organiser. This was only one of the factual obscurities facing the sentencing judge. The second was the qualification as to what he said to Ms James, namely, that he could get $2,500, there being no dispute that he told her after the event that he would be paid for the job. The third curiosity is that in the conversation with Ms James before the event he described the person to be roughed up as a big bastard which in the circumstances seems unlikely to be the 15 year old son. Nevertheless, it was an agreed fact that the father drove away before the event occurred.
	
	
	No oral evidence was called on behalf of the applicant on the sentence hearing. His counsel, however, tendered a report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 24 August 2014. [2]  As the judge noted in considering the objective seriousness of the criminal enterprise the applicant's account of what occurred given to Dr Nielssen was “somewhat difficult to reconcile with what was otherwise agreed or established.” [3]  Even assuming that the references in the report to “Mr McAndrew” were mistaken and the intended references were to “Mr McArthur”, there were other discrepancies. Importantly, and without challenge, the judge noted that “Mr Robertson did not express any remorse in his interview with Dr Nielssen and did not do so in evidence before me.” [4]  (He did not express remorse in evidence because he did not give evidence.)
	
	
	The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the plea. It follows that the starting point for the sentence was, in round terms, 12 years 6 months.
	


Grounds of appeal

(a)   ground 2 – aggravating circumstances


	
	In a carefully structured judgment on sentence various topics were discussed under specific headings. Two headings involved “Mitigating factors” and “Aggravating circumstances”. Under the latter heading appeared the following statement: [5] 
	


“The offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence. Even though the offence also involved the actual use of a weapon there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Robertson was aware of this and so this factor does not aggravate his offence. The offence was also part of an organised criminal activity.”


	
	Precisely what the sentencing judge had in mind in this passage is unclear. A threat or use of violence is identified as an “aggravating factor” in s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). However, as s 21A(2) states, an element of an offence (or what may be described as an inherent characteristic of an offence [6] ) of the kind for which sentence is being passed should not be treated as an aggravating factor; that is because of the risk of double counting. There is no doubt that actual violence is often an element of the offence of manslaughter, but that is not always so.
	
	
	What the judge may have had in mind was that, because the applicant was not the perpetrator of the violent attack, but stayed in the car, the objective seriousness of his offending depended in part upon what he knew or might have expected to take place. Thus, in the next sentence, the judge went on to note that the evidence did not establish that the applicant was aware that McArthur was carrying a weapon. That was consistent with the facts outlined at an earlier point in the judgment. [7]  The passage may be understood as identifying a potential aggravating factor which is then dismissed.
	
	
	It is also possible, as the respondent contended, that the comments reflected the fact that not every offence of manslaughter involves a threat or use of violence. In that sense it would be legitimate to take into account that this was not manslaughter by criminal negligence but a case involving intentional harm. That is a legitimate alternative reading of the passage.
	
	
	Whichever reading is correct, it is not possible to infer that the judge engaged in some impermissible form of double counting so as to increase the sentence by taking one factor into account twice. Further, there is no challenge to the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence as falling in the mid range for offences of this type. [8]  Ground 2 should be rejected.
	


(b)   ground 1 - sentence manifestly excessive


	
	The submissions for the applicant were appropriately cautious as to the use which could be made of sentencing statistics and comparable cases in relation to a crime which, apart from the element of death, can involve a wide range of offending. In her written submissions, senior counsel identified three cases which had some significant degree of similarity to the present case. These were Barnes v R [9]  (7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years); Shedden v R [10]  (9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months) and Ibrahim v R [11]  (sentence of 9 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months). Each case was said to involve higher culpability than the present. Thus, in Barnes, it was said that the offender was aware that his co-offender had a weapon and, further, the offender had a criminal history and was on parole at the time of the offence. In Shedden, although the sentence involved a discount of 25% (giving a starting point of 12 years) again the offender knew that one person had a gun, although he did not know whether it was loaded. In Ibrahim, the offender knew that a co-offender had a knife and the offender himself was actively involved in the assault.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the sentence in each of these cases was lower than that imposed on the applicant. It may also be accepted that there were elements of culpability which were greater than the findings with respect to the applicant. On the other hand, there were disparities in the findings with respect to subjective circumstances and with respect to remorse. In addition, the age of the offender is a point of variation. In the cases relied on, so far as the submissions revealed, all the offenders were between 18 and 29 years of age. The applicant was significantly older, being over 40 years at the date of the offence.
	
	
	There were other cases referred to (contained in a schedule) most, but not all, of which involved shorter sentences. The appropriate inference is that the range of sentences properly available for an offence of manslaughter is wider than with respect to some other offences and the mere fact that a sentence, on one view, is at or near the top of an apparent range, does not mean that it was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In this context, counsel for the applicant relied on observations in two recent decisions of the High Court. In the first, Hili v The Queen, [12]  there is discussion of what can be made of comparable cases in dealing with an appropriate sentence. The joint reasons referred with approval to the statement of Simpson J in De La Rosa [13]  that, while there may be doubt as to the value in stating a range, comparable cases can “stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence.” [14]  In the second, Barbaro v The Queen, [15]  the joint reasons [16]  cast doubt on the usefulness of the phrase ""available range"" [17]  as a means of describing the limits outside which a sentence might involve manifest excess or manifest inadequacy.
	
	
	These statements, read in context, explain why a prosecutor may take the Court to comparable cases but why it may be unhelpful, even erroneous, to simply identify an available range. In particular, the comments in Barbaro should not be taken out of their context. They were made in circumstances where the Court was considering the practice in Victoria of the trial judge requiring prosecutors to identify an available range for sentencing. [18]  It is not necessary, for present purposes, to identify the implications of the reasons in that case for prosecutors in relation to State offences.
	
	
	There are two arguably relevant lessons to be drawn from these passages. One is that there may be a degree of circularity, or perhaps merely the restating of a conclusion, in saying that a sentence is manifestly excessive because it falls outside the available range; in other words, there is no difference in the two ideas. Secondly and more significantly, it is necessary to identify the limits of the sentencing Court's discretion, by reference to the particular circumstances of the case under review.
	
	
	Those conclusions do not assist the applicant in the present case. He was entitled to rely upon the material which was available from comparable cases, though the extent to which they provided assistance in the particular circumstances of this case was perhaps more limited than the submissions suggested.
	
	
	The respondent suggested that it was inappropriate for counsel for the applicant to seek to establish a range by reference to comparable cases which had not been provided to the trial judge. Reliance was placed on the reasoning of Johnson J in Zreika v The Queen, [19]  with respect to the limitations which should be imposed on submissions made on a sentencing appeal:
	


“The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made.”


	
	It is sufficient for present purposes to say that the passage in Zreika should not be read as precluding reference to comparable cases not relied on before the sentencing judge. What was said about an appeal not being a rehearing of a plea of mitigation, raising arguments or issues which had not been ventilated before the sentencing judge, are somewhat different and more limited propositions. In the present case, there is no doubt that it was appropriate for this Court to have regard to the comparable cases upon which the applicant sought to place reliance. Again, what is required is an assessment of the particular circumstances of the individual case, having regard to all the relevant considerations, including objective seriousness of the offending, the subjective circumstances of the offender and similar matters.
	
	
	The agreed facts indicated that the applicant had undertaken a degree of planning, including an earlier visit to the location of the offending and to obtain the involvement of a third person, whom he had driven to the scene. The attempt by his former girlfriend to dissuade him from the activity had fallen on deaf ears. Those matters, combined with a lack of evidence of remorse after the event, required, as the sentencing judge accepted, a significant sentence to reflect elements of general deterrence and disapprobation of the community with respect to such conduct.
	
	
	In my view, while there was sufficient to be said to warrant a grant of leave to appeal, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal.

(2)   Dismiss the appeal


	
	ADAMS J: I agree.
	
	
	R A HULME J: The error for which the applicant contended under ground 2 was of a type which was encountered with unfortunate frequency in the years immediately following the amendment of section 21A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act in 2003. [20] 
	
	
	The care which is required to avoid the type of error referred to in the judgment of Basten JA (at [17]) is now so well-known that I would be slow to infer error by an experienced judge where there is any ambiguity.
	
	
	What ground 2 is concerned with is a single sentence in a relatively lengthy sentence judgment. It concerned a matter that could only be regarded as relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. There was no challenge to the conclusion of the primary judge as to the objective seriousness of the offence (and nor could there be, in my respectful view). This fortifies, in my mind, the conclusion that his Honour did not err in the manner for which the applicant contended.
	
	
	Another matter of note, brought to attention today by counsel for the Crown, is that there were signs of violence having been perpetrated upon the deceased over and above the stabbing, which was the act causing death. These were referred to in the judgment of the primary judge at [10]. This means that there was some violence that exceeded that which was necessary for the commission of the offence.
	
	
	With those additional observations, I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA, for the reasons he has provided.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the reasons of Button J and with the orders he proposes.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Charteris on 3 April 2014 in the District Court at Moree. The aggregate sentence pertained to two offences of breaking entering and stealing in circumstances of aggravation, those circumstances being the fact that the applicant was in the company of another person. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years (pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), and a standard non-parole period of five years (pursuant to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)).
	


Objective features


	
	The first offence in time (although it was sequence two) was committed in the evening of 23 May 2012. The applicant broke and entered a funeral home in Moree. A co-offender was present. The applicant tried to smash through a glass panel in the front door of the premises with a rock, but failed. Thereafter he kicked his way into the building through the front door and a security grille. The applicant and his co-offender carried away a flat screen television and a stereo system between the two of them. Both items were later sold for cash.
	
	
	The second offence in time (although it was sequence one) was committed in the afternoon of 24 May 2012. The applicant attended at residential premises, and noted that there was no car in the driveway. He departed, obtained the assistance of the co-offender, and they returned to the home. Between the two of them, they removed a number of timber panels from the structure of the house. The co-offender climbed through the hole that was created, and passed a number of items out to the applicant. They included a flat screen television, a laptop, a computer gaming console, a welder, a rattle gun, a cordless drill, and a socket set. Those items were secreted nearby, and the two men departed. Later, all of the stolen property was sold for cash.
	
	
	Taken into account on sentence with regard to the offence committed upon the residential premises was a Form 1, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It contained five charges. Again, all offences were committed in the township of Moree. All offences were expressed in the document to be pending before the Local Court in the same town.
	
	
	The first offence was a larceny that occurred on 17 April 2012. The maximum penalty for that offence on indictment is imprisonment for five years (s 117 of the Crimes Act), and, when dealt with summarily, imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	In short, the applicant attended a freight distribution depot in search of prescription drugs that are open to abuse. He was disturbed by staff, and ended up running away, taking with him nothing more than a box containing medication for diabetes.
	
	
	The second offence was a break, enter and steal that occurred on or about 8 May 2012. The maximum penalty for that offence on indictment is imprisonment for 14 years (s 109 of the Crimes Act), and, when dealt with summarily, imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	The applicant gained entry to a second story residential unit by way of an adjacent balcony and a window that he was able to open. He stole two digital cameras, two bottles of liquor, and a sum of money. He subsequently sold one of the cameras for about $150.
	
	
	The third offence was a break, enter and steal committed on 14 August 2012. The applicant broke into a private home by forcing open a sliding front window. He departed with a plasma screen television, which he accidentally damaged in the process. He carried it a short distance further before destroying it deliberately. It was found in the rear yard of a neighbour.
	
	
	The fourth offence was also a break enter and steal, and was committed on 25 November 2012. The applicant observed that the female victim was away from her home, attending church. He went to her residence, and entered through the front door, which was closed but not locked. He removed $350 in cash from a purse and also took with him a mobile phone.
	
	
	I interpolate to say that that offence was committed in breach of bail that the applicant had entered on 8 October 2012.
	
	
	The fifth and final offence contained on the Form 1 was another break, enter and steal committed on 12 December 2012. Again, the target was a residential home. Finding it to be secured, the applicant forced a rear window open and gained entry. He found a laptop computer, a mobile phone, and a modem. He departed with those three items.
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the two substantive offences, and was accorded a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas. That discount is not impugned in this application.
	
	
	The applicant is an Aboriginal man. He was 36 years of age when he stood for sentence. Born in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool, he was raised in Campbelltown. One of five siblings, he left school in year eight at the age of 14. He had fallen in with the wrong crowd, and ended up being detained in a juvenile detention centre from an early stage. Although he possessed a talent for rugby league, it was not sufficient for him to make a career of it. He had done some work as a janitor and cleaner.
	
	
	The applicant had met the mother of his three children in Moree. Regrettably, both he and she have a long-standing problem with prohibited drugs, including heroin. Granted Supreme Court bail at one stage with regard to the charges under discussion, he had succeeded for a time, but returned to prohibited drugs in due course. He explained in evidence that all of the offences were “thieving”, committed in order to feed the habit of the applicant and his romantic partner.
	
	
	The criminal record of the applicant did not assist him. It commenced in 1991 when he was a juvenile. He was subject to control orders for offences against property and person, including attempted sexual assault and attempted robbery.
	
	
	As an adult he had been fined for assault and resisting arrest, and placed on a bond for breaching an apprehended domestic violence order. Almost 20 years ago, he was ordered to perform community service for breaking entering and stealing. In 2011 he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for stealing from the person. His criminal record featured offences of violence as an adult as well.
	
	
	To be weighed against those adverse aspects was the fact that a substantial proportion of his criminal record arose when he was a juvenile, and the fact that every previous offence committed as an adult had been prosecuted in the Local Court.
	
	
	By the time of the proceedings on sentence, the applicant, his partner, and two of their three children were all incarcerated or detained.
	
	
	As for the future, he gave evidence before his Honour that his plan was to find a job, earn money, and “just stay away from drugs”. In cross-examination, however, he stated that he did not regard himself as an addict; he blamed his problem on the fact that prohibited drugs have been freely available to him.
	
	
	Undoubtedly the most noteworthy subjective feature on sentence was that the applicant had voluntarily admitted all offences. He explained in evidence that he had been at court with regard to a charge that he was defending, and he had “just thought I’ll go over to the police with that, put myself in, before it even comes up or anything”. He gave evidence that he “just wanted a clean slate”. After that, he drove around the township with the police, pointing out the locations at which he had admitted he committed the offences. His Honour found that the applicant had not been a suspect when he took those steps.
	
	
	With regard to that conduct of the applicant, his Honour accorded a further discount of 15%: see generally R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 and s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, the aggregate sentence imposed, and indicative sentences underpinning it, need to be understood as reflecting a total discount of 40% from notional starting points.
	
	
	In the remarks on sentence, his Honour accepted that the applicant had some insight, and was trying to be frank in his evidence. His Honour accepted that the applicant regretted his conduct. Because of the ongoing relationship with the applicant’s partner, herself burdened by a serious problem with prohibited drugs, the optimism of his Honour did not extend far beyond those aspects.
	


Sentence structure


	
	As I have said, a single aggregate sentence was imposed, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	With regard to the offence committed against the funeral home on 23 May 2012, his Honour indicated (pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) a head sentence of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months, having found special circumstances.
	
	
	With regard to the offence second in time against the residential premises, which had the Form 1 attaching to it, his Honour indicated a head sentence of three years nine months with a non-parole period of half that; namely 22.5 months, or one year 10 months and two weeks.
	
	
	Ultimately, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years six months was imposed. That sentence commenced on 26 May 2014, in order to reflect a period during which the applicant was at liberty on bail. That backdate is not impugned in this application.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The following three grounds were notified and pressed:
	


1. His Honour erred in concluding that the criminality (objective seriousness) of both offences fell within the middle range.

2. His Honour erred in taking into account the Form 1 matters in assessing the criminality of Count 1 on the indictment.

3. Manifest excess.


	
	Ground one
	
	
	This ground was based upon the assessment of objective seriousness that his Honour made in the remarks on sentence at p 9. It was as follows:
	


It is submitted that the criminality is lower than the middle range but I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that these two offences find themselves in the middle range. They are break and enter offences, forcing entry into premises and stealing property. The broad range of offences that respond to this section includes, in my view, the two matters for which I have to impose sentence.


	
	In the same vein, his Honour also said at p 9, “as regards the criminality, I do find that these offences find themselves in the broad middle range of offences that respond to this section”.
	
	
	In short, it was submitted that the evaluative judgment that the two substantive matters fell within “the broad middle range of offences that respond to this section” was not open to his Honour. Reference was made to another decision of this Court in which, in the context of determining whether sentences were manifestly excessive, the evaluation of objective seriousness of another judge was impugned: see Mitchell Allan v R; Mitchell Paul v R; Mitchell Michael v R [2014] NSWCCA 212.
	
	
	I would reject this ground. It is soundly well established that the evaluation of objective seriousness is something very much vouchsafed to the sentencing judge: see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J agreed), referred to most recently in Browning v R [2015] NSWCCA 147 at [91] (Garling J, with whom Gleeson JA and Johnson J agreed).
	
	
	And in any event, even if one embarks upon a review of the evaluation of his Honour, I do not detect error in it. It is true that neither of the substantive offences was the most severe example of an aggravated break enter and steal that one can imagine. But nor were they patently trivial.
	
	
	The first offence featured determinedly breaking into secured commercial premises with a co-offender and stealing electronic items of considerable value, and thereafter selling them for cash.
	
	
	The second offence involved breaking into a residential home, and featured a degree of organisation. Again, quite valuable items were stolen with the assistance of a co-offender.
	
	
	To my mind, it was well open to his Honour to find that these offences fell within the “broad middle range of offences that respond to this section”.
	
	
	I would reject ground one.
	


Ground two 


	
	This ground was founded upon the things said by his Honour in the remarks on sentence about the effect of the Form 1 offences upon the substantive offence of 24 May 2012, with regard to which they were taken into account.
	
	
	The first thing said about that topic in the remarks on sentence was as follows: “The matters on the Form 1 must aggravate the penalty I impose in relation to sequence 1. Each of the individual offences was serious in its own right”.
	
	
	The second was as follows: “The aggravating matters are, of course, confined to sequence 1, which has the Form 1 matters to be taken into account”. 
	
	
	The third was as follows: “I do find that the Form 1 aggravates sequence 1 – that is the only aggravating matter of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt”.
	
	
	It was submitted, in short, that his Honour had misapplied the principles that apply when further offences are taken into account in sentencing by way of a Form 1. In particular, it was said that the guideline judgment makes it clear that, in those circumstances, one is sentencing only for the substantive offence; that sentences are not to be imposed notionally for the offences on the Form 1; that the Form 1 offences may be taken into account “with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence”; and that that is done by giving greater weight to personal deterrence and retribution: see Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 (the guideline judgment) at [42] (Spigelman CJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, as for the first reference that I have extracted above, although inexactly expressed, it was free from any effective error: when one is sentenced for a substantive offence that has a Form 1 attached to it, the ultimate sentence to be imposed is “aggravated” by the presence of the Form 1, in the way explained by the Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment.
	
	
	As for the second and third extracts, the Crown submitted that one available inference was that his Honour had simply misspoken, rather than misapplied principle.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, I accept the submissions of the Crown that, although infelicitously expressed, the first extract is not erroneous.
	
	
	As for the second extract, I accept the submission of the applicant that it is not correct to say that the substantive offence is “aggravated” by the presence of offences on a Form 1.
	
	
	The same may be said of the third extract: the offences on the Form 1 do not “aggravate” the substantive offence, although they do have an effect on the sentence ultimately imposed, in the way explained in the guideline judgment.
	
	
	I turn to consider whether those misstatements of principle establish a misapplication of principle.
	
	
	The proceedings on sentence occurred on 2 April 2014, and his Honour imposed sentence the following day. The District Court was sitting in a country town that no doubt had a busy list of trials and short matters. The transcript of the proceedings on sentence shows that the question of the correct approach to a Form 1 was the subject of no debate whatsoever; that is not surprising, because any controversy about the topic was settled by the guideline judgment well over 10 years ago.
	
	
	As I have said, the first reference to the Form 1 was correct, in a practical sense, though to the extent that it spoke of “aggravating” a sentence, it was perhaps infelicitous.
	
	
	As I have said, the second and third references were, in my respectful opinion, not correct.
	
	
	But having reflected on the matter, I do not accept that the sentencing judge was applying a wrong principle. Rather, I have come to believe that what was said in the second and third extracts was a combination of a slip in language and the use of a shorthand with regard to a very commonly encountered procedure and very well-established principles. That occurred in remarks on sentence delivered, if not extemporaneously, then shortly after the proceedings on sentence had concluded.
	
	
	In the result, despite the infelicity of language, I am not satisfied that the sentencing judge applied a wrong principle with regard to taking the Form 1 into account. For that reason, I would not uphold ground two.
	


Ground three


	
	This ground was founded upon consideration of the notional starting points that must have been adopted by his Honour. Although it is true that only the aggregate sentence can be the subject of appeal (see, for example, R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [32]), it is also true that discounts are to be applied by sentencing judges to the indicative sentences, and not to the ultimate aggregate sentence: see, for example, SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [42].
	
	
	It is also true, of course, as R A Hulme J (with whom Leeming JA and Price J agreed) very recently emphasised in Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225 at [32], that it is the sentence ultimately imposed that is under appeal, not the starting point. Nevertheless, in that context I do not think it inapposite to reflect upon the notional starting points of both the indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence (the latter as a way of generally testing the application of the principle of totality) as a guide to analysis, so long as one does so cautiously, and bears in mind that it is the aggregate sentence actually imposed that is the subject of the application for leave to appeal, nothing else.
	
	
	Removing for analysis the discount of 40% from the offence of 23 May 2012, it can be seen that there must have been a notional starting point of a head sentence of five years.
	
	
	Removing the discount from the offence second in time of 24 May 2012, which featured the Form 1, it can be seen that there must have been a notional starting point of a head sentence of imprisonment for six years three months.
	
	
	Completing my analysis with regard to the aggregate head sentence, the starting point without the discount of 40% must have been eight years four months.
	
	
	Those notional starting points immediately give one pause for thought. Could it be said that an aggregate head sentence that is derived from a starting point head sentence of over eight years was within the discretion of his Honour, even allowing for the filing of the Form 1 as well?
	
	
	In oral submissions before us, the Crown Prosecutor frankly conceded that the sentence, taking into account all objective and subjective features, and especially the substantial discount, could not be characterised as anything other than “towards the high side”. She did not seek to resist vigorously the proposition that, in the unusual circumstances of this matter, ground three may have some force.
	
	
	Turning to my view of this question, it is true that the criminal record of the applicant did not assist him. As I have said, it featured offences against property and person committed both as a juvenile and as an adult. It will be recalled that one of the Form 1 offences was committed on bail. It is also the case that, as I have said, neither of the substantive offences was trivial (nor indeed were the majority of the offences on the Form 1). It is to be remembered that the applicant was to be sentenced for two offences, not one, and that with regard to one of them considerations of personal deterrence and retribution were to be given extra weight by way of the presence of the offences on the Form 1. Finally, special circumstances were found that substantially reduced the aggregate non parole period actually imposed.
	
	
	All of that must be accepted. And it must also be accepted that, but for the discount that his Honour applied, neither the aggregate sentence nor the indicative sentences would have been in any way exceptionable.
	
	
	Nevertheless, whether one analyses the notional starting points of each of the indicative sentences, or the notional starting point of the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed, on reflection I have come to the view that the starting points to which a discount of 40% was applied was simply too high, especially in light of the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	I consider that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the applicant has made good the proposition that the aggregate sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. I would uphold ground three.
	


Resentence


	
	An affidavit by counsel for the applicant was read contingent upon this stage being reached in the appeal. It showed that in custody the applicant has achieved a C2 classification; that he is participating in a program of intensive drug and alcohol treatment; that he has been achieving qualifications by way of TAFE; that he has been working part-time; and that he continues to enjoy the support of his family. He maintains a firm intention that he will “keep away from the life that I previously had”.
	
	
	Much of the approach of the learned sentencing judge should be replicated on resentence. The offences fell within the broad middle range of objective seriousness for aggravated break, enters and steal. The sentence for the break, enter and steal offence of 24 May 2012 must be increased by the presence of the Form 1, in order to give greater weight to personal deterrence and retribution. There should be a 40% discount that reflects the early pleas of guilty and the exceptional self-inculpation by the applicant. The backdate should be identical. The finding of special circumstances that led to the imposition of indicative and aggregate non-parole periods that were half of the indicative and aggregate head sentences should be maintained. As was his Honour, I am generally guardedly impressed by the evidence of and about the applicant, both at the time of sentence and since that time.
	
	
	With regard to the sentence for the first offence in time against the funeral home, which does not feature the Form 1, I would adopt a starting point of a head sentence of four years. Applying a 40% discount, that leads to an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for a little under 29 months, which I would round down to two years four months. I would provide an indicative non-parole period of one year two months.
	
	
	With regard to the sentence for the offence of 24 May 2012 against the private home, which features the Form 1, I would adopt a starting point of five years. Applying a discount of 40% to sixty months, one arrives at an indicative head sentence of three years. The indicative non-parole period should be 18 months.
	
	
	Turning to the aggregate sentence and thereby reflecting principles of totality, I consider that there should be an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for four years, with an aggregate non-parole period of two years, each to date from 26 May 2013.
	
	
	In accordance with my proposed aggregate non-parole period, the applicant would have become eligible for consideration for release to parole on 25 May 2015, and that should now occur urgently.
	
	
	That leads me, finally, to emphasise a remark made by the Chief Judge at Common Law at the hearing of this matter; namely, that this matter languished in the list for over two years. By the time it came on for hearing on 24 July 2015, it was only a few months short of the expiry of the impugned aggregate non-parole period on 25 November 2015. The legal profession should be aware that the Court has mechanisms whereby matters that feature relatively short non-parole periods can be fast tracked, in order to avoid successful appeals being rendered otiose.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence of 3 April 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	The applicant is sentenced to an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for four years to commence on 26 May 2013 and expire on 25 May 2017 with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 26 May 2013 and expire on 25 May 2015.
	
	
	The earliest possible date of release of the applicant to parole was 25 May 2015.

		11 September 2015",2015-09-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702779,Workcover v Visy Paper P/L [2015] NSWDC 284,"SENTENCE

Visy Paper Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Boge Soleski, an employee of the offender, to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.

The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.

On the sentence hearing, Mr Moir appeared for the prosecutor and Mr Fernon SC appeared for the offender.

Preliminary issue as to the acceptance of the particulars of the Amended Summons

In the course of the sentence hearing, I was informed that the offender admitted the particulars set out in the Amended Summons, except for the last sentence of particular 7 which provides, “[T]he fatal injuries sustained by Boge Soleski when he was struck by the reversing loader in the covered paper yard were manifestations of the risk”.

Mr Moir submits that the last sentence in particular 7 is an ingredient of the actual offence specified in section 32(c) of the Act. I do not accept that submission for the reasons that follow.

Section 32 of the Act provides:

A person commits a Category 2 offence if:

(a) the person has a health and safety duty, and

(b) the person fails to comply with a duty, and

(c) the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.

All that is required to prove the element of the offence contained section 32(c) of the Act is that an individual be exposed to a risk of death or serious injury or illness. The manifestation of the risk is not an element of the offence. If it was, then it would follow that the offence could only be committed where the risk had manifested and resulted in the specific harm.

The death of Mr Soleski is taken into account in the sentencing exercise because it is a factor relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and by reference to section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Notwithstanding that it may be logical to draw an inference in the context of this case that the death of Mr Soleski was a manifestation of the risk, it is improper and unnecessary to do so, because:


	
	that is not an element of the statutory offence and that is patent from the plain words of the statute; and
	
	
	it is not a prerequisite to considering the extent of the harm suffered.
	


Facts

The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts. Unfortunately, it runs to 10 pages and is unnecessarily prolix. Remarks on sentence must be published orally so that all persons in Court can understand the sentence passed and the reasons why the sentence was passed. This is for the benefit of the offender, the victims and the public: R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 at [12]. The length of the Agreed Statement of Facts does not allow for it to be incorporated in my remarks on sentence. As a result I am required to summarise the contents of the Agreed Statement of Facts, which may result in the omission of a pertinent matter of aggravation or mitigation. I would urge the prosecutor in future matters to address this. At the very least I would expect counsel appearing in ordinary matters to be able to present a cogent statement of facts of no more than 2 pages in length that can be completely incorporated into the remarks on sentence.

The Agreed Statement of Facts can be summarised as follows.

The offender operates a waste recycling facility at Smithfield (the site). The site included a large warehouse building known as the covered paper yard (CPY). Loose and baled recyclable paper materials were delivered to the CPY by truck. Those materials were unloaded from the trucks and moved by the use of a forklift and a front end loader (FEL) with a view to loading them into a conveyor with the FEL at the western end of the CPY.

The CPY operated 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and received the materials unloaded from approximately 70 trucks per day.

Mr Soleski was employed as a forklift operator and a traffic controller in the CPY. He had been employed by the offender for 25 years at the time of the incident. When he was not operating a forklift, Mr Soleski’s duties included acting as the traffic controller and directing truck drivers as to where to unload the materials within designated exclusion zones of the CPY.

Prior to December 2012 the offender had published rules, systems and procedures (the policies) addressing workplace health and safety issues relating to the use of powered mobile equipment (PME), forklifts and FELs.

At about 10.00am on 12 December 2012 Mr Soleski operated the boom gate to allow the entry of a semi-trailer into the CPY and walked to a position in the CPY where he directed the truck driver where to park and unload. The truck driver alighted and operated the controls of the truck to unload it by mechanical means. At the time the FEL was being operated by another employee of the offender, in close proximity to the truck, the truck driver and Mr Soleski who was on foot. Whilst the truck was unloading, Mr Soleski was struck by the reversing FEL and suffered fatal crush injuries.

At the time of the incident, in breach of the offender’s policies:


	
	no traffic controller was present to ensure that safe distances were maintained between pedestrians and FELs. No traffic controller had been present for several months prior;
	
	
	there were no physical barriers to protect pedestrians (either employees or truck drivers) performing duties within the CPY from being struck by mobile plant;
	
	
	there were no exclusion zones marked out by the use of red painted zones on the floor of the CPY;
	
	
	there were no areas within the CPY within which mobile plant could operate in which pedestrians could not enter without authorisation;
	
	
	two way radios were not used to allow communication between employees within the CPY;
	
	
	the FEL was operating within 10 m of an unloading truck; and
	
	
	the FEL was operating within 10 m of pedestrians, being Mr Soleski and the truck driver.
	


Further, the reversing alarm on the FEL was not audible when it was operating above idle.

Following the incident the defendant took a number of steps to develop a safe system of work for operating mobile plant within the CPY. Measures include installing concrete barriers within the CPY, designating exclusion zones with red paint, engaging a permanent traffic controller, creating a restricted area within the CPY in which pedestrians could not enter without permission and revising and updating Site Rules and Safe Work Practices. The approximate annual cost to the offender of the concrete barriers, fencing and restructured activities for traffic control in the CPY is $692,000.

Victim Impact Statements

The Court has received and considered the Victim Impact Statements of:


	
	Goricka Soleska (wife);
	
	
	Diana Milosevski (daughter);
	
	
	Nikolina Kurioska (daughter);
	
	
	Stefce Soleski (son).
	


I find that it was appropriate to do so.

The Victim Impact Statements were read to the Court by the deceased’s family members. Each statement was thoughtfully prepared and conveyed the love held by all of the family for a patriarch who will be sadly missed.

I have had regard to the use to which I can put the Victim Impact Statements by reference to sections 3A(g) and 26-30A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

The offender’s evidence

The offender read the Affidavit of Ian Harmer sworn 20 August 2015. Mr Harmer was present at court but was not required for cross examination. The evidence of Mr Harmer can be summarised as follows.

Mr Harmer is the General Manager, Advisory Services Health Safety Environment and Human Resources of the Visy Group and has held this role since September 2012. He is responsible for safety matters in relation to the offender as well as other companies in the group.

Mr Harmer and General Manager of Visy Recycling Tony Kane visited the Soleski family to offer condolences and support on behalf of the offender following the incident. The family was offered ongoing support by the offender including the provision of grief counselling, the payment of $17,700 for funeral expenses and the payment of $5,000 for general financial assistance. Luke Krstanovski of Visy Recycling assisted the Soleski family with the processes relating to contact with WorkCover and the insurance company, because he was of a Maecdonian background. A number of Visy Group employees and senior managers attended Mr Soleski’s funeral to pay their respect to his family.

Mr Harmer was aware of the facts of the incident and had read the Victim Impact Statements. He sincerely apologised to the family for failing to provide so far as reasonably practicable for Mr Soleski’s health and safety.

Immediately following the incident the offender implemented a number of physical changes to the CPY and reviewed and upgraded the systems of work in place with respect to the CPY and the use of FELs therein. The offender provided further safety training to employees and contractors. The ‘Behavioural Safety Observation Conversation Program was implemented to encourage employees to speak with supervisors about safety issues and possible improvements.

The offender has ISO 9001 accreditation, ISO 14001 accreditation, and is audited annually to ensure compliance with AS/NZS 4801.

The Visy Group, to which the offender belongs, has in place a Safety Policy approved by the Chief Operating Officer and a number of other standards, plans and policies to ensure the safety of employees which were annexed to Mr Harmer’s affidavit. Employees are required to undertake general and site specific induction programs upon commencing with Visy which provide instruction regarding relevant safety policies, standards and procedures.

Visy sites have dedicated Workplace Health and Safety Committees, and conduct at least 12 ‘toolbox talks’ per year relating to health and safety issues.

The offender was cooperative with WorkCover and assisted in providing information, responding to questions and facilitating WorkCover interviews with employees.

Consideration

Objective seriousness of the offence

The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].

The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].

The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].

The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limted v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of forseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.

The risk was foreseeable and actually foreseen by the offender. A risk assessment of the operation of FELs was conducted on 28 May 2010 by the Visy Group for all of the sites operated in New South Wales. The risks of pedestrians being crushed between powered mobile equipment and structures and pedestrians being struck by powered mobile equipment and attachments, in the absence of controls were scored as an “extreme” risk. An “extreme risk” score could only be achieved if the likelihood of the occurrence was scored at the maximum and the consequences of the injury were considered to be a fatality. If the prescribed controls were implemented, the consequence of the injury was reduced from “fatality” to “medical treatment required”, but the combined score still remained as a “high risk”.

Following the risk assessment the offender adopted the following policies that were implemented at the site:


	
	Code of Practice: Forklift Safety dated May 2010;
	
	
	Minimum Standard: Powered Mobile Equipment and People Interaction dated May 2010;
	
	
	Safe Work Practice: Operation of a FEL (SWP 1-303) dated 1 March 2011;
	
	
	Safe Work Practice: Working around Powered Mobile Equipment (SWP 1-401) dated 8 July 2011;
	
	
	Site Rules Visy Industries Smithfield dated 5 June 2012; and
	
	
	Work Instruction Wasteyard Trucks Unloading Procedure dates 20 August 2012.
	


There were a number of material failures of the offender to follow the systems referred to that would have significantly ameliorated the risk faced by Mr Soleski on 12 December 2012 being those outlined earlier in the Agreed Statement of Facts and that:


	
	the reversing lights on the FEL required repair to ensure that they were clearly visible; and
	
	
	the visibility through the windows of the FEL was poor because the windows were not kept clean.
	


The reasons for the failure of the offender to comply with its own procedures have not been explained in the evidence of Mr Harmer. It was submitted by Mr Fernon SC that the failure to provide for physical barriers and painted exclusion zones was an “oversight” on behalf of the offender. I do not accept that submission. Whilst it was apparent that there were some precautions taken in the CPY, the published policies were not being implemented to a substantial degree. The failures were endemic and were apparent at each level of the offender’s operation. Management failed to provide the physical barriers and the painted exclusion zones, the supervisors failed to enforce the systems and the employees in the CPY failed to follow the systems.

The offender was on notice of the lack of systemic controls in the CPY as a result of an incident that took place on 25 May 2012, when a truck driver’s foot was run over by a reversing FEL. That incident was investigated by the prosecutor and the subject of an incident report and an investigator’s report.

The death of Mr Soleski is relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.

The death of Mr Soleski was preventable if appropriate precautions were taken and the objective seriousness of the offence is significant.

Deterrence

There is a requirement for the penalty imposed in relation to this offence to provide for general deterrence. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses which are inherently dangerous to employees that it is necessary to ensure that they operate without avoidable risk to the health and safety of their employees.

There is a need for specific deterrence in this case, although it is slightly reduced. The offender has a number of prior convictions and has a large workforce who are entitled to have the offender take the precautions that it has recognised as necessary and appropriate.

The matters that justify the reduction as are follows.

First, the offender took immediate steps to improve the safety of the operations in the CPY and to provide additional training and supervision of its workforce.

Second, the offender by its prior conduct, in the adoption of the various policies had demonstrated a significant commitment to workplace safety. I am satisfied that the offender took extensive steps to attempt to comply with its health and safety duty.

Third, the offender has through Mr Harmer has accepted responsibility for its failings that led to the incident and expressed an apology, remorse and contrition.

Aggravating factors

The offender has a record of previous convictions: section 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Prior convictions are pertinent to deciding where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances are set, a sentence should lie: R v McNaughton at [26]. It cannot be said in the present case that the offences before the Court were isolated. Prior convictions should not be taken into account in such a way to punish the offender again for those earlier matters, but in this case they do not assist the offender in affording to it any particular leniency.

The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The purposes of sentencing often overlap and the court must have regard to the death of Mr Soleski as an aggravating feature of the offence, notwithstanding that it has also been taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.

Mitigating factors.

The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied that the offender has demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.

The offender entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32] The prosecutor accepted that the offender’s plea was an early one. In the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.

The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Penalty

Taking all of those matters into account the appropriate penalty is $550,000. In recognition of the early plea of guilty that sum is to be discounted by 25%.

The offender is convicted and I impose a fine of $412,500.

I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.

Costs

I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.

		03 December 2015",2015-09-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702781,New South Wales Crime Commission v Stevermver [2015] NSWSC 1355,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	By summons filed in the Registry of this Court on 6 August 2015 the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeks an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”) in relation to assets and other property interests which are owned or controlled by Bernhard Stevermuer. He is the defendant in the proceedings.
	
	
	Before the Court in support of the application there is a bundle of evidentiary material including Ex A, which is an affidavit of John Patrick Egan sworn 17 August 2015. In his affidavit Mr Egan deposes that on 6 August 2015 at about 11.30 in the morning Mr Egan met with the defendant at a location in Fairy Meadow and served him with a bundle of documents relevant to the proceedings. The documents included a letter of 6 August 2015 addressed to the defendant from a solicitor with the Crime Commission, a copy of an affidavit of Jonathan Spark of the Crime Commission which is Ex B, a sealed copy of the summons which the Court is now addressing, and a sealed copy of the Statements of Facts and Circumstances filed as part of the evidentiary material which is before the Court, with a copy of the draft orders that the New South Wales Crime Commission seeks from the Court pursuant to this application.
	
	
	On the basis of that evidence from Mr Egan I am satisfied that the defendant has been served with the relevant process and is aware of the proceedings which are listed today. Indeed the defendant has been a party to consent orders when the matter has been listed before the Registrar on previous occasions - 10 August, 25 August and 8 September of 2015. It was indicated on those occasions before the Registrar that the defendant intended to consent to the orders sought by the Crime Commission.
	
	
	Although I am satisfied that the defendant is aware of today’s proceedings, he has not attended; nor has any solicitor or other legal representative attended on his behalf. Section 10A of the Act gives the Court power to proceed on an ex parte basis and I propose to proceed in accordance with s 10A.
	
	
	The evidence upon which the Crime Commission relies is principally the affidavit of Mr Spark sworn 5 August 2015, and a bundle of evidentiary material Ex JLS1 before the Court. Mr Spark is employed by the New South Wales Crime Commission as the Director of Financial Investigations and he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. He is a person authorised in writing by the Crime Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A and Pt 4 of the Act.
	
	
	As part of his duties Mr Spark has access to various computerised records including records held by the New South Wales Police Force by Land Property Information New South Wales, that being a unit of Finances and Services within the Treasury. He has access to the records of the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services and, through Crime Commission staff, access to the ASIC data base.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposes that the defendant, who uses a number of spellings of both his first name and surname, is a person who he believed to have been engaged in serious crime related activity within the meaning of that phrase as defined in s 6 of the Act.
	
	
	The defendant is charged with an offence of knowingly participating in a criminal group contrary to s 93T(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, that being an offence which falls within the definition of “serious criminal offence” pursuant to s 6(2)(g1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The basis of the suspicion held by Mr Spark as to the defendant’s engagement in serious criminal activity is based upon the inquiries of the New South Wales Police. Those inquiries have determined that the defendant was charged with a series of criminal offences including dealing with the property being suspected of proceeds of crime, and knowingly participate in a criminal group.
	
	
	On the evidence before the Court the defendant was charged with these criminal offences by the New South Wales Police on 8 July 2014. In brief, the facts of the charge against the defendant are these. In April 2014 police from the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad commenced a particular Strike Force which had the task of investigating a criminal group believed to be supplying prohibited drugs in the Sydney area. During the course of the investigation by that Strike Force it became apparent to the police that there were two criminal groups in operation, one operating within Australia and one operating from an international location. The defendant was identified as a person who was a participant in the international leg of the operation. The police investigations revealed that the defendant and persons associated with him internationally were responsible for the importation of prohibited drugs, and the precursor materials with which to manufacture prohibited drugs in Australia.
	
	
	There were related activities relevant to the laundering of money obtained through drug supply and that money laundering operation took place by the purchase, and operation of an aircraft and training maintenance business. Indeed more than one such business was in operation.
	
	
	The defendant is a person qualified to fly aircraft and he holds a commercial pilot’s licence. He is the sole director of a company known as Always Airborne. The object of the business was to purchase airplanes which were then leased or sold on for profit.
	
	
	The defendant was contacted by persons engaged in drug supply and importation activities principally it appears, because of the nature of the business that he operated, and his access to and ability to fly aircraft. Subsequently a number of aircrafts were purchased with the defendant operating as something of a conduit between persons engaged in criminal activity and financiers. There were some significant financial transactions discovered by police investigators including the transfer of money between a number of persons located in China and Hong Kong.
	
	
	On 14 February 2014 a particular aircraft was purchased and the defendant was enlisted to fly the aircraft to the Philippines, with the defendant returning from the Philippines on a commercial flight. Subsequently the defendant returned to the Philippines, collected the aircraft and flew it to a location in Malaysia. From Malaysia the defendant flew the aircraft to Coffs Harbour having come from the west of the country to the east coast. Subsequent to that the defendant was involved in the purchase of another aircraft in Malaysia, of a flight training and charter business in New South Wales, and other associated assets. There was some considerable activity in acquiring assets connected with the conduct of these various businesses and substantial amounts of money appear to have changed hands.
	
	
	On 8 July 2014 the police executed a search warrant upon the defendant’s residential premises at an address in Fairy Meadow. The sum of $40,000 in cash was found at the residence made up entirely of $50 notes. The cash was subjected to DNA testing and that DNA testing linked the cash to the defendant. A search of the defendant’s motor vehicle found a further sum of some $30,000, again made up in denomination of $50 notes. The defendant has no legitimate business or personal records which would explain his possession of such large sums of cash.
	
	
	It was the view of the investigating police, substantiated by the defendant’s plea of guilty to the relevant offence, and is the suspicion of Mr Spark, that the cash and other assets are the proceeds of crime, the crime being the large scale supply of drugs, and trafficking in drugs.
	
	
	The defendant’s role was principally to act as an aviator, a role for which he received, it would appear, substantial cash benefits together with the unrestricted use of the various aircrafts purchased by the criminal syndicate.
	
	
	As noted, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charges against him in the Local Court at Port Kembla. He was sentenced by Magistrate Stoddart on 22 May 2015 in relation to firstly, an offence of dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime and secondly, the offence of knowingly participate in a criminal group.
	
	
	With respect to the first of the offences he received a term of imprisonment of eight months to commence on 22 May 2015 and expiring on 21 January 2016 with a non-parole period of six months specified.
	
	
	In relation to the second of the offences the defendant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 19 months to commence on 22 May 2015 expiring on 21 December 2016 with a non-parole period of nine months specified.
	
	
	The Court result, which is at tab 4 of Ex JLS1, makes a reference to an appeal which was at 9 July 2015, pending. Ms Goh has indicated from the bar table, and it appears at least possible, that the defendant has obtained a grant of appeals bail prior to the determination of his appeal against severity of sentence in the District Court.
	
	
	The investigations by both the police and the Crime Commission have established that the defendant owns a number of assets and it is his assets which are suspected of being the proceeds of crime which are sought to be restrained in the summons before the Court.
	
	
	The defendant is a registered proprietor of premises at Fairy Meadow. He is the registered proprietor of two trailers each of which are listed in Schedule Two of the summons. He holds a number of share assets in both the companies he established, Always Airborne and another company called New South Wales Air Engineering Pty Limited held in the defendant’s name, and shares in a company known as Cessnock Aircraft Maintenance Pty Limited. Those shares are specified in Schedule Three to the summons. Schedule Four refers to the defendant’s ownership of shares in a company called Oregon Aero Club. Schedule Five refers to the sum of $750,000 which was paid by the defendant’s company Always Airborne for the purchase of the City of Wollongong air patrol referred to in the factual outline from the New South Wales Police.
	
	
	Schedule Six relates to the two sums of cash seized from the defendant’s home and motor vehicle on 8 July 2014. Schedule Seven refers to the various aircraft, some seven of them, which have been registered in the name of Always Airborne Pty Limited. Schedule Eight is a motor vehicle, a 2007 Audi which similarly is registered to All Waves Airborne. Schedule Nine refers to two further aircraft which are owned by Oregon Aero Club, that being the entity in which the defendant holds shares.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the suspicion held by the authorised officer is reasonably held. I accept the evidence that the Commission has tendered to the Court and accordingly I propose to make the orders sought in the summons filed by the New South Wales Crime Commission.

Factual background


	
	The applicant is aged 37 and is one of seven children (one sister and six brothers). The sister is a solicitor in a law firm in the Sydney CBD. The applicant completed year 12 at Granville Boys Senior High School and after four years of study, obtained a TAFE hairdressing diploma.
	
	
	The applicant married at the age of 24 and has four children. He and his wife have experienced difficulties in having children and there have been a number of miscarriages. The ages of the children range from 6 weeks to 8 years.
	
	
	The applicant has strong communal ties with all of his family living in Sydney. He has only one matter by way of criminal history. He was convicted of common assault seven years ago. The origin of that incident was the applicant’s belief that the person he assaulted had broken into his parents’ home. Otherwise the applicant has no history of violence. The applicant’s family background is Lebanese.
	
	
	The applicant is the sole financial provider for his family and since his incarceration, his wife has had difficulty in coping. She is said to be currently depressed and receiving psychiatric treatment. A diagnosis of post natal depression has been made. The applicant’s wife does not speak English and requires family members to make medical appointments for her.
	
	
	The circumstances leading to the applicant being charged were as follows. On Tuesday, 13 January 2015 a search warrant was granted in the Parramatta Local Court in respect of premises at 37 Wilkes Crescent, Tregear. At the rear of those premises is a garage. The applicant arranged for the fitting out of the garage as a barber shop and has conducted that business from those premises ever since. At the front of the property is a single storey dwelling where the applicant resides with his family.
	
	
	At about 9.50am on Thursday, 15 January 2015 the applicant was stopped by police and advised that they were in possession of a search warrant and proposed to search 37 Wilkes Crescent. He was escorted to that location. Shortly thereafter Tactical Police, as well as police attached to the State Crime Command Firearms Squad entered the premises where the applicant was served with an occupier’s notice.
	
	
	The inside of the rear garage consisted of barber chairs, basins, mirrors and a number of lounges along the back wall. The inside of the garage was set up as a typical barber shop. Documentation identified the applicant as operating his business from the garage.
	
	
	As police commenced searching the barber shop, they immediately sighted a six metre PVC pipe, which was approximately 100mm in diameter. The pipe was located on the floor behind a lounge with its end protruding. It was only partially concealed by the lounge and could be easily observed by police without moving the lounge. The placement of the pipe in the barber shop aroused the suspicion of police. A closer inspection revealed that both ends of the pipe were blocked with pieces of cloth material.
	
	
	When police removed that material, they located the following items within the pipe.
	
	
	1 x box ammunition
	
	
	1 x small firearm magazine containing no rounds
	
	
	1 x Ruger model 10/22 carbine semi automatic rifle, serial number 240-72896
	
	
	1 x Remington 7600 Police pump action rifle serial number B8568943
	
	
	1 x Remington 7615 Model Pump action rifle serial number B561800
	
	
	1 x Savage Mk 2, .22 bolt action rifle, serial number 1502949
	
	
	1 x Anschutz bolt action rifle, serial number 31 16919
	
	
	1 x Ten shot .223 calibre magazine containing 10 rounds
	
	
	2 x .22 calibre banana clip firearm magazines
	
	
	1 x Silencer/Suppressor
	
	
	The police also found two other PVC pipes, approximately 2 metres in length. Both pipes were sealed at each end, utilising screw fittings. There was nothing found in either pipe. There was evidence that pipes of this kind were commonly used by criminal groups to store firearms for periods of time underground to avoid detection and to prevent deterioration.
	
	
	When these weapons were discovered police arrested the applicant, who was conveyed to Mount Druitt Police Station.
	
	
	The exercise of the search warrant continued in the presence of a family member. A search of the laundry area at the rear of the barber shop, revealed two rifles in a white cupboard and one in cupboards under the sink. The following weapons were seized:
	
	
	1 x Armijager brand rifle model 1AR15 serial number 2043
	
	
	1 x Bolt action sniper rifle with scope, serial number unknown
	
	
	1 x Bruno Super model 5717, 12 gauge shotgun in parts, serial number 2571700265
	
	
	1 x plastic bag containing an amount of ammunition.
	
	
	Investigations by police of the serial numbers assigned to the firearms so located, indicated that four of the firearms were stolen from two break enter and steal incidents occurring in West Hoxton in 2010 and Umina in 2012. Other firearms, stolen during these incidents, are still outstanding.
	
	
	The applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview but declined to answer any questions in relation to the weapons or the charges which have been brought against him. The applicant is not a holder of a firearms permit and has never held a firearms permit.
	
	
	The police estimate that the current value of these firearms on the illicit market would be in excess of $140,000. It was noted that the Armijager brand rifle found in the laundry was a military style assault rifle with an automatic capacity.
	
	
	An application for bail by the applicant at Penrith Local Court on 1 May 2015 was successful and he was granted conditional bail. The Crown subsequently made a detention application, pursuant to s 50 of the Act in the Supreme Court. The application was heard on 28 May 2015 by Davies J and bail was revoked.
	


The Release Application


	
	The applicant submitted that on close examination this was not a strong Crown case. He submitted that at the time the weapons were discovered, he was suffering from back problems and his attendance at the barber shop was not regular and he had been advised by his doctor to give up work for a while and rest. He submitted that any member of his family could have placed the weapons in the garage without his knowledge. He specifically referred to a letter from the detective in charge of the investigation, which was addressed to the Court and which contained the following paragraph:
	


“In relation to the accused person’s stance on having strong community ties, the NSW Police holdings indicate the brother of the accused, Ali Abdulrahman, has links to the Comanchero Outlaw Motor Cycle Gang. During the initial stages of the search warrant on 15 January 2015, Ali Abdulrahman attended the scene and entered the driveway in his utility in an antagonistic manner. He was extremely aggressive towards police and had obvious intentions to disrupt the search warrant and the locating of the said firearms. Additionally, NSW Police intelligence indicates Ali Abdulrahman is known for matters relating to drugs, firearms and has a history of being unco-operative towards police.”


	
	The applicant submitted that when the matter came to a committal hearing or to trial it would be his case that he knew nothing about the firearms and their presence in the garage and that some other person, perhaps a member of his family, was responsible for placing them there.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that pursuant to s 17(2)(a) of the Act, there was little risk of him not appearing at court as and when required. He submitted that as a married man with four children, whose youngest child was suffering from medical complications, he was unlikely to remove himself from the jurisdiction. He submitted that he had resided at 37 Wilkes Crescent for 12 years and owed $50,000 on the mortgage. He submitted that he had six brothers and sisters, who all resided in Sydney, and had no family in Lebanon or outside Australia.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that between when he was granted bail on 1 May 2015 and when bail was revoked, he was aware of the detention application, but still fulfilled his bail conditions and attended the hearing in the Supreme Court. He proposed that a suitable person would forfeit $60,000 if he failed to appear at court as required and that he would consent to electronic monitoring if necessary.
	
	
	In relation to s 17(2)(b) (risk of commission of a serious offence), the applicant submitted that no such risk existed. He relied upon his previous good record and the absence of any serious criminal convictions. He submitted that there was no evidence of him having any connections with criminal gangs or persons known or likely to be using firearms. He submitted that to the extent that there was any risk, it could be properly managed by bail conditions, e.g. daily reporting, a curfew, electronic monitoring and compliance with any enforcement conditions.
	
	
	In relation to s 17(2)(c) (risk of danger to the victim, individuals, the community) the applicant submitted that he had never committed an offence on bail, or contravened any orders of a court. He had only one matter on his criminal record and that was many years ago. To the extent that there was any unacceptable risk, this could be met by appropriate conditions such as previously indicated.
	


Consideration


	
	It was common ground between the parties that none of the offences charged is a “show cause” offence. Accordingly, the decision for this Court is whether the applicant is an unacceptable risk in terms of failure to appear at court, the commission of further serious offences and a danger to the community and if so, whether that unacceptable risk can be appropriately met by bail conditions.
	
	
	Although the offences with which the applicant has been charged are extremely serious, were the only concern whether the applicant would fail to appear at Court, the Court is satisfied on the basis of the submissions made on his behalf, he is not a flight risk. The Court is satisfied that he does have strong ties to the community and that the surety and other financial proposals are such that his family would suffer significant financial hardship if he did not attend court. That concern could be met with appropriate bail conditions.
	
	
	The matters which are of concern, however, are those referred to in ss 17(2)(b) and 17(2)(c) of the Act. Contrary to the applicant’s submissions, the Court is of the opinion that this is a strong Crown case. There is no issue that the applicant was the owner of the premises where the weapons were found. Section 4A of the Firearms Act 1996 provides:
	


“4A (1)   Without restricting the meaning of the word possession, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the person, unless the court is satisfied that:

(a)   the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to, the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or

(b)    the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises, or

(c)    on the evidence before it, the person was not in possession of the firearm.

(2)    In this section, premises means any place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft.”


	
	It follows that the applicant was in possession of the firearms. The suggestion that someone else may have secreted the firearms in the garage is no more than speculation. The same can be said about the suggested part played by the applicant’s brother Ali. There is no evidence that Ali, or any other person other than the applicant, had any control of the garage premises before the execution of the search warrant took place.
	
	
	The circumstances relating to the finding of the weapons are also important. There appears to have been little attempt to hide the 6 metre PVC pipe. From that it can be inferred that if it were not the applicant who was responsible for the placing of the weapons in that location, the person who was so responsible had no concern that the applicant or any other person who might be expected to use the barber shop would be suspicious or might take some action concerning the pipe. The same can be said about the three weapons found in the laundry. There appears to have been no attempt to conceal them which allows the same inference to be drawn.
	
	
	The nature and seriousness of the offences are also significant matters. It is now notorious that shootings in Western Sydney are relatively common place. The unexplained cache of weapons discovered by the police at the applicant’s premises had the potential to be used in a wide array of crimes, including those intended to cause loss of life such as drive by shootings. Of particular concern is that one of the weapons was a military style assault rifle of a similar kind to that used by Martin Bryant in the Port Arthur massacre. An automatic rifle of that kind has the capacity to deliver a substantial rate of fire with one press of the trigger with the commensurate capacity to cause significant harm if aimed at a crowd of people.
	
	
	Assuming in the applicant’s favour that he was not the person who placed in the weapons in the garage, the person or persons who did so were clearly planning significant criminality. The apparent acquiescence by the applicant in the storage of these weapons would inevitably involve him in that criminality. It is for that reason that the penalties provided by s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 are so substantial, i.e. imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	There is a suggestion in the material provided by the Crown that the applicant has in the past had an affiliation with the Assyrian Criminal Network (The Last Hour). Members of that group have in the past been responsible for public place shootings. It is the advice of police that high profile organised crime groups utilise people with a limited criminal history to conduct activities on their behalf in order to avoid detection by law enforcement agencies. As has been previously been noted, police intelligence also indicated that the applicant’s brother Ali has links to a motorcycle gang.
	
	
	While these matters rise no higher than possibilities, and of themselves would be of low probative value because we do not know the basis for police suspicions, they cannot be ignored. This is particularly so in circumstances where a substantial arsenal of weapons has been found in premises owned and controlled by the applicant.
	
	
	Given the seriousness of the offences with which the applicant has been charged and the implicit criminality associated with such a collection of weapons and the potential unlawful purposes for which they could be used, the Court is satisfied that to release the applicant on bail would constitute an unacceptable risk and that such a risk could not adequately be met by bail conditions.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion the Court is mindful that the applicant has already been in custody for 5½ months and that his trial is unlikely to come on for hearing until the first part of 2016 at the earliest. The Court is also mindful of the state of health of his wife and the difficulties which she will experience if he remains in custody.
	
	
	When carrying out the balancing exercise which is required in a release application such as this, the Court is not satisfied that those considerations outweigh the protection of the public.
	
	
	The release application is refused.

		02 September 2015",2015-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702785,Stevens v R [2015] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against eight convictions for sexual offences entered by Judge Yehia SC in the District Court of New South Wales on 1 August 2014. Those convictions were entered after a trial by jury of an indictment containing nine counts ended with verdicts of guilty on eight of them, and a verdict of not guilty on one of them. Because the two proposed grounds of appeal are founded upon questions of fact, leave is required: see the judgment of Basten JA in Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	I shall recount the grounds more formally later in this judgment, but at this stage it suffices to say that the first ground is that the eight convictions are unreasonable or unable to be supported, and the second ground is founded upon what is said to be fresh evidence given by the complainant in a further trial after the trial under consideration had concluded.
	
	
	To state the allegation that substantially underpinned the prosecution against the applicant concisely, the complainant gave evidence that, in 1978 when she was 17 years of age, she was sexually assaulted by a group of men in the back of a panel van after a social event in the suburbs of Sydney. She alleged that the applicant was one of those men.
	


Procedural background


	
	In order to understand the proposed grounds, it is necessary to set out the course of proceedings in the District Court.
	
	
	On 18 September 2013, the applicant and two other men were arraigned in the District Court at Parramatta and a trial by jury commenced. I shall refer to those proceedings as “the first trial”. The complainant gave evidence in that trial on 19 and 20 September 2013. Some time later, the jury was discharged without verdict.
	
	
	On 15 May 2014, the applicant was arraigned individually before her Honour and a jury panel. I shall refer to those proceedings as “the second trial”. The applicant pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing nine counts, the first eight of which were alleged to have been committed between 1 September 1978 and 31 October 1978 at Regents Park. The ninth count on the indictment was alleged to have been committed between 1 February 1980 and 31 August 1980 at Campbelltown. The evidence of the complainant from the first trial was put before the jury by way of a compact disk recording. She gave supplementary evidence in the second trial.
	
	
	Count one averred that the applicant took away the complainant by force against her will, with intent to carnally know her (s 89 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).
	
	
	Count two averred that the applicant raped the complainant (s 63 Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count three also averred that the applicant raped the complainant.
	
	
	Count four averred that Mark Johnston raped the complainant, and that the applicant was present aiding, abetting and assisting that crime.
	
	
	Count five averred that Edward Lewocki raped the complainant, and that the applicant was present aiding, abetting and assisting that crime.
	
	
	Count six averred that Rudolf Reichel indecently assaulted the complainant, and that the applicant was present aiding, abetting and assisting that crime (s 76 Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count seven averred that Glen Partridge attempted to rape the complainant, and that the applicant was present aiding, abetting and assisting that crime (s 65 Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count eight averred that the applicant indecently assaulted the complainant (s 76 Crimes Act).
	
	
	Finally, count nine averred that the applicant raped the complainant (s 63 Crimes Act).
	
	
	It is apparent that many of those counts were brought pursuant to offence-creating sections of the Crimes Act that were repealed many years ago. Neither ground of appeal is founded upon any disjunction between the evidence in the second trial and the elements of the offences. Nor, as I have said, is there any application for leave to appeal against sentence. In those circumstances, I shall not analyse the counts further.
	
	
	As I have indicated, in the second trial, a sound recording of the evidence of the complainant from the first trial was played before the jury. That occurred without objection, pursuant to s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Thereafter, there was supplementary examination-in-chief and cross-examination of the complainant in the second trial.
	
	
	A number of further Crown witnesses were called in the second trial.
	
	
	At the close of the Crown case, an application was made by the Crown to amend the dates of the first eight counts in the indictment. That was not opposed by senior counsel then appearing for the applicant (who had also appeared for the applicant at the first trial). With regard to the first eight counts, the concluding date of the offence was amended from “31 October 1978” to “31 December 1978”.
	
	
	The accused gave evidence in the defence case in the second trial, and a number of documents were tendered through him.
	
	
	Thereafter her Honour summed up to the jury. Because neither ground asserts any error of law or fact in the summing-up, I shall not detail it further.
	
	
	As I have said, the second trial concluded with the jury returning verdicts of guilty on the first eight counts in the indictment, and a verdict of acquittal on the ninth count.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014, the two men who had been on trial with the applicant in the first trial stood trial in the District Court before a judge and jury. For convenience, I shall refer to those proceedings as “the third trial”. The complainant gave evidence in the third trial from 30 to 31 July 2014. Part of her evidence in the third trial is said to be fresh evidence. That trial ended in verdicts of acquittal.
	


Summary of evidence


	
	It is convenient now to set out a concise overview of the evidence in the second trial. In doing so I shall, of course, include a summary of the evidence of the complainant in the first trial that was tendered in the second trial, and provide transcript references to the separate extract of that evidence.
	
	
	None of the men mentioned in my summary of the evidence, other than the applicant, have been convicted of a sexual offence against the complainant. They are therefore presumed innocent of any sexual offences against her.
	


Summary of the evidence of the complainant from the first trial


	
	In the first trial, the complainant gave evidence that she was then 52 years of age, having been born in December 1960.
	
	
	In September or October 1978, she attended a social event at a suburban home. The hostess was Julie Caldwell. A number of female and male friends and acquaintances of the complainant were there. Some alcohol was consumed, including by the complainant. She recalled that Mr Reichel attended, and at the time he owned a yellow Sandman panel van.
	
	
	Whilst at the social function, the applicant, who was also a guest, pulled her onto his lap and tried to “grope” her. Because of a medical condition affecting her bones, she was of quite short stature. As well as that, her condition caused her to suffer pain when the applicant did those things.
	
	
	When the social event came to an end, it was approaching sunset. The complainant went outside. Another young woman suggested to her that the applicant liked her, and that she should approach the panel van in order to say goodbye to him. Despite the fact that she had previously been the subject of ill-treatment by the applicant, the complainant did so. The applicant picked her up and physically threw her into the back of the panel van, the tailgate of which was closed, but the rear window of which was open. She gave evidence that there was a mattress in the rear section of the panel van. There was a bench seat in the front, and of course there was no rear seat. There were also a number of young men sitting in the rear of the panel van. Thereafter, the applicant also entered the rear of the van.
	
	
	There were four men in the back. Sitting on the front seat were Mr Reichel, Sue Thomas, and Vicky Chalker.
	
	
	At TT 64.5 of her evidence in the first trial, the complainant said “they grabbed me with my arms my feet and held onto me, held me down”.
	
	
	One of the men took the underwear of the applicant off, and threw it out of the vehicle.
	
	
	In the rear of the van, the applicant pushed the complainant onto her back. He then lay on top of her and raped her; in using the legal expression that was apposite at the time, I mean that her evidence was that he had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her without her consent. It caused her pain. At the time, another man was holding her right leg (TT 67.26).
	
	
	After that, the van was driven to a point quite near the home of the complainant. However, she did not seek to alight because she felt safer in the van than out of it.
	
	
	Ms Thomas was dropped off, and left the van. A little later, so did Ms Chalker. The complainant asked to be returned to Ms Caldwell’s house, but that request was refused. The van was driven to a location where she could see gumtrees.
	
	
	The complainant sought to climb over the front seat from the rear section of the panel van. The applicant grabbed her leg, and raped her again in the back of the van. By that stage, the other men were standing outside the van.
	
	
	At the end of that second sexual assault by the applicant, he alighted and joined the other men. Thereafter, two of them raped her one after another in a similar way; namely, by lying on top of her in the back of the van. The third man, Mr Reichel, also lay on top of her whilst she was on her back, but did not attempt to penetrate her. Instead, he (bizarrely) produced a cross and held it up. Finally, a fourth man appeared to be preparing to sexually assault her, but when she bit him on the shoulder he desisted.
	
	
	Two men grabbed her under the armpits and tried to turn her over, but failed. The applicant returned to the rear of the van and straddled her whilst she was lying on her back. Her top and bra were raised. The applicant placed his penis between her exposed breasts and moved it back and forth (TT 80.24).
	
	
	After that, the second man who had raped her spoke to the other young men of using a bottle “on her”, but Mr Reichel said “No, I think she’s had enough” (TT 81.14).
	
	
	The complainant was driven away from the scene and eventually permitted to leave the van. She spent the rest of the night at the home of a man called Simon, to whom she was introduced by Mr Reichel and whom she had not previously met. The next morning, when using the toilet, she noted a rust coloured discharge from her vagina.
	
	
	After leaving the premises of the man Simon, the complainant rang Ms Caldwell from a public phone and told her that she had “been raped”. She caught a train back to the home of Ms Caldwell and told her “a little bit about what had happened” (TT 82.7).
	
	
	At a later stage, either that day or the following day, both Ms Thomas and Ms Chalker visited the complainant at her home. She said that she had been raped, but told Ms Thomas that the driver of the van had not raped her. She also told another woman present, Anita Maddock, that she had been raped.
	
	
	Many years later, in August 2010, the complainant gave a statement to police. After that, she had some contact with Ms Thomas.
	
	
	In cross-examination in the first trial, the complainant said that she had never met the applicant before the offences. She rejected the propositions that the applicant never raped her, and that the applicant had never had sexual intercourse with her in front of other young men in the back of a panel van. She agreed that she had given at least four statements to police. She asserted that her memory of events had improved, by way of mental exercises that she had been undertaking.
	
	
	She agreed that in at least one statement to police she had claimed that she could not remember the identity of the man who had straddled her and placed his penis between her breasts. She gave evidence that “I always knew who it was but I just didn’t want to remember it” and “it wasn’t something I wanted to bring up at that time” (TT 99.15 and 99.19). She agreed that, to that extent, she had not told the police the truth.
	
	
	She agreed that at no time did she scream or call out, and gave evidence that that was because she was “too scared” (TT 101.46). She agreed that no one ever placed his hand over her mouth or gagged her.
	
	
	She rejected the proposition that the panel van had bucket seats. She asserted that she thought that the front seat was a bench seat, and that was why she was unable to climb over it at one stage.
	
	
	She agreed that there was a discrepancy in what she had said at various times about the location of the social event.
	
	
	She agreed that, when the panel van first arrived at the location near her home, she did not alight from the van. She rejected the proposition that at that stage no offence had been committed against her. She gave evidence that she had made a “choice”, and that was “because I don’t know what might’ve happened if I got out of the van” (TT 107.41). She agreed that she did not alight from the van at the later stages when the other two young women did so.
	
	
	She agreed that she had gone to say goodbye to a young man who, on her evidence, had previously grabbed her and sought to grope her. She affirmed that being forcefully placed in the back of the van did not cause any injuries, and stated that the mattress had “sort of protected some of it” (TT 133.32).
	
	
	She agreed that, when the first sexual assault commenced, she did not call out for help from the occupants of the front seat of the van.
	
	
	In cross-examination she gave evidence that, at an early stage, her top had been pulled up. She agreed with the proposition that two men were holding her at one stage, “each holding an arm and a leg” (TT 136.6). Later, she said that that was occurring when the applicant took her underpants off (TT 137.21).
	
	
	It was put to the complainant that her description of the home of the man Simon could not be correct, because prior to 1980 there was no block of units in the street that she had identified.
	
	
	She was firm in her evidence that the offences occurred before November 1978.
	
	
	She agreed that one of the young women to whom she had complained had told her to go to the police, but she had not done so for many years.
	


Summary of the complainant’s supplementary evidence given in the second trial


	
	In the second trial the complainant gave supplementary evidence that, quite apart from the sexual offences committed by the applicant and others upon her in late 1978, she had also been sexually assaulted by the applicant in his car whilst it was parked in an RSL car park in February 1980. That was after she saw him inside the club at a social function. She was ordered by the applicant to enter the car. She did not say a word. She was not in a position to fight him, because of pain from a recent surgical operation. She “gave in”, but did not consent (TT 79.47).
	
	
	That evidence underpinned count nine, which, as I have said, resulted in a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	She agreed that she had suffered from postnatal depression in 1986, and gave details of that, including her treatment at a clinic. They included a concern about a connection between the horror film “Rosemary’s Baby” and the appearance of her own baby. She also agreed that at the time she was having thoughts that were “confused” (TT 54.46). She accepted that, on admission to the clinic, she had told staff that she believed that her partner’s mother may have cast a spell on her.
	
	
	She rejected the propositions that she had never been taken away in a panel van in which the applicant was present against her will; that she had never been raped in a panel van by the applicant; and that, in April 1979, she had had consensual sexual intercourse with the applicant in the panel van.
	
	
	She was asked about the details of what she may have told Ms Maddock, but was unable to remember them.
	
	
	She was cross-examined in detail about the allegation that underpinned count nine; in light of the fact that the verdict on that count is not under appeal, that does not require detailed exploration.
	


Evidence of other witnesses in the second trial


	
	Ms Caldwell gave evidence that, at a social event in 1978, she saw “one of the boys picked up [the complainant] and took her [to] the back of the car and threw her in” (TT 103.41). She saw the complainant kicking her legs at that time. That young man broadly fitted the description of the applicant. She said that the vehicle “could have been a sedan or a panel van, I’m not sure” (TT 106.1).
	
	
	The next morning she saw the complainant. She was upset, and said that she had been “gang raped” (TT 109.29). Ms Caldwell said that the complainant should go to the authorities; the complainant replied that she was incapable of doing so. She said that the complainant “described how awful it was, that they went at her two at a time” (TT 109.34). Thereafter the following exchange occurred in examination-in-chief at TT 110.03:
	


Q. What did she actually say, can you recall?

A. She said, “They went at me two at a time. How could they do that to me?”


	
	Ms Caldwell recalled that there was another woman present at the time of the complaint, but she was unable to remember who it was.
	
	
	In cross-examination, she denied that she had discussed the case with any other person, except the detective to whom she had given a statement in August 2011. She also denied that she had seen or spoken to the complainant recently.
	
	
	She accepted that there was nothing in her statement of August 2011 about seeing the complainant being taken to a vehicle and thrown into it. That memory had just “popped into” her head a couple of days before the trial.
	
	
	Ms Maddock gave evidence of a conversation that she had with the complainant at her home in “probably October or November” 1978 (TT 121.19). In short, the complainant told her of being “caught by herself at the back of a party” by “a group of boys” (TT 122.12) who “just kept coming one after another” (TT 122.17). The witness was asked about the precise location of the incident, and said the following at TT 122.43:
	


A. The location of the incident? I can’t quite recall it. I keep confusing it with being in the bedroom, with her telling me about it. So I don’t know if she – it was at a party and it was at the – I’m sure it was at the back somewhere.


	
	A little later she said “I can’t actually recall what it was she said about the location” (TT 122.50).
	
	
	In cross-examination, she agreed that she had not made a written statement until December 2011. She agreed that the conversation with the complainant could have been in early 1979.
	
	
	She was cross-examined in detail about her recollection of the complaint by the complainant. She agreed that the complainant had sworn her to secrecy. She also accepted the proposition that the complainant had said that “she was caught by herself at the back of the party” (TT 126.43).
	
	
	Janette Irving gave evidence. She had been in a relationship with the applicant until 1988. She was asked a number of questions relevant to the vehicle in which count nine was alleged to have taken place.
	
	
	A statement of Wendy Thorne was read. It was made in November 2011, and recorded that the complainant had telephoned her about six weeks before then to tell her that the police would come to speak to her. The witness had no recollection of any complaint made to her by the complainant of a sexual assault.
	
	
	Lynette O’Grady gave evidence that she had heard nothing about a sexual assault of the complainant.
	
	
	Ms Thomas gave evidence that Mr Reichel had owned a yellow panel van. It had what she at first called in her evidence a bucket seat in the front, but an analysis of the details of her evidence shows that she was describing a bench seat.
	
	
	She recalled a social event in 1978 at the home of Ms Caldwell. She could not recall the time of year. She travelled there with Mr Reichel in his Sandman panel van. She recalled leaving a social event with Ms Chalker and Mr Reichel. The applicant, Mr Lewocki, Mr Johnston and Mr Partridge walked out, and the complainant walked out with Ms Caldwell. All persons entered the panel van, with Ms Chalker sitting next to the window in the front, Ms Thomas sitting in the middle, and Mr Reichel in the driver’s seat.
	
	
	Ms Thomas recalled looking behind her and seeing in the back of the panel van the complainant, the applicant, Mr Johnston, Mr Lewocki, and Mr Partridge.
	
	
	Some time later she looked back again and saw the complainant lying on her back with the applicant on top of her and with his face towards her face. Ms Thomas “believed they were having sex” (TT 150.33).
	
	
	At some later stage, she went to turn around again. Mr Reichel said to her “Don’t look around” (TT 151.24). She remembered that Ms Chalker took hold of her hand. Later, she saw the arm of a man throw a pair of underpants from a window of the van.
	
	
	After that, the van stopped at Campbelltown, and she heard the complainant say “I can’t go home looking like this” (TT 152.13). She also heard the complainant ask that she be taken back to Ms Caldwell’s house “in a pleading tone” (TT 152.34).
	
	
	Eventually, Ms Thomas alighted from the car and went inside her home.
	
	
	Two or three days after the events in the van, she had a conversation with the complainant in the latter’s bedroom. The complainant said “They raped me” (TT 154.15).
	
	
	In cross-examination, the witness accepted that she was first asked to recall events in 2012. When contacted by the police she had telephoned the complainant immediately. She denied that there had been any conversation between herself and the complainant about the evidence of the complainant in the trial.
	
	
	She rejected the proposition that the panel van had two bucket seats in the front with a centre console between them.
	
	
	She recalled seeing the complainant at some stage at the home of the applicant.
	
	
	She agreed that she had previously given evidence inconsistent with the proposition that the panel van had a bench seat.
	
	
	It was put to her that she had never seen the applicant seeming to have sex with the complainant in the back of the panel van in the presence of other young men. She denied that proposition.
	
	
	The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Brisby, gave evidence that Ms Chalker had died in 1995. With regard to the attributes of a Sandman panel van of the kind owned by Mr Reichel, he agreed that he had basically done some research on Google, nothing more.
	
	
	He gave evidence that the police sought to interview the applicant about the allegations, but he exercised his right to silence.
	
	
	The accused gave evidence in the defence case. He firmly denied ever committing a sexual offence against the complainant. He said that he had had a “kiss and a cuddle” with the complainant at a backyard shed in early 1979 (TT 206.35). In March or April 1979, he had sexual intercourse with consent with the complainant in the back of the panel van of Mr Reichel. Mr Reichel and Ms Thomas were present in the front seat.
	
	
	He had never been to a house party of the kind described in the prosecution case. He had never taken part in the gang rape of the complainant.
	
	
	As for count nine, his evidence was that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant in his car in an RSL club car park, but it was with her consent.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he rejected the propositions that the separate consensual sexual intercourse in the presence of two others in 1979 described at [90] of this judgment had not occurred; that he had ever thrown the complainant into the back of a panel van; that he had sexual intercourse with her against her will (or at all) in a panel van in late 1978 in the presence of three other young men; and that some other young men had raped the complainant in his presence.
	


Summary of evidence of the complainant in the third trial


	
	The transcript of the complainant’s evidence in the third trial was placed before us in its entirety as an annexure to the affidavit of Stephen Green of 24 March 2015. It is relevant only to the second ground, and only in a limited way. I shall only recount the portions of the evidence of the complainant at the third trial that I understand to be relevant to the second ground.
	
	
	At the time of the third trial, counsel who appeared for the applicant in this Court was appearing for one of the other men who was then on trial.
	
	
	Counsel cross-examined the complainant about the complaint that she had made to Ms Caldwell. He asked her the following at TT 133.37:
	


Q. Did you say this to Julie Caldwell, “They went two at a time on me.” Did you say that?

A. I don’t remember saying that.


	
	At TT 134.9 the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. Well, as you sit there in the witness box now, do you say that it’s a correct and truthful account of what happened in the panel van, to describe what happened in these terms, “They went two at a time on me”?

A. That’s just reinforced something that I thought had happened.


	
	At TT 143.3, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. [Name of complainant], I think we got to the point where I had asked you to consider whether the words “They went two at a time on me”, was an accurate description of your recollection of what occurred in the back of the panel van, on the occasion that brings us to court. What do you say about that?

A. There could’ve been more that happened, from what I’ve said in my statements.

Q. Well let’s try and take that in steps. You are raising the possibility that there could’ve been more things that occurred in the panel van than you had remembered, is that right?

A. Mm-hmm.

Q. Does that mean then that you accept that your recollection of what happened in the panel van could be incomplete?

A. Incomplete, mm-hmm.


	
	At TT 143.46, the following exchanged occurred:
	


Q. There are some things you could say, is that right? Is that in addition to the things that you’ve told us about, through your videotape and through your evidence to date?

A. Yes.

Q. What are those things?

A. I don’t have a full recollection because my head kept hitting into the floor of the van.


	
	Later, at TT 144.16, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. [Name of complainant], so that we can understand what you’re telling us, do you mean to say that your head hit the floor of the van at some stage on the evening?

A. It was hitting continuous that day.

Q. Did that inhibit or restrict your ability to remember additional things that might’ve happened?

A. To see what was going on.

Q. So you’re telling us that the position of your head might’ve stopped you from observing what was going on, but surely--

A. Yes.


	
	The following exchange occurred at TT 144.38:
	


Q. [Name of complainant], I just want to give you a fair opportunity to exhaust your memory as it were. Is there nothing else you can tell us about what may have gone on?

A. I think I was lifted up, turned around, lifted up and held by the back, by two of the guys and I think they took turns.

Q. So, [name of complainant], are you saying that one of these sexual encounters involved two people taking turns. Is that what you’re telling us?

A. No, two people were actually holding while one took a turn holding me up, while one took turns. While they took turns. They swapped around.


	
	Commencing at TT 145.27, the complainant was asked questions about being held by one or more young men whilst another one of them had sexual intercourse with her:
	


Q. So are you saying that you were in a kneeling position with two people holding you and a third person having intercourse with you?

A. Mm-hmm.

Q. Do you agree that there is nothing in MFI 9, your handwritten letter, that described you--

A. Yes, nothing there.

Q. -- in a kneeling position, held by two people while a third person had intercourse with you?

A. Mm-hmm.


	
	Later, at TT 146.20, whilst being asked about a statement of hers to police, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. Similarly, there is nothing about you having sex with two people at a time?

A. No, I’m not going to check it all the time.


	
	A similar exchange occurred at TT 146.50:
	


Q. Do you further agree that there was nothing in [a statement to police] about you having sex with two people at a time?

A. No, there’s nothing there.


	
	At TT 147.11, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. Do you agree that there was nothing in that statement about you being held by two people while a third person had intercourse with you?

A. There’s nothing there.

Q. Do you agree that there was nothing in that statement about you having sex or intercourse with two people at a time?

A. There’s nothing there.


	
	Finally, at TT 147.25 the following exchange took place:
	


Q. Do you also agree that there was nothing in your evidence that you saw on video tape where you had sex with two people at a time?

A. There’s nothing there.

Grounds of appeal


	
	Two grounds of appeal were notified and pressed as follows:
	


Ground 1 – The verdicts on Count One to Eight inclusive are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. As a consequence, the convictions should be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. 

Ground 2 – The convictions on Counts 1 to 8 inclusive should be set aside because at the time of the trial, the absence of new or fresh evidence amounted to a miscarriage of justice. In all of the circumstances, the convictions should be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. 

Ground two


	
	It is convenient to deal with this ground first. Although this ground was only faintly pressed by counsel for the applicant by the end of the hearing before us, it was not formally abandoned, and I consider that it should be determined.
	


Submissions on ground two


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the portions of the evidence of the complainant at the third trial that I have extracted and summarised above should be classified as fresh evidence. That was said to be on the basis that it was “never available to the [applicant] at the time of his trial, either generally or constructively”. That was said in turn to be because the evidence was unknown to anybody, including perhaps the complainant herself, because things were coming back to her memory in the witness box.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the evidence of the complainant at the third trial raised a number of issues that significantly called into question her credibility. They included her evidence that her head had repeatedly hit the floor of the panel van (TT 144.2); the concession that her recollection was incomplete (TT 144.11); and her claim that her positioning was such that it was hard to see what was going on (TT 144.22). It was also said that her evidence that she was held down by two offenders whilst the third had sex with her (TT 144.41); that offenders swapped positions (TT 144.47); and that she was held in a kneeling position by two offenders whilst a third had sexual intercourse with her (TT 145.48) were all totally new, and were inconsistent with her statements to police and her evidence in the first and second trials.
	
	
	It was said that the evidence was of such cogency that it would, on its own account, call for the convictions to be quashed.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the operative test is contained in the well-known decision of R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63] (Kirby J, with whom Mason P and Levine J agreed).
	
	
	Counsel for the Crown did not resist the proposition that the test is contained in R v Abou-Chabake. However, he submitted that the evidence was certainly available at the time of the second trial (and in all likelihood, the first) because senior counsel then appearing for the applicant need only have asked the complainant about it in cross-examination.
	
	
	He also submitted that one can readily infer that a tactical decision was made by senior counsel in the first and second trials not to cross-examine the complainant about details of what she alleged had been done to her, except in a highly focused and structured way.
	
	
	Separately, he submitted that, properly understood, the complainant was not altering her version of the events that underpinned the first eight counts on the indictment. Rather, she was, at the invitation of defence counsel, giving evidence of other things that had occurred in the panel van, above and beyond those that she had detailed in her evidence in the past.
	
	
	Finally, he submitted that the complainant made it tolerably clear that she was not speaking of two young men having sexual intercourse with her at the same time. Rather, properly understood, one can see that what she was describing was being restrained by one man whilst another man raped her.
	


Determination with regard to ground two


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has affirmed that the operative principles to be applied to a ground of this kind are contained in the judgment of Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake: see Miller v R [2014] NSWCCA 34 at [132] (Johnson J, with whom Harrison and Adamson JJ agreed); Kidd v R [2014] NSWCCA 319 at [49] (Ward JA, with whom Fullerton and Hamill JJ agreed); and Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22 at [18] (Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom Fullerton and Davies JJ agreed). The salient portions of the latter judgment are as follows:
	


[63] … The principles may be summarised as follows:

First, a distinction is made between ""new evidence"" and ""fresh evidence"". Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence.

Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 512).

Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301).

Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought.

Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the appellant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v The Queen (supra) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399).

Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:

Is the evidence fresh?

If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or ""plausible"" (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?

If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ at 301-302.

Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s474D Crimes Act 1900) [now Pt 7 of that Act]. It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v The Queen (supra) at 517).


	
	Applying those principles to the evidence of the complainant at the third trial, I consider that the ground fails at a number of hurdles.
	
	
	First, I do not accept that the evidence given in the third trial on 30 and 31 July 2014 was something that had come back to the complainant after the conclusion of her evidence on 20 May 2014 in the second trial, a little over two months before. To my mind, if senior counsel for the applicant had asked the complainant the same questions in the second trial as were asked of her in the third trial, there is nothing to suggest that she would not have given the same answers.
	
	
	In other words, it was quite open to senior counsel for the applicant to obtain that evidence and place it before the jury in the second trial, if he wished to do so. And as my summary of the evidence of Ms Caldwell at the second trial shows at [62] of this judgment, she squarely gave evidence in those proceedings of the complaint by the complainant that “they went at me two at a time”. In other words, senior counsel for the applicant could have explored that evidence of Ms Caldwell with the complainant at the second trial.
	
	
	Because the evidence was available at the time of the second trial, it cannot be characterised as fresh evidence, in accordance with the first principle, even allowing great latitude to the applicant, in accordance with the second principle.
	
	
	Secondly, I consider that it was a deliberate and sound tactical decision made by senior counsel for the applicant at the first and second trials not to cross-examine expansively an adult woman who was giving evidence that she had been sexually assaulted by a number of men in very distressing circumstances when she had been a teenager many years before. The seventh principle therefore tells against the success of the ground.
	
	
	Thirdly, I do not consider that the new evidence is particularly cogent. Properly understood, I do not interpret what the complainant was saying as being that she was sexually penetrated by two men at the one time. Rather, I interpret what she was saying as being that she was attacked by two men at the one time, one of whom was sexually penetrating her, and the other of whom was restraining her in order to aid and abet that crime.
	
	
	It can be seen from my summary above that the complainant gave evidence that that very thing occurred in the first trial in September 2013: at [33].
	
	
	Nor do I consider that the other aspects of the evidence have much cogency. The complainant was responding to questions in cross-examination that asked her to search her memory at large, and to recount things that she may not have said before. Where a young woman is being repeatedly raped whilst lying on her back, it is not difficult to imagine her head hitting the floor of the van a number of times. The concession that her recollection was incomplete is hardly surprising, in light of the passage of three decades. Whilst it is true that the evidence of the complainant was that, during the sexual assaults she was generally on her back, it was not the case that her evidence was that she was in that position during the entirety of the ordeal: see [86] above. And I have already rejected the proposition that these recollections were “recovered” in cross-examination. Rather, I consider that they were the result of the complainant expanding upon her evidence in an open-ended way, at the invitation of counsel.
	
	
	The evidence of the complainant from the third trial does not cause me to be affirmatively satisfied of the innocence of the applicant, or to experience a reasonable doubt about his guilt, in accordance with the fifth principle.
	
	
	In light of my assessment of the cogency of the evidence relied upon, I consider that the submission that there should be a verdict of acquittal on all eight counts must be rejected.
	
	
	If one goes on to consider the alternative relief sought of a new trial, I have already explained that I do not consider that the evidence is fresh. I consider that that evidence of the complainant in the third trial is capable of belief, but do not consider that it robs her evidence in the first and second trials of that characteristic. I do not consider that, based upon the new evidence, one can be affirmatively satisfied that it would have been likely to have caused the jury in the second trial to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the applicant, in accordance with the sixth principle.
	
	
	In short, I consider that the evidence of the complainant in the third trial was the result of her being cross-examined in that trial in a way that was different from how she was cross-examined in the first and second trials. As a result, the answers were different to a degree. But there is nothing in those answers that leads me to the view that there should be a new trial, let alone verdicts of acquittal.
	
	
	It follows that I would reject ground two.
	


Ground one

Submissions on ground one


	
	Neither counsel submitted that the law to be applied with regard to this ground is controversial.
	
	
	In written and oral submissions, counsel for the applicant pointed to a number of aspects of the evidence that would, he submitted, lead us to find that the verdicts on counts one through eight were unreasonable. He did not submit that we should take into account the evidence of the complainant at the third trial in assessing ground one. The aspects of the evidence in the second trial were as follows.
	
	
	First, the very significant delay in the matter being reported to the authorities. Counsel emphasised that, of course, there was no opportunity for the complainant to be medically examined, or for any of her clothes to be scientifically examined. He also noted that Ms Chalker had passed away many years before the first complaint to the authorities, and her version of events was wholly unavailable to either party.
	
	
	Second, counsel pointed to what he characterised as unsatisfactory complaint evidence. He described the complaint to Ms Maddock as “totally inconsistent” with the evidence of the complainant. Counsel also drew attention to the evidence of Ms Caldwell that the complainant had told her that “they went at her two at a time”. He submitted that that is inconsistent with what the complainant had said in her evidence in the first and second trials.
	
	
	Third, there was said to be a lack of clarity with regard to dates. Counsel made it clear that he was not asserting that the verdicts were unreasonable because it had not been established that the offences occurred within the dates specified in the indictment. Rather, he submitted that the lack of clarity with regard to when the offences occurred, necessitating the amendment of the indictment in the second trial, was a factor that could be taken into account in assessing whether the verdicts are unreasonable.
	
	
	Fourth, counsel pointed to the actions of the complainant on the evening. He emphasised her evidence that she approached the vehicle to say goodbye to a man who had previously groped her; the fact that she did not cry out, either when being placed in the van against her will, or whilst being sexually assaulted in the back of the panel van, even though two young women were in the front of the vehicle; the fact that there may have been some inconsistency on the part of the complainant about the depth of her friendship with Ms Thomas; and the fact that the complainant did not seek to leave the van on three occasions when she could have done so.
	
	
	Fifth, he asserted that there were important inconsistencies within the evidence of the complainant. With regard to the identity of the person who indecently assaulted her by placing his penis between her breasts, counsel submitted that the complainant had deliberately misled the police on her own admission. There was confusion as to the location of the social event. There was also confusion as to the age of the complainant at the time of count nine.
	
	
	Sixth, counsel submitted that the evidence of the complainant was inconsistent with the evidence of others. It was said that Ms Caldwell and the complainant had different recollections about the details of the departure of persons from the social event.
	
	
	Seventh, counsel emphasised the psychiatric condition of the complainant in 1986.
	
	
	Eighth, he pointed to the noteworthy improvement in the memory of witnesses in the Crown case. Counsel referred to the assertion that Ms Caldwell first remembered (without any prompting from an external source) that the complainant had been placed in the back of the van a matter of days before she was to give evidence, although she had not recalled that event for over 30 years. Ms Thomas, he submitted, had also experienced an improvement in her memory with regard to the clothing worn by the complainant.
	
	
	Ninth, counsel pointed to the verdict on count nine. Although he did not submit that the verdicts on counts one to eight were unreasonable because the verdicts of guilty were unable to be rationally reconciled with the verdict of not guilty on count nine, he submitted that the quality of the evidence of the complainant with regard to count nine could inform one’s analysis of its reliability with regard to the other eight counts.
	
	
	Tenth and finally, he submitted that the failure of the detective properly to investigate the question of whether the panel van had bench or bucket seats detracted from the strength of the Crown case.
	


Determination of ground one


	
	In Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29, the High Court of Australia recently returned to the proper approach to the question of whether a verdict is unreasonable, albeit in the context of an appeal from a conviction entered after a trial by judge alone. The plurality said at [12]:
	


Authority makes plain that a jury's finding of guilt is not to be disturbed unless it appears that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the evidence is all the one way, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or unless there has been a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice…It is, however, to be borne steadily in mind that, as with a jury's verdict, so also with the judgment and verdict of a judge alone, in most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which the judge ought to have experienced.

(footnotes omitted)


	
	Their Honours then referred to M v the Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494. The passage (in its original form regarding jury verdicts) is as follows:
	


It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.

(footnotes omitted)


	
	All of the matters raised by counsel are worthy of consideration. Nevertheless, I consider that it was well open to the jury to return verdicts of guilty on counts one to eight. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, there was nothing inherently irrational or incredible about the evidence of the complainant. The proposition that a 17 year old girl, encouraged by a female friend to approach a vehicle to say goodbye to a young man who had earlier in the evening tried to grope her, is not to be dismissed as inherently unbelievable. Nor is the proposition that a young woman might subsequently feel safer in a vehicle in which others are present than if she were to leave it, including after having been sexually assaulted by (at that stage) only one of the occupants.
	
	
	Second, I do not regard the controversy about bench or bucket seats as being of great moment. Ms Thomas gave evidence that there were three persons in the front. And the complainant gave evidence that she sought to escape by clambering over the front seat, but was unable to do so because she was restrained by the applicant.
	
	
	Third, the complainant told a number of female friends that she had been “gang raped” very soon after the offences.
	
	
	Fourth, I do not accept that any inconsistency between the recollection in the witness box of the complainant about the details of what had happened 35 years before the trial, what she had said to others shortly afterwards, and the recollection of those other persons about what she had said, was of any great moment. To the extent that the evidence of Ms Maddock about the complaint by the complainant differed from the account given by the complainant with regard to the location of the offences, my extract of the evidence of Ms Maddock shows that she was hardly unequivocal about the topic. Taken as a whole, the thrust of what the complainant had said to others was, to my mind, consistent with her evidence about what had happened: that she had been the victim of a “gang rape”.
	
	
	Fifth, the evidence of Ms Caldwell corroborated the proposition that the complainant had been forcefully placed in the back of the panel van. Whilst that evidence was liable to the valid criticism that it had not been mentioned before her appearance in the witness box, it nevertheless went some way to supporting the evidence of the complainant.
	
	
	Sixth, I regard the evidence of Ms Thomas as powerful corroborating evidence. It will be recalled that her evidence was that she saw the applicant on top of the complainant, in circumstances in which one could well infer that they were having sexual intercourse in front of a number of other young men in the back of a panel van.
	
	
	Even more significantly, when she went to turn around again, she was told not to do so by the driver of the vehicle, and her hand was held by the late Ms Chalker. That evidence of Ms Thomas was firmly maintained in cross-examination. And that evidence was powerful corroboration of the evidence of the complainant that sexual contact that deserved to be kept hidden because it was a crime was occurring in the back of the panel van whilst Ms Thomas was present.
	
	
	Seventh, the jury had the recorded evidence of the complainant from the first trial, the evidence of the complainant before them in the second trial, and the evidence in the witness box of the applicant. The jury was in an immeasurably better position to judge the demeanour and credibility of the two central witnesses than this Court.
	
	
	Eighth, in light of the strength of the Crown case with regard to count nine, it is not surprising that a jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant of that offence. And it is true that the assertions of the complainant about that event are to be taken into account with regard to her credibility on the other counts. But I repeat: to my mind, the first offence committed in the back of the panel van by the applicant was directly corroborated by the evidence of Ms Thomas, and the subsequent offences were indirectly corroborated by the same evidence.
	
	
	Ninth, the jury were in a position to assess the complainant when she was cross-examined about the details of her postnatal depression. In particular, they were in a position to assess her explanations about whether she was truly delusional, or merely stressed and confused. And in any event, the episode was an isolated one that occurred over seven years after the events in question (including the early complaints), and 28 years before the second trial.
	
	
	Tenth, the jury were also in the best position to decide whether they accepted the explanation of the complainant about why she had at first deliberately not identified to the police the perpetrator of the indecent assault, which had its inherently degrading features.
	
	
	Eleventh, to my mind, the evidence was clear that the offences had occurred in the summer at the end of 1978 and the beginning of 1979. No doubt there was some confusion about the month, but that was to be expected after the passage of three decades. As I have said, no appeal was mounted on the basis that the dates in the indictment were of the essence.
	
	
	Twelfth and finally, it is true that there was a delay in complaint to the authorities. No doubt that disadvantaged the applicant, though it also disadvantaged the Crown. Consideration of those competing disadvantages was a matter for the jury.
	
	
	In short, the evidence in the Crown case is subject to valid criticisms. But none of the factors relied upon, whether alone or in combination, persuades me that it was not open to the jury to return verdicts of guilty. And the evidence in the trial as a whole, and in particular the corroborative evidence of Ms Thomas, leads me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant of the offences of which he was convicted.
	
	
	I would reject ground one.

2702786,Dawson v R [2015] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: James Dawson applies for leave to appeal against sentences passed upon him in the District Court at Newcastle on 27 June 2014 for four offences, all committed on 7 July 2013. The Applicant pleaded guilty to each charge. The sentences determined in the District Court were as follows. The maximum penalty for each offence is shown in brackets.
	



	
	Count 1: Drive whilst subject of police pursuit (s 51B, Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). Imprisonment for 18 months, comprising a non-parole period of 9 months and a balance of the term of 9 months. (Maximum 3 years).
	
	
	Count 2: Use of offensive weapon, a knife, to prevent lawful apprehension of himself (s 33B(1)(a), Crimes Act). Imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of the term of 1 year. (Maximum 12 years).
	
	
	Count 3: Aggravated carjacking (s 154C(2), Crimes Act). Imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of the term of 3 years. (Maximum 14 years, standard non-parole period 5 years).
	
	
	Count 4: Drive whilst subject of police pursuit (s 51B, Crimes Act). Imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of the term of 12 months. (Maximum penalty 5 years, for a second offence).
	



	
	On Count 3 the learned sentencing judge took into account four further offences on a Form 1 pursuant to s 33, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Those offences were also committed on 7 July 2013. They were as follows:
	



	
	Larceny of a motor vehicle (s 154(1)(a), Crimes Act), being a Honda Prelude motor vehicle which the Applicant drove during the first police pursuit, the subject of Count 1. (Maximum 5 years).
	
	
	Dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception (s 192E(1)(a), Crimes Act). Shortly before the first pursuit the Applicant put 41 litres of petrol into the stolen Honda Prelude at a service station and drove off without paying. (Maximum 10 years).
	
	
	Fail to stop and assist after motor vehicle impact causing injury (s 146, Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW)). During the first police pursuit (Count 1) the Applicant crashed the Honda Prelude into another vehicle and injured the two occupants. He did not stop. (Maximum 18 months).
	
	
	Detain person with intent to obtain advantage (s 86(1)(b), Crimes Act). After the first police pursuit had ended with the Honda Prelude off the road and undrivable, the Applicant flagged down another vehicle and forced the driver of it at knifepoint to drive away from the location. The taking of the vehicle in these circumstances is the carjacking, the subject of Count 1. This Form 3 offence is concerned with the Applicant having detained the driver. (Maximum 14 years).
	



	
	Counts 1 to 4 may be ranked in ascending order of seriousness as follows: Count 1, followed by Count 4, then Count 2, then Count 3. Appropriately, the individual sentences were determined by his Honour in a corresponding order of severity.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge ordered that the shortest sentence, that for Count 1, should commence first on 7 January 2014. That date appears to have been selected in the following circumstances. The second of the police pursuits on 7 July 2013 (the subject of Count 4) ended with the Applicant escaping. He was arrested twelve days later on 19 July 2014 in the course of committing other offences. From that date he remained in custody. He was then charged with yet further offences which had been committed on 17 July 2013. In April 2014 he was sentenced by the Local Court for the offences of both 17 and 19 July 2013. The Local Court imposed terms of imprisonment, for which the last expiring non-parole period ended on 21 May 2014.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge considered that there should be only partial accumulation of the sentences for Counts 1 to 4 concerning the offences of 7 July 2013 with the sentences for the offences committed on 17 and 19 July 2013. The effect of his Honour ordering that the terms of imprisonment with which this Court is now concerned should commence on 7 January 2014 was to allow four and a half months of concurrency with the Local Court sentences in respect of the offences of 17 and 19 July 2013. The Applicant makes no complaint about this aspect of the custody dates determined by his Honour.
	
	
	The sentences for Counts 4, 2 and 3 were ordered to commence on 7 July 2014, 7 January 2015 and 7 July 2016, respectively. This resulted in an accumulation of 2 years and 6 months to be served in addition to the longest individual sentence, being that for Count 3 (7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years). The result was an effective non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months and a balance of the term, overall, of 3 years.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	The sentencing judge, in determining totality of sentence, erred by inadequately applying partial concurrency as between each individual sentence.
	
	
	As a consequence of Ground 1 the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	



	
	In written submissions on behalf of the Applicant it was expressly “not submitted that any of the four individual sentences imposed are manifestly excessive”. Further:
	


“It is equally not submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in not making any sentence imposed totally concurrent with any other sentence.”


	
	Affirmatively, written submissions on behalf of the Applicant asserted specific error in that his Honour did not adopt a measure of concurrency which, so it was said, was called for by the following features of the entire episode of 7 July 2013:
	


“similarity between offences”;

“similarity in criminality”;

“common intention of avoiding apprehension (and in this sense forming one episode of criminality)”;

“shortness of time over which the offences occurred”.

It was submitted that these features “point more toward concurrence than accumulation”.


	
	In respect of Ground 2 it was argued that even if this Court should not be persuaded as to specific error in the manner in which his Honour partly accumulated the sentences, nevertheless “the overall sentence imposed, applying totality, is manifestly excessive”. Both grounds, thus argued, require consideration of the facts of the offences and a review of the Applicant’s antecedents and subjective circumstances.
	


Facts


	
	On the evening of 6 to 7 July 2013 the Applicant stole a blue Honda Prelude motor vehicle from outside the home of its owner in Lake Munmorah, a locality approximately 40 kilometres south of Newcastle (the first count of the Form 1). About 11:52am the next day, 7 July, he filled the car with petrol at a service station in Killarney Vale, a further 27 kilometres further south (approximately). This is the petrol he did not pay for (the second count on the Form 1). He then drove north and at about 3:35pm was observed driving the Prelude on Main Road, Jesmond approximately 9 kilometres east of Newcastle. The police officer who made this observation was carrying out stationary speed enforcement duties. He recorded the Prelude, initially, at 120 km/h in a 90 lm/h zone, then accelerating rapidly to 146 km/h. The officer gave chase in his police vehicle.
	
	
	In committing the offence charged as Count 1 the Applicant’s means of evading interception by the police vehicle included driving in a southerly direction in the northbound breakdown lane of Maitland Road, cutting through built-up traffic to mount a median strip and to perform a U-turn, travelling at high speeds through areas with heavy traffic volume and swerving harshly at an intersection when the police vehicle in pursuit was within 100 metres. This last manoeuvre caused the Applicant to lose control of the Prelude in Maitland Road at Hexham, leading to a collision with another vehicle. The two occupants of the other vehicle were injured and their vehicle was rendered undrivable.
	
	
	The Applicant remained in his vehicle near the point of this collision until the police officer who had been in pursuit approached him on foot. The Applicant then accelerated away from the scene in a southerly direction on Maitland Road.
	
	
	The events giving rise to Count 2 are as follows. An off duty police officer named Hopkins driving his private vehicle followed the Prelude from the collision scene referred to above. Some distance to the south he saw that the Prelude had left the road and come to rest in a swamp. He approached it. He said “Mate, I’m a cop, get on the ground”. He took hold of the Applicant’s left shoulder and arm and began to push him to the ground. However Hopkins moved away when he noticed that the Applicant had a knife in his right hand. The Applicant swung the knife at Hopkins and advanced towards him. After searching in Hopkins’ own vehicle for keys and stating “I’ll take your car then”, the Applicant entered the waters of the Hunter River adjacent to the swamp and attempted to swim to a nearby island. He shortly returned to the shore and again moved towards Hopkins threatening him with the knife.
	
	
	Next, and giving rise to Count 3, the Applicant crossed Maitland Road on foot, to the northbound lanes. He still held the knife but concealed it. He caused a Mr Phillips, who was driving his Land Rover in a northerly direction, to stop in order to avoid hitting him. The Applicant then got into the front passenger seat of Mr Phillips’ vehicle and asked Mr Phillips to drive him to Maitland. The off duty officer, Hopkins, commenced to follow Mr Phillips’ Land Rover, in his private vehicle. The Applicant then produced his knife, held it towards Mr Phillips and directed him to “lose” Hopkins. He threatened Mr Phillips saying “Drive. Drive. Drive. I don’t want to hurt ya”.
	
	
	Marked police vehicles joined the pursuit of the Land Rover. The Applicant directed Mr Phillips to undertake dangerous manoeuvres to evade the police. Mr Phillips was after some time able to slow his vehicle to about 30 km/h at which point he opened the driver’s door and jumped from the moving vehicle.
	
	
	At this point the events of Count 4 commenced. The Applicant moved to the driver’s seat of the Land Rover, accelerated towards a roundabout, performed a U-turn, swerved to the incorrect side of the roadway and proceeded in the face of oncoming civilian and marked police vehicles. He thus caused the pursuing police to terminate the pursuit. The Land Rover was last seen by police travelling in the breakdown lane of the New England Highway toward Newcastle.
	


The Applicant’s points in favour of concurrency


	
	None of the four points raised by the Applicant as set out at [9] carries any significant weight in favour of total concurrency of the sentences or towards any lesser degree of accumulation than that determined by his Honour. There is no basis for concluding that his Honour overlooked those four considerations. However none of them required discussion in his Honour’s sentencing remarks because they did not mitigate the seriousness of each offence individually or of the criminality involved in the four offences viewed together.
	
	
	The primary consideration tending towards a degree of accumulation is that each of the four offences constituted a discrete additional criminal act involving, in each case, a fresh determination of the Applicant to commit a dangerous and unlawful act in order to escape apprehension. The events of the first pursuit, in Count 1, ended with the Honda Prelude crashed in a swamp beside Maitland Road, Hexham. The Applicant had, up to that point, endangered numerous other road users and collided with one other vehicle injuring its occupants. His criminal behaviour for the day could have ended there. Instead he initiated a second and different phase by threatening with a knife a police officer who identified himself as such and who endeavoured to arrest him.
	
	
	The avoidance of apprehension by threatening Officer Hopkins concluded with the Applicant crossing Maitland Road away from the officer. Again the Applicant had the choice to refrain from further criminal activity. Instead, he embarked upon a new and still more serious criminal enterprise by hijacking Mr Phillips’ car. Even when this ended with Mr Phillips’ desperate escape from the moving vehicle the Applicant did not stop. Rather, he commenced another course of driving dangerously to outrun police, in the second vehicle he had stolen within 24 hours.
	
	
	It is inapposite for the Applicant’s submissions to speak of “the shortness of time over which the offences occurred”. The whole course of offending, comprising the four counts, was protracted, relative to the type of offences concerned. The “similarity between offences” and the “similarity in criminality” are of no significance to the issue. The offences took place one after the other, each commencing in discrete and separate circumstances. This was not a case of several charges all arising out of one incident and constituting a number of different criminal characterisations of the same conduct.
	
	
	The “common intention of avoiding apprehension” is self evident. But contrary to the Applicant’s submissions that common intention does not weld the facts into “one episode of criminality” in any sense relevant to the issue of accumulation or concurrency. It was an “episode” comprising four offences, distinct in particulars and in time, committed one after the other.
	
	
	The Applicant’s submission that the “criminal conduct in each offence was spontaneous” is equally of no weight in support of the proposition that his Honour erred in accumulating to the degree that he did. Given the separate points of departure for each aspect of offending, the Applicant’s submission must involve the proposition that he acted spontaneously and on the spur of the moment on each of the four occasions when he commenced each new unlawful act. In reality what is shown by the above description of the events is a sustained and persistent determination on the Applicant’s part to defy the lawful authority of police, exposing them and the public to significant danger in the process.
	


Antecedents


	
	The facts set out above speak for themselves as to the objective seriousness of each of the offences and of the total criminality. The Applicant’s antecedents and subjective circumstances will now be stated so that all aspects may be taken together in evaluating whether the overall result arrived at by his Honour, with the degree of partial accumulation which he adopted, was disproportionate to the entire sequence of counts.
	
	
	His Honour drew upon a clinical psychologist’s report, commissioned by the Applicant’s solicitor, to which this Court has again been referred on the hearing of the appeal. The Applicant was born on 24 February 1985 and was therefore 28 years old at the date of these offences. He is the second of six children. His psychologist assessed him as “a reserved individual of low but functional intelligence”. Early stages of his childhood development were compromised by his father’s involvement with drugs and, from the age of about 11 years, a lack of “meaningful contact with his parents or his siblings”. Other aspects of his early childhood years were traumatic and likely to have had lasting adverse effects on his psychological well-being. These are referred to in the psychologist’s report and are taken into account but it is not necessary to detail them here.
	
	
	The Applicant failed to learn to read or write at school. Truancy resulted in his expulsion in year 8. He attempted to gain literacy and numeracy at a TAFE College over three years to the age of 16 but made no significant improvement. He was first imprisoned at the age of 23 and gained some further education in custody.
	
	
	The Applicant has had a relationship with a female partner over a period of nine years from the age of 17. They have three children together.
	
	
	The Applicant used cannabis extensively from the age of 10 until his early 20’s. He has continued using it since at a reduced intake. He also used methylamphetamine or “ice” in his late teens and early twenties. He does not appear ever to have had any employment and has been supported by Commonwealth benefits from Centrelink since his mid to late adolescence.
	
	
	His criminal history includes the following (omitting reference to a Children’s Court matter, having regard to s 15A, Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) and given that this judgment will be published on the internet):
	



	
	January 2004 (aged 19 years): carried in a vehicle without consent of owner. Ordered 2 years supervision.
	
	
	March 2004 (aged 19 years): break and enter a building and steal goods. Community service order, 150 hours.
	
	
	April 2008: (aged 23 years): take and drive a motor vehicle without consent of owner. Imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months, commencing 9 December 2009 (concurrent with the sentence for the offence next mentioned).
	
	
	15 December 2008 (aged 23 years): drive dangerously occasioning death and drive a vehicle taken without consent of owner. Imprisonment for 5 years and for 2 years 6 months, respectively, with an effective combined non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 21 September 2009 and concluding 20 March 2013.
	



	
	The Applicant was released from prison, after serving his sentence for the offences of December 2008, only 3½ months before commission of the offences now under consideration in this Court. In March 2013 the Applicant told his psychologist that he considered himself still separated from his ex-partner although they resided together, with the Applicant’s parents, following his release. Then in April 2013 they had an argument which ended with the ex-partner stabbing herself five times. She was hospitalised but upon discharge attempted to gain full custody of their three children and to prevent the Applicant from having access to them.
	
	
	The Applicant further told his psychiatrist that on the day of the offence he had received a call from his ex-partner to the effect that she was going to harm herself again. He claimed to have stolen the first motor vehicle for the purpose of going to see her. None of these subjective consideration is particularly influential in a case which called for an overall sentence of sufficient length to meet the requirements of specific and general deterrence and protection of the community.
	


Proportionality of overall sentence to total criminal conduct


	
	The Applicant’s criminal record involves repeated unauthorised use of other people’s motor vehicles and repeated instances of driving dangerously, on one occasion having caused the death of a passenger travelling with him. Against that background each of the offences committed on 7 July 2013 represented a progression of his disregard for the safety of other road users, a continuance of his lack of respect for property rights of motor vehicle owners and an escalation of his defiance of the law and of police. Taking into account all of the objective and subjective circumstances of the offending there appears no basis for disturbing the orders made in the District Court.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		02 September 2015",2015-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702787,Perish v R; Lawton v R [2015] NSWCCA 237,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: By two Notices of Motion Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton seek to uphold and enforce orders for production of documents issued by the Registrar at their request, addressed to the New South Wales Police. The documents are sought in connection with the Appellants’ respective appeals to this Court against convictions for murder and conspiracy to murder.
	
	
	On 14 September 2011 Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton (“the Appellants”) were found guilty of the murder of Terrence Falconer after a trial by jury over 36 days. Andrew Perish was tried with them for conspiracy to murder, on which charge verdicts of guilty were returned against all three accused. On 13 April 2012 the Appellants and Andrew Perish were convicted and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment: R v Perish [2012] NSWSC 355. They are currently serving those sentences.
	
	
	The conviction appeals of both Appellants are listed to be heard by this Court in September 2015. The orders for production which they have caused the Registrar to issue to the Proper Officer of the NSW Police are both in the same terms, as follows:
	


“All documents, notes, or other material relating to the payment of a reward for information in the investigation into the death of Terrence Falconer.”


	
	On the application of the Commissioner of Police, RA Hulme J set aside these orders to produce on 29 May 2015: Perish v R; Lawton v R [2015] NSWCCA 129. Thereafter, the Appellants filed the Notices of Motion which are now before the Court, seeking that his Honour’s order be itself set aside and that the full Court of Criminal Appeal determine whether or not the production orders should stand and be complied with.
	
	
	The Commissioner has acknowledged that a reward was paid by NSW Police in relation to the offences of which the Appellants were convicted. It is said on behalf of each Appellant that the documents sought may prove or support an inference, or lead to the discovery of other evidence, that one or more of the Crown’s witnesses at the time of giving evidence expected a reward or held the intention of applying for one. The Appellants argue that if they could show the existence of such an expectation or intention on the part of one witness in particular, a man referred to at the trial as Witness A, this would substantiate certain of their appeal grounds.
	
	
	It is said that the appeal grounds identified for the purposes of this application are intended to be supported by additional factual contentions. Namely that police knew of the witness’ expectation or intention and promised the reward or promised to support an application for it. The grounds which the Appellants would seek to advance upon such facts, if the facts could be shown, would invoke principles concerned with either (a) the emergence of fresh evidence or (b) material breach of the Crown’s duty of disclosure – in either case going to a matter upon which Witness A might have been cross examined as to his credit.
	
	
	The Commissioner disputes that any legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the documents has been shown. He therefore objects to production and submits that the decision of RA Hulme J to set the orders aside was correct. In any event the Commissioner makes a claim of public interest immunity with respect to any document which may answer the orders. He does not contend that the public interest sought to be protected is of such a nature that he should not be required to disclose whether there exist any documents within the description of the orders. Nor does the Commissioner object to the Court inspecting any such documents for the purposes of determining the public interest immunity claim.
	
	
	In order to address the issues which arise it is necessary to have regard to the facts of the commission of the offences, the role and significance of certain witnesses and the chronology of both the police investigation and the public announcement by the NSW Government of offers of reward. It will also be necessary to consider the appeal grounds which it is said might be supported by the documents, to see whether there is any real possibility of such support.
	


Investigation and evidence of the murder


	
	As at 16 November 2001 Falconer was an inmate of Silverwater Correctional Complex. He had been working for some months in a motor vehicle repair business at Ingleburn, under a day release program. Late on 16 November 2001 witnesses informed police that earlier that day three persons posing as police officers had attended the repair yard, handcuffed Falconer and driven him away in a motor vehicle. Human remains found in the Hastings River at Wauchope on 26 November 2001 were subsequently determined to be the remains of Falconer.
	
	
	In early December 2001 police established Strikeforce TUNO to investigate Falconer’s abduction and murder. In late August 2002 they commenced to receive information from Witness A. A detailed statement of this witness was prepared in May 2003 and signed on 15 July 2003. A second statement was signed in November 2003 and a third statement in September 2007.
	
	
	Anthony Perish was arrested for the murder of Falconer on 19 January 2009 together with another man referred to at the trial as Witness E. The latter admitted his own role in the abduction and murder during a record of interview.
	
	
	On 25 January 2009 the NSW Government publicly announced the offer of a reward for information leading to the arrest, charging and conviction of persons associated with the death of Terrence Falconer. The announcement was by way of a media release by the then Minister for Police and by Detective Inspector Jubelin, the officer in charge of the investigation. A reward of $200,000 was offered. In the same media release, offers of rewards for information leading to the conviction of persons involved in other murders and an attempted murder were announced. By this time Police Strikeforce TUNO 2 had been established, with expanded objectives of investigating murders additional to that of Terrence Falconer.
	
	
	Matthew Lawton and Andrew Perish were arrested on 27 January 2009 and 5 February 2009, respectively. Both were charged in relation to the death of Terrence Falconer.
	
	
	A trial of the Perish brothers and Matthew Lawton commenced in July 2011 but was aborted on 25 July 2011. A new trial, which continued to verdict, commenced on 27 July 2011. Evidence given by Witness A for the Crown was to the effect that in early October 2001 Anthony Perish told him that he, Perish, planned to kill Falconer and to dismember his body. Witness A was asked by Anthony Perish to bring his trailerable outboard motor boat to a river about 200 kilometres north of Sydney, on a date to be fixed, to motor it up the river to Bulahdelah and there to meet Anthony Perish. Perish would have with him “a couple of eskies” containing Falconer’s dismembered body.
	
	
	Witness A and Anthony Perish agreed in late October or early November 2001 that Bulahdelah was not a suitable rendezvous because of speed restrictions applicable to vessels on that part of the river. In early November 2001 Anthony Perish instructed Witness A to take the eskies, from wherever they were ultimately to be collected, out to sea, to the edge of the continental shelf, and there to empty the contents in deep water. Anthony Perish directed Witness A that the eskies themselves should be washed out and discarded on the way back to the coast and that the boat should then be washed out with ammonia.
	
	
	According to Witness A, Andrew Perish was also present at some of these discussions. Andrew Perish provided Witness A with funds for the carrying out of mechanical repairs to the boat to put it in working order for the planned purpose. Matthew Lawton provided Witness A with a dedicated mobile phone for use in connection with arranging the disposal of Falconer’s body.
	
	
	On the evidence of Witness A, Matthew Lawton drove Anthony Perish to the property where Witness A resided on at least three occasions in about late October to early November 2001, at which time Witness A and Anthony Perish discussed the plan for disposing of Falconer’s body. On one of these occasions Anthony Perish produced to Witness A a document which purported to show that Falconer was prepared to give evidence against members of the Rebels Motorcycle Club at Dubbo, regarding their alleged drug dealings. Andrew Perish was a former member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club. Witness A’s evidence regarding this exchange established at least one motive of Anthony Perish for the murder.
	
	
	Witness A gave evidence that from about 12 November 2001 he decided not to participate in the planned disposal of Terrence Falconer’s body parts. He had come to fear for his own safety. He said that he in fact took no further part in the plan beyond that date.
	
	
	Evidence of other witnesses established that, before proposing to Witness A that he should assist with the disposal of the body, Anthony Perish had arranged with Witness E that the latter should obtain a van and a large lockbox, in which Falconer could be secured after he had been abducted from the premises where he worked under his day release program. Witness E recruited two others to assist in the abduction. On the afternoon of 16 November 2001 Witness E parked a white van at a location not far from Falconer’s place of work. He met the other two recruits there.
	
	
	One of the recruits dressed as a police officer. All three proceeded, in a Commodore motor car which had been made to look like an unmarked police vehicle, to the repair yard. Police identification badges were presented to employees of the business who then accompanied Witness E and one of his recruits to the part of the yard where Falconer was working. Falconer was handcuffed, returned to the car and removed from the premises. Witness E applied a chloroform soaked rag to Falconer’s mouth and rendered him unconscious whilst the Commodore was being driven to the place where the white van was parked. Falconer was then placed in the lockbox within the van.
	
	
	Witness E gave evidence that he transported Falconer, secure in the lockbox, by means of the white van to Turramurra. There he met Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton who transferred the lockbox onto the tray of a utility. By that vehicle it was transported to Girvan, 220 kilometres north of Sydney, with Lawton driving and Witness E as passenger. Anthony Perish disposed of the white van and arrived at Girvan sometime later.
	
	
	There was conflicting evidence as to whether Falconer was dead on arrival at Turramurra. The Crown led evidence that he was certainly dead by the time the utility reached Girvan. The Crown case was left to the jury in such a manner that their verdict did not determine whether Falconer was still alive when Witness E arrived in the white van at Turramurra. For the purpose of sentencing the trial judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was alive at that stage: R v Perish [2012] NSWSC 355 at 59.
	
	
	On a property at Girvan, Falconer’s body was dismembered by Anthony Perish, Matthew Lawton and Witness E. The body parts were placed in plastic bags that were sealed up and dropped in the Hastings River. Six of the bags were found in the river on 26 November 2001 and the seventh was located on 13 September 2002.
	
	
	Witness E was called by the Crown at the trial of the Perish brothers and Matthew Lawton. He contradicted what he had previously told police (which had been to the effect of [18]-[22] above) and purported not to remember the events which constituted the offences. Leave was given for the Crown to cross examine him and his record of interview was adduced in evidence.
	
	
	The evidence of Witness A was clearly important to the Crown case against each of the three accused. Although he had not been a participant in or a witness to the abduction, murder and disposal of human remains, his evidence that Anthony Perish discussed with him Perish’s intention to do these things would have been very significant to the jury. Witness A’s truthfulness and credibility were attacked by defence counsel in cross-examination.
	


Police dealings with Witness A


	
	Before the trial the accused had been provided with a statement of Inspector Jubelin made 27 April 2010 which recounted in detail the course of his contacts with Witness A during the investigation, from the first contact on 29 August 2002. Over 130 contacts were particularised in this statement, with a summary of the date, medium and subject matter of each and with reference to electronic records of what had passed between police and the witness on each occasion. These contacts occurred mostly in the fifteen months up to November 2003, at which time Witness A signed his second statement. Thereafter there were some contacts in late September 2007 when a third statement was signed and again in March 2008 when a memorandum of understanding with the witness was signed. The next contact after this was in mid March 2009 when a further memorandum of understanding was signed.
	
	
	Inspector Jubelin’s statement included a number of references to occasions when Witness A spoke to police of his concerns about welfare and physical security. There were also references to his relocation and to the provision of money to pay for the relocation and for other expenses. The final paragraph of the statement recorded that the provision of finance to Witness A had been approved by the State Crime Command of NSW Police and by the NSW Crime Commission. It was quite apparent to the Appellants and their legal representatives at the trial that Witness A considered himself at risk of retribution from associates of the three accused and that the police were reasonably required to provide him with protection and assistance in relation to concealment and relocation.
	


Conduct of the trial


	
	In an affidavit sworn 27 August 2014 and relied upon on the hearing of the Notices of Motion, trial counsel for Anthony Perish has deposed:
	


“3. During the course of the trial I became aware that a reward had been offered.

4. Before the trial commenced the Crown had produced a large volume of material described as ‘investigators notes’ which contained notes made of contact between police investigators and witnesses called by the Crown.

5. There was no indication in those notes that the police had spoken to the person known as Witness A about a reward or that he had any intention of claiming such a reward.

6. The evidence relied upon from this witness had been elicited by the investigators in 2002 and thereafter, long before the reward was offered.”


	
	In an affidavit sworn 19 June 2015 and similarly relied upon in the present application, trial counsel for Matthew Lawton deposed as follows:
	


“2. Some time after my being briefed to appear at the trial, my instructing solicitor, Mr Elias Matouk, provided me with a folder of material relating to Witness A. I understand that this material was served upon him by way of disclosure before the committal hearing in the Local Court. This material comprised a series of investigator notes relating to communications between Witness A and the police.

…

4. During the course of the trial I became aware of the fact that a reward had been offered. There was no suggestion in the folder referred to in paragraph 2 or indeed in any other material provided to me during the course of the Appellant’s trial which suggested that Witness A had been offered a reward, or that he was entitled to make a claim on a reward, or that he was going to claim a reward upon the conviction of the Appellant.”


	
	On the hearing of the present application the Appellants tendered page 521 of the transcript of 19 July 2011 from the first trial which was later aborted. This seems to have been from a stage in that first trial when Witness A was giving evidence and before Witness E had been called. It appears from the transcript that Mr Grady then appeared in the interests of the Commissioner of Police to claim public interest immunity in respect of the answers to some questions which might have been asked of the witness. The passage now relied upon by the Appellants is as follows:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, there is one issue which I think may involve me. It involves Mr Grady but would be obvious given the way I’ve led the current witnesses (sic) that, to use the vernacular, no deal was done with him, there was no undertaking signed, no reward given, no benefits offered. Now, his circumstances are that as with all witnesses, but with this one, the public has borne some expense in respect to him.

Now if there’s any cross-examination along the lines that he has received some benefit by his sustenance or other day-to-day expenses whatever they were I’d be concerned about that, because there are particular reasons why this witness has received sustenance and such things which really are obvious given his status. So I just make that plain, because I think my friend here is going to have something to say on behalf of the Commissioner about it but I too, but that would be my position, respectfully. These, the Crown is obliged to lead any evidence of undertakings, benefits, offers, letters of comfort, pulling of charges, that type of thing as going to the credit of a witness and the Crown is required to do that in chief and so Sullivan’s case says, that the type of thing that I’m referring to is an entirely different category. It doesn’t fall within that type of evidence, but I’m just not asking your Honour to do anything at this stage, but I am just putting that on the record.

HIS HONOUR: Have there been discussions with counsel concerning that, for the accused?

GRADY: Yes, your Honour, I raised the matter yesterday with Mr Terracini [appearing for Andrew Perish] and I’ll obviously stand corrected, I believe that there is an intention to ask the current witness concerning amounts he has received by way of sustenance. I believe that relocation and such matters aren’t going to be raised, but the whole legal reason for the sustenance is because of the relocation, uprooting and the like, your Honour, and the Commissioner would raise an objection to anything apart from the fact that the witness has received expenses for relocation and expenses for sustenance. If it comes down to actual payments or amounts received and the like there is some confidential information before your Honour in a claim that was earlier raised…”


	
	The reference to “Sullivan’s case” is no doubt to Sullivan v R [2003] NSWCCA 100, in which a majority of this Court considered that the Crown had not fulfilled its duty “to lead in evidence all material of that kind which is relevant in order that the jury is fully informed of those matters which would enable it to make a proper assessment of the witness’ credibility” (per Buddin J at [95]). The principal Crown witness in that case had received the benefit of a 50% discount on his sentence in consideration for giving evidence against the accused. He was exposed to the risk of being resentenced and his term of imprisonment increased if he failed to give evidence as agreed. The jury were not informed of the extent of his discount, which amounted to a reduction from 15 years imprisonment to 7½ years; nor was it explained to them what was meant by his exposure to being “resentenced”.
	
	
	In the trial of the Appellants which commenced on 27 July 2011 and which is the subject of the appeal pending in this Court, neither of the Appellants’ counsel cross examined Witness A about whether or not police had promised him that he would receive a reward or told him that they would support an application by him for a reward. Witness A was not cross examined as to whether he intended to apply for a reward or whether he expected to receive one. He was not asked by defence counsel anything about a reward. Counsel for Andrew Perish did not cross examine on these topics either. This was despite both of the Appellants’ trial counsel knowing of the Government’s reward offer and it being obvious that if convictions should ensue Witness A’s evidence would almost certainly be viewed as having led to or contributed to that outcome. Witness A would clearly have a basis for being favourably considered if he should choose to claim the reward. There was no evidence before the Court on this application as to whether Witness A was cross examined at committal on the subject of a reward.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Browne was responsible for the control and direction of the investigation into Falconer’s abduction and death, together with Inspector Jubelin, from early December 2001. He gave evidence in the trial after Witness A. On 23 August 2011 he answered a question in chief as follows:
	


“Q. Did [Witness A] ever ask for, or was he in any way promised any reward for the information that he provided police during his contact with you in association with this matter?

A. No, never, and in fact a reward wasn’t published for this investigation until quite some years later.”


	
	By “quite some years later” he clearly meant later than the period during which Witness A provided important information to police and in which he prepared and signed his principal statement and assisted police in gathering additional evidence. That was up to about November 2003.
	
	
	The Appellants rely upon the following passages from the final address of the Crown Prosecutor. First, at T 1518 the Crown addressed as follows:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: … with respect to Witness A, Witness A was spoken to by Detect Cown (sic – should read Detective Browne) in the early part of 2002. 27 February 2002 police spoke to him briefly in relation to the investigation into the death of the Perishes [grandparents of Anthony and Andrew Perish], and he refused to give police a statement in relation to that matter.

So there you are, in February 2002 he’s not seeking any benefit from the police, or seeking to curry favour with the police, or seeking to obtain some protection from the police in association with things he had previously done. There is nothing. Nothing. He doesn’t approach them, they want to speak to him about something else, he didn’t speak to them about this matter at all. It was only when the police turn up on his doorstep on 29 August 2002 that he thought, right, these people need to be told in respect of the Falconer matter they got the wrong man, and that is when things began to role (sic) …”


	
	At T 1519 the Crown’s address continued in these terms:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: What may be put to you … is that there may be inconsistencies in his [Witness A’s] account during the early period before he gave his statement. You should weigh that submission carefully into the equation and bear in mind Witness A has told you his apprehension at cooperating with police – his apprehension, with the notion of cooperating with police. That concept, that fact, sits at odds with the idea that he was a man seeking to obtain some kind of benefit as a result of anything that happened in the early years, or, in any event, in any way whatsoever. You heard his evidence that he has received no benefits and you may think, in fact, his life has been turned upside down by what he has done in this case.”


	
	At T 1530 the following was said:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: Now he [Witness A] participated in this exercise of obtaining very important evidence and then returned to live his life, to be summonsed some years later into these proceedings after charges were laid in 2009, Anthony Perish arrested in the company of Witness E at their favourite cafe and Lawton arrested not long after. No reward, no benefit, no money, no discount, no deal, nothing.”


	
	From these statements made by the Crown, by Mr Grady and by Detective Sergeant Browne the Appellants say that they were given to understand that Witness A testified without any promise of receiving a reward for doing so. The jury were given the same understanding from such statements as were made in their presence (see [33] to [37] above). In contradiction of these statements both Appellants seek to prove on the appeal that to the knowledge of police and with promises and encouragement from them, the witness expected a reward. It is said that these matters, if now established, should have been disclosed by the Crown. If that had occurred the defence would have put the matters before the jury, significantly altering the impression conveyed by the passages quoted at [33] to [37].
	


Events leading to the issue of the notices to produce


	
	On 2 December 2012 an article was published in the Sunday Telegraph, authored by Yoni Bashan under the headline “$770,000 that’s what it cost to solve State’s toughest crimes”. This article included the following assertions:
	


“The biggest reward handed out to an informant so far this year was $200,000.

The money was given to a protected source who assisted investigators with the 2001 abduction and murder of drug dealer Terry Falconer.

In that case, known as strike force Tuno, the supergrass had to wait almost 10 years to receive the money.

He provided the information in August 2002 and only received the money this year after the three men accused of Falconer’s murder were convicted.”


	
	A further passage, to much the same effect, was as follows:
	


“SOLVED

MURDER OF TERRY FALCONER (2001)

Reward $200,000

Offered January 25, 2009

Information received August 2002

Amount paid $200,000 on February 22, 2012

The murder of police informant Terry Falconer was at the centre of one of NSW’s longest-running investigations. Three people were convicted over his murder.”


	
	Anthony Perish’s solicitor wrote to Inspector Jubelin concerning this newspaper article nearly fifteen months later, on 14 February 2014. Inspector Jubelin responded by email of 24 February 2014 as follows:
	


“I had no dealings with the author in relation to this article. I am not in a position, nor am I prepared to make any comment as to its accuracy. NSW Police do not release information to the media or public concerning the payment of government rewards. This is based on policy and ‘public interest immunity’ issues.”


	
	In submissions counsel for Matthew Lawton sought to have the Court infer from the newspaper article that:
	



	
	there must in fact have been paid out the whole of the offered sum of $200,000 by way of reward;
	
	
	the recipient must have been Witness A, having regard to his importance to the Crown case;
	
	
	there must be documents relating to the reward payment and
	
	
	these would show that the payment was made to Witness A.
	



	
	The article is hearsay and has not been attributed by its author to any source or to any basis of information and belief. It is therefore not a foundation for any inference. The article has ceased to be of significance for determining the threshold question referred to in item (c) above, whether there may be documents which would answer the description in the orders to produce. Direct evidence of the existence of such documents has been provided on behalf of the Commissioner, to the extent described in the following paragraph. The direct evidence also obviates the inference referred to in (a) above. The Commissioner has acknowledged that an application for reward was approved although the evidence does not disclose how much was paid. The Commissioner’s evidence does not identify who received a reward (items (b) and (d) above) because public interest immunity is claimed in respect of that information.
	


Evidence tendered by the Commissioner


	
	The Commissioner of Police, seeking that the orders to produce documents should remain set aside, relied upon two affidavits of Deputy Commissioner N. Kaldas. Mr Kaldas deposed that the officer in charge of an investigation into a serious offence may apply to the Reward Evaluation Advisory Committee (“REAC”) for a Government reward to be offered. The application must be accompanied by a detailed report outlining the investigation and the reasons why a reward offer is sought. It must be signed by the Commander of the relevant State Crime Command Squad. REAC is constituted by an Assistant Commissioner, two senior executive officers and two other sworn members of the NSW Police Force of or above the rank of Inspector. If the application is supported by REAC then a report is submitted to the Minister for Police for approval.
	
	
	Mr Kaldas’ evidence is that this procedure was applicable in 2008 and 2009 and was followed in this case. Detective Jubelin submitted a report to REAC on 7 February 2008, requesting the offer of a Government reward in relation to the investigation into the abduction and murder of Falconer. REAC supported the application. A report was submitted to the Minister and on 27 February 2008 the Minister approved the offer of a Government reward. However the offer was not announced until 25 January 2009, as mentioned in [12], after the arrest of Anthony Perish and Witness E.
	
	
	Mr Kaldas further deposed that an application for a claim on this reward was submitted by Inspector Jubelin to REAC on 20 September 2011 and approved in October 2011. He gave the following evidence with respect to the article published in the Sunday Telegraph on 2 December 2012:
	


“32. The contents of that article were not discussed with Inspector Jubelin, as Officer-in-Charge, prior to publication. Assistant Commissioner Peter Barrie is quoted in that article, however, the comments he provided were specifically in relation to processes and policy, and did not concern the payment of rewards and/or amounts.

33. The details in the article concerning the amount of payments for rewards in relation to the murder of Terrence Falconer are inaccurate.

34. At no stage were any of the witnesses or persons who provided evidence or gave assistance to NSW Police in relation to Strike Force Tuno-2 promised or guaranteed a reward by investigating police. Investigating police do not have the authority to promise any person the payment of a reward. An application for a claim on a reward will generally only be considered upon the arrest and conviction of an offender, and following consideration by REAC. Ultimately, the payment of a claim on a Government reward is at the sole discretion of the Commissioner of Police.

35. Inspector Jubelin is of the opinion that witness ‘A’, and the other witnesses in the appellant’s trial, were aware that a Government reward had been approved in relation to the Falconer murder. Similarly, Inspector Jubelin is of the opinion that Witness ‘A’, and the other witnesses in the appellant’s trial, were aware that they had a right to make a claim on that Government reward.

36. Neither Inspector Jubelin nor any officer under his supervision gave any promise or guarantee to Witness ‘A’, or any of the other witnesses, prior to or whilst he or they were giving evidence in the appellant’s trial, that he or they would receive a reward for doing so.”

Appeal Grounds


	
	It is necessary to identify the appeal grounds to which the Appellants say the orders to produce are relevant. Consideration must be given to what facts the Appellants may legitimately seek to prove in support of those grounds. No view on the prospects of success of these grounds is intended to be expressed by what follows.
	
	
	In an Amended Notice of Grounds of Appeal filed on behalf of Anthony Perish on 13 July 2015, the grounds identified by counsel as relevant to consideration of the present application appear as follows:
	


“4. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the failure to disclose to the Appellant information relevant to the eligibility and intention of a prosecution witness or witnesses to claim reward monies from the State in the event that the Appellant was convicted, in breach of s 15A of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) or s 137 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1987 (NSW) or both.

4A. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned due to the absence at trial of evidence which has since become available.”


	
	Supplementary submissions in the substantive appeal, filed on behalf of Anthony Perish on 13 July 2015, show that Ground 4A is concerned with evidence of the application by Inspector Jubelin on 20 September 2011 for a claim on the reward in respect of the Falconer investigation. This is said to be fresh evidence.
	
	
	Anthony Perish sought to illustrate how the documents sought under the orders to produce may assist his case on Ground 4A, concerning fresh evidence, by reference to Da Silva v R [2012] NSWCCA 129. In that case the circumstances which warranted an order for retrial were not just the fact of a reward having been given but the existence of evidence from a solicitor in the DPP’s office that the relevant witness (the accused’s brother) had said after the trial:
	


“The only reason for doing it (giving evidence) was because I was offered a reward”.


	
	In the Da Silva appeal police denied that they had “offered” or promised a reward to the witness before he gave evidence but said that they had discussed with him prior to the trial the possibility of a monetary reward being applied for and granted. The fresh evidence which sustained that appeal was not merely evidence that the witness had known of the possibility of applying for a reward or that police had informed him of this. It was evidence of his post-trial declaration that he “only” gave evidence because he was “offered a reward”: [22], [39], [40].
	
	
	On behalf of Matthew Lawton, Amended Grounds of Appeal were filed on 2 October 2014 in which the only ground presently relevant is as follows:
	


“6. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the failure to disclose to the Appellant information relevant to the eligibility, and intention, of Witness A to claim reward monies, in the event that the Appellant and/or his co-Appellant were to be convicted.”


	
	Anthony Perish’s Ground 4 and Matthew Lawton’s Ground 6 are non-disclosure grounds. The Crown could only have been obliged to disclose matters known to it, including through police, at or before the trial. The facts, alone, that following the verdicts a claim for reward was lodged on behalf of one or more witnesses and that the claim was accepted would not appear capable of sustaining the non-disclosure grounds.
	
	
	In connection with these grounds it would seem necessary for the Appellants to show that at or before the trial police knew, in relation to a witness who in fact subsequently received a reward, that (a) the witness intended and expected to receive the reward and/or (b) police had promised a reward to that witness and/or (c) police had promised to support that witness’ application for a reward. Proof that the police knew one or more of these matters in relation to an identified witness whose evidence was significant at the trial would appear to be a minimal requirement for the non-disclosure grounds to be arguable.
	
	
	Anthony Perish’s Ground 4A, particularised as explained in [49] above, is based solely upon the post-trial events of application for reward and payment, as matters of fresh evidence. Ground 4A purports to be founded upon fresh evidence of an application for and payment of a reward and upon inference therefrom of the witness’ expectation at the time of trial. The ground purports not to rely upon any allegation that the police had knowledge of the witness’ expectation or that they contributed to it by promises. Any contention on appeal that police knew of a significant witness’ expectation of reward would correctly be directed to a non-disclosure ground, not a fresh evidence ground: Grey v R [2001] HCA 65.
	


Legal principle


	
	It was accepted by counsel for both Appellants that in circumstances where the Commissioner has objected to compliance with the orders for production the Appellants must show not merely that documents caught by the orders are or might be relevant; they must identify a legitimate forensic purpose in obtaining them: R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 17-18; R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at 11; Attorney General for NSW v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 681; Attorney General for NSW v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65 at [58]-[64]. The concept of demonstrating a legitimate forensic purpose has been expressed in contradistinction to seeking documents merely “to discover whether he has a case at all” (Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR NSW 564 at 575). In a similar vein Mahoney AP in Carroll v Attorney General for NSW (1993) 70 A Crim R 162 at 181-182 said:
	


“It is not open to a party, as on a ‘fishing expedition’, to subpoena documents merely in order to determine whether they may be relevant and may be of assistance to his case in the proceeding. …. In the case in which the party did not know what was the nature or the contents of the documents, the position would be plain. He could not claim to look at the documents merely to see whether they contained something which might be relevant or help his case. …. He must be able to indicate that the document is relevant in the sense that it may assist his case. In the present case, that could not be claimed. Nor was it shown. At best, the claim was: ‘I wish to see the document to see if it may assist my case’. That in my opinion is not sufficient.”


	
	The Appellants also accepted that they must establish that it is “on the cards” that the documents they seek will materially assist their case: R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at 11; Attorney-General for New South Wales v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65 at [58]-[80].
	


Submissions for Appellant Anthony Perish


	
	Counsel for Anthony Perish asserted that an inference could be drawn, at least from Mr Kaldas’ evidence that an application for a reward was approved in October 2011, that Witness A must have been paid that reward. From this counsel submitted a further inference was available as follows:
	


“19 An inference is therefore available that Witness A knew about the possibility of claiming a reward at the time he gave his evidence. It is also an available inference that Witness A was motivated, at least in part, on the basis of a belief that he could become eligible to receive a reward were he to give evidence that led to a conviction.

20 These inferences are strengthened by the evidence given at trial regarding the past conduct of Witness A. … there was evidence in the trial that Witness A had previously been motivated to speak to the police on the basis that he could claim some reward money in relation to another matter. There was also evidence that he also attempted to provide evidence to the Crime Commission in an attempt to gain protection and other benefits.”


	
	These putative inferential conclusions are directed solely to Witness A’s subjective state of mind when he gave evidence and not to anything known by or said by police. They are therefore concerned with Anthony Perish’s Ground 4A concerning fresh evidence, not with Ground 4 concerning Crown non-disclosure.
	
	
	The inference referred to in par 19 of the Appellant’s submissions quoted at [58] above, that Witness A knew of the possibility of claiming a reward when he gave his evidence, flows independently of anything in Mr Kaldas’ affidavit. It flows from the fact that the reward was publicly offered on 25 January 2009 and that Witness A would likely have learned that the reward was offered, either by being told of it by police or through the media. The offer and hence the strong probability that Witness A would have known of it were within defence counsel’s knowledge at the time of the trial: see [28] and [29]. The further inference suggested in par 19 that Witness A was motivated in giving his evidence by the prospect of receiving the reward was not put to the witness at trial.
	
	
	Mr Kaldas has acknowledged that a reward was applied for and approved. It is apparent that post-trial documents relating to the reward application and payment exist. From these facts, coupled with the significance of Witness A to the Crown case and the circumstances and extent of his assistance to police in their investigation, the Appellants submit that it is “on the cards” that documents produced under the disputed production orders would show that Witness A received a reward. But to show that the documents could have any utility for his appeal the Appellant Perish must go further. He must show that it is “on the cards” that such documents would reveal something about Witness A’s expectation regarding the reward at the date of the trial and/or about police knowledge of that expectation.
	
	
	Anthony Perish’s counsel suggested that the orders to produce might bring forth documents disclosing directly or by inference:
	


“(a) any awareness by Witness A or any other Crown witness as to the existence of the reward before the conclusion of their evidence at trial;

(b) any discussions with Witness A or any other Crown witness as to the existence of the reward before the conclusion of their evidence at the trial;

(c) any correspondence with Witness A or any other Crown witness as to the existence of the reward before the conclusion of their evidence at trial;

(d) any promise, assurance, undertaking or agreement relating to the payment of the reward given to Witness A or any other Crown witness before the conclusion of their evidence at trial;

(e) any discussion regarding supporting payment of the reward to Witness A or any other Crown witness before the conclusion of their evidence at trial.”


	
	As to (a) there does not appear to us any real chance that the documents in connection with Inspector Jubelin’s application for reward on behalf of any witness in the case or relating to the payment of any reward would add anything to the proof, already available by inference from the material known to the defence at trial, that Witness A was aware of the possibility of claiming a reward at the time of giving his evidence.
	
	
	With respect to each of (b) to (e), it was submitted that it might have been significant for REAC in determining whether or not to pay a reward to take into account anything that a witness “was told about the prospect of receiving a reward, including whether any application by him would be supported by police”. This proposition is purely speculative. It finds no support in the unchallenged affidavit evidence of Mr Kaldas. It is not a basis upon which we would find it to be “on the cards” that any documents in connection with the post-trial claim on the reward would likely produce documents useful to the Appellant as revealing matters of the kind set out in paragraph [62].
	
	
	There is there inherently no reason to expect that documents in connection with the claim on the reward would refer to any pre-verdict communication between police and the witness holding out that a reward might be given. Further, Mr Kaldas has deposed without challenge that no promise or guarantee of reward was given by investigating police to any witness (see [46]). He has deposed that police do not have authority to make such promises and that rewards are in the sole discretion of the Commissioner, exercised only after conviction and following consideration by REAC. This is further supported by Detective Sergeant Browne’s denial that Witness A made any request for a reward or that he was “in any way promised any reward” which was not challenged in cross examination at the trial.
	


Submissions for Appellant Lawton


	
	Matthew Lawton relies upon the primary facts established by Mr Kaldas’ affidavit, namely that a claim on the reward was submitted by Inspector Jubelin one week after the jury’s verdict and that that application was approved by REAC in October 2011. From this he submits that it may be inferred:
	



	
	that the approval was given effect to, by the payment of a reward and
	
	
	that “it is highly probable that there are in existence documents which demonstrate that there was a payment of a reward in relation to the offences of which the Appellant was convicted”.
	



	
	It is further argued for Matthew Lawton that, as the reward was offered for “information leading to a conviction of those” responsible for the murder of Falconer, the only persons who would qualify would be Witness E (who would not likely receive the reward given that he became an unfavourable witness for the Crown at the trial) and Witness A. On this application the Court has not been given sufficient evidence about the entirety of the police investigation or about the evidence given by other witnesses to be able to say whether the field of possible reward recipients is or was as narrow as the Appellant Lawton contends.
	
	
	However, assuming for the purposes of the application that it may be inferred from the primary facts deposed to by Mr Kaldas and from the course of the investigation and trial that there are likely to exist documents which would demonstrate the payment of some reward to Witness A in respect of his evidence leading to the conviction of the Appellants, what forensic purpose could the Appellant Lawton have in gaining access to such documents? The ground to which it is sought to relate the order for production is Ground 6 quoted at [52], concerned with the Crown’s duty of disclosure.
	
	
	As with the case put for Anthony Perish, the forensic purpose propounded by the Appellant Lawton is that he wishes to try to obtain documents which might record or prove that Witness A intended, at the time of giving evidence in the trial, to claim on the reward and that police officers (or other agents of the Crown) knew of this and/or encouraged in Witness A an expectation of reward.
	
	
	In accordance with the accepted tests the Appellant must then show that it is “on the cards” that there will be such documents, revealing such intent of the witness and such knowledge of the police. For reasons already given in relation to the similar argument for Anthony Perish, in our view that is not “on the cards” at all but is quite fanciful.
	
	
	Matthew Lawton’s counsel has submitted that “it is only of minimal significance whether or not police, in fact, spoke to Witness A about the availability of the reward prior to trial … Naturally, a person who is aware of the availability of a reward may seek to curry favour with authorities by continuing to assist police, regardless of whether he has become aware of its existence from police directly or indirectly through a press conference …”. Given that Matthew Lawton’s only appeal ground relevant to the reward is Ground 6 concerning failure of the Crown to make disclosure, it is difficult to see how this can be advanced solely upon the basis of asserted facts about Witness A’s intentions and motivations and without proof of what the police may have known of them. There is no real chance that such proof would come from the documents sought under the disputed orders.
	
	
	In the submissions of both Appellants on this application some emphasis was placed upon par 35 of Mr Kaldas’ affidavit where he deposed that Inspector Jubelin believes Witness A and other witnesses were aware of the reward offer and of their entitlements to claim on it. However it is not apparent in what way this opinion of the Inspector would presently assist the Appellants. It is an opinion that anyone who knew of the offer of reward (which includes defence counsel at the trial, according to their own affidavits) would have formed. The fact that Inspector Jubelin holds this opinion about the awareness of witnesses at the time of the trial does nothing to overcome the improbability that any documents connected with the post-trial application for reward would refer to or prove (a) any witness’ knowledge of the reward at an earlier and relevant time or (b) any knowledge on the part of police, prior to or at the trial, regarding any witness’ intentions concerning the reward.
	


Public interest immunity


	
	Notwithstanding the improbability that documents brought into existence in connection with the application for the reward in September 2011 would refer to an intention or expectation of any witness at the time of the trial, or would refer to pre-verdict communications between police and any witness concerning the reward, the members of the Court hearing this application have examined the documents which would answer the orders to produce. These documents are identified and the grounds upon which public interest immunity is claimed in respect of them are explained in confidential affidavits of Mr Kaldas sworn 18 August 2014, 1 September 2014 and 29 July 2015.
	
	
	The test which must be applied to resolve the public interest immunity claim is as stated by Gibbs CJ in Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 412:
	


“[W]hen one party to litigation seeks the production of documents, and objection is taken that it would be against the public interest to produce them, the court is required to consider two conflicting aspects of the public interest, namely whether harm would be done by the production of the documents, and whether the administration of justice would be frustrated or impaired if the documents were withheld, and to decide which of those aspects predominates. The final step in this process – the balancing exercise – can only be undertaken when it appears that both aspects of the public interest do require consideration - ie, when it appears, on the one hand, that damage would be done to the public interest by producing the documents sought or documents of that class, and, on the other hand, that there are or are likely to be documents which contain material evidence. The Court can then consider the nature of the injury which the nation or the public service would be likely to suffer, and the evidentiary value and importance of the documents in the particular litigation.”


	
	Here, on examining the documents, we have formed the view that none of them would be of the slightest utility to either of the Appellants in furtherance of the grounds and arguments which they wish to raise on appeal as explained to the Court in submissions on this application. None of those documents would be of any assistance to either Appellant even indirectly, as indicating or validating some further course of enquiry or of gathering evidence relevant to the appeal.
	
	
	On the other hand, Mr Kaldas’ confidential affidavits have convinced us of the significant harm which would be done to effective policing generally in this State and to the capacity of the New South Wales Police Force to protect witnesses if these documents should be required to be produced under the Registrar’s orders and made available for inspection by the Appellants’ counsel. The balance referred to in Gibbs CJ’s judgment is overwhelmingly in favour of upholding the claim to public interest immunity.
	


Orders


	
	For these reasons, the Notices of Motion of each of the Appellants, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton should be dismissed. The effect of such dismissal will be that the order of RA Hulme J made 29 May 2015 setting aside the Registrar’s orders to produce (respectively dated 1 July 2014 in the case of Anthony Perish and 4 February 2015 in the case of Matthew Lawton) will stand.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the Appellant, Anthony Perish on 16 June 2015 is dismissed.
	
	
	The Notice of Motion filed 25 June 2015 on behalf of Matthew Lawton is dismissed.
	



	
	PRICE J: At the commencement of the hearing, Mr Dhanji SC, who appears for Anthony Perish, made an application that I recuse myself from hearing the notices of motion. The application was founded on the principle of apprehension of bias as I had presided at the appellants’ trials and the proceedings were said to be “part of the appeal process” (T 1 L30-49, 30/7/15). The application was refused, by Hoeben CJ at CL, the presiding Judge, on my behalf and now I provide reasons for the rejection of the application.
	
	
	The test of apprehension of bias is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that a judicial officer might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind in determining the issues for decision: Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; (2011) 244 CLR 427 at [31], Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at [11], In the matter of Cheal Industries Pty Ltd - Fitzpatrick v Cheal [2012] NSWSC 812 at [23]. It is an objective test, not a subjective one (Michael Wilson [33], [67]).
	
	
	The application of this test requires two-steps:
	



	
	Identifying what it is said that might lead the judge to decide a case or legal question other than on its legal and factual merits (Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [8], In the matter of Cheal Industries Pty Ltd - Fitzpatrick v Cheal [2012] NSWSC 812 at [23]); and
	
	
	Articulation of the logical connection between the matter identified and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the question on its merits (Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [8], as confirmed by the High Court in Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; (2011) 244 CLR 427 at [31], [63]).
	



	
	As has been articulated in the Court’s judgment, the present proceedings concern the appellants’ applications to set aside the orders of RA Hulme J. The matters argued on the motions had nothing to do with issues raised before me during the trial or any orders that I may have made. The verdicts of guilty were returned by the jury, as the sole judges of the facts, and not by me as the trial judge.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I was of the opinion that Mr Dhanji did not identify a coherent reason as to why a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind in determining the issues for decision on the notices of motion.

2702797,Sporting Shooters Association of Australia v Judge [2015] NSWDC 201,"Judgment


	
	These proceedings are listed for hearing as a non-jury defamation trial for five days commencing on 9 November 2015. The application before me is whether the parties’ evidence in chief should be given orally, or in the form of witness statements.
	


The history of the proceedings


	
	The plaintiffs commenced proceedings by statement of claim filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 26 October 2012. After a series of timetabling orders and interlocutory applications (see Sporting Shooters Association v Judge [2013] NSWSC 1783; Sporting Shooters Association of Australia v Judge (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1821), these proceedings were transferred to the District Court of New South Wales by McCallum J on 7 April 2014.
	
	
	Following orders for discovery and interrogatories, the proceedings were set down for hearing by the Judicial Registrar of the District Court on 17 December 2014, as a five-day hearing commencing on 9 November 2015. These orders were made on the assumption that no further case management was necessary. The Judicial Registrar provided a review date of 1 September 2015 and, there being outstanding interlocutory applications, referred the proceedings to the Defamation List for determination of the plaintiffs’ application for evidence in chief to be given by way of statement.
	
	
	These are my reasons for granting the plaintiffs’ application. Additionally, I have made some orders of a case management nature, including a referral of the proceedings to mediation.
	
	
	I shall first set out the issues for determination at the hearing.
	


The pleadings


	
	The current statement of claim is the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 10 February 2014. It is a complex pleading, and may be summarised as follows. On or about 20 May 2012 the defendant published an email (Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim) to various branches of the Sporting Shooters Association attaching three attachments. One of these attachments is undated and marked Schedule C. Schedule D is dated 16 May 2012 and Schedule E is dated 18 May 2012. Schedule F is a schedule prepared by the plaintiffs referencing the relevant passages of Schedules C, D and E in which they say the pleaded imputations arose.
	


Schedule C – The undated attachment


	
	In relation to the first plaintiff, the following imputations are pleaded to arise from the undated attachment (paragraph 19 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The First Plaintiff acted despicably by supporting the Third Defendant [sic - Plaintiff] in its attempt to drive Paddy McGuire out of the organisation.
	
	
	The First Plaintiff supported the Third Plaintiff in its prosecution of baseless legal proceedings against the Third Plaintiff’s former Committee members; and
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has caused, or has supported the Third Plaintiff in causing, four of the Third Plaintiff’s former Committee members severe financial stress.
	



	
	The “Particulars of Extrinsic Facts” relied upon in relation to the imputations pleaded at paragraph 19 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim are as follows:
	



	
	Paddy McGuire is a former President and member of the Third Plaintiff, and a current member of the Guyra branch of the First Plaintiff.
	
	
	On 8 December 2010, Mr McGuire and his wife, Lynette Gail McGuire, brought proceedings no. 2010/406050 (the “McGuire Proceedings”) against the Third Plaintiff in the Local Court of New South Wales in Maclean.
	
	
	In the McGuire proceedings, the Third Plaintiff brought a Cross-Claim (the “Cross-Claim”) against the 6 former members of the committee of the Third Plaintiff as on 28 June 2010 (the “Cross-Defendants”), including Mr McGuire and Sally Marea Bates.
	
	
	On 24 July 2012, the McGuire Proceedings were dismissed by the Local Court of New South Wales in Grafton, with an Order that the costs of the Third Plaintiff in those proceedings were to be paid by Mr and Mrs McGuire on an indemnity basis.
	



	
	In relation to the third plaintiff, the following imputations are pleaded to arise from the undated attachment by reason of extrinsic facts (paragraph 19A of the Further Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The Third Plaintiff has acted despicably in attempting to drive Paddy McGuire out of the organisation;
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff has prosecuted baseless legal proceedings against the Third Plaintiff’s former Committee members; and
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff has caused four of the Third Plaintiff’s former Committee members severe financial stress.
	



	
	The extrinsic facts relied upon in relation to the imputations pleaded at paragraph 19A are the same as those pleaded for the imputations at paragraph 19.
	


Schedule D – The 16 May 2012 attachment


	
	In relation to the first plaintiff, the following imputations are pleaded to arise from the 16 May 2012 attachment (paragraph 19B of the Further Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	[Imputation deleted]

	The Third Plaintiff is possibly trading while insolvent; and
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff agreed to vote in support of the First Plaintiff’s agendas at general meetings of the First Plaintiff, regardless of whether or not that was in accordance with its members’ interests, in exchange for funding.
	


Schedule E – The 18 May 2012 attachment


	
	In relation to the first plaintiff, the following imputations are pleaded to arise from the 18 May 2012 attachment (paragraph 19E of the Further Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The First Plaintiff is not spending its money in the best interests, and for the benefit, of its member branches;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has unethical members on its board;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff caused the drafting of fraudulent constitutions and imposed them on its member branches so that those constitutions would benefit the First Plaintiff and not its member branches;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has interpreted the fraudulent constitutions of its member branches in a way that benefits the First Plaintiff and not its member branches;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has misled its members about the state of its financial affairs;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff sought to undermine a properly elected Committee of the Third Plaintiff;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has acted fraudulently by withholding from its member branches their rightful share of funds received by the First Plaintiff from individual membership fees provided to it by the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia Inc;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has perpetrated a fraud on its member branches and their members;
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has conducted a campaign of intimidation and defamation against members of the Third Plaintiff;

	The First Plaintiff is more dishonest than Christopher Skase; and
	
	
	The First Plaintiff has been corrupted into a dictatorship.
	



	
	The particulars of extrinsic facts relied upon for these imputations are as follows:
	



	
	The First Plaintiff repeats particular (i) to paragraph 19 above and particulars (i) and (ii) to paragraph 19B above.
	
	
	Pam Reeves was, from February 2010 to May 2010, the senior vice-president and an employee of the First Plaintiff.
	
	
	The First Plaintiff is a member of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia Inc, which is an incorporated association in South Australia that is registered for the purposes of the Associations Incorporation Act 1985 (SA).
	
	
	Paddy McGuire and 5 other committee members of the Third Plaintiff were removed from office at a special general meeting of the Third Plaintiff held on 30 June 2010 in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales.
	



	
	In relation to the third plaintiff, the following imputations are pleaded to arise from the 18 May 2012 attachment (paragraph 19F of the Further Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The Third Plaintiff convened a Special General Meeting in a manner that was in disregard, and resulted in the perversion, of principles of law or justice;
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff ignored its own constitution in the manner in which the Special General Meeting was called;
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff brought a Cross-Claim in the McGuire Proceedings for the purpose of bullying the cross-defendants, who were members of the former Committee of the Third Plaintiff; and
	
	
	The Third Plaintiff is more dishonest than Christopher Skase.
	



	
	The extrinsic facts relied upon by the third plaintiff repeats the particulars set out in paragraph 19 and particular (iv) to paragraph 19E of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.
	
	
	I should additionally note that all three plaintiffs are incorporated associations and accordingly there is no claim for aggravated compensatory damages: NRMA Insurance Ltd v Flanagan [1982] 1 NSWLR 585.
	
	
	The defence filed on 21 March 2014 pleads:
	



	
	A denial that the imputations are conveyed and defamatory;
	
	
	A defence of common law qualified privilege (paragraphs 17 and 26 - 27);
	
	
	A s 30 defence of qualified privilege (paragraphs 18 – 19 and 28 – 32);
	
	
	A defence of honest opinion pursuant to s 31 (paragraphs 20 and 23 – 25);
	
	
	A s 33 defence (paragraphs 21 and 33); and
	
	
	A claim of mitigation of damages (paragraph 34).
	



	
	The factual material set out in support of the defence of honest opinion refers to an “internal dispute” within the third plaintiff during 2009 and 2010 which resulted in meetings and discussion over an extended period, court proceedings, and further disputes and legal proceedings which were “ongoing” (paragraph 23(w)) at the time of publication of the first matter complained of. This history of disputes, court proceedings and conversations over a period of several years is submitted to be the reason why statements of evidence would both shorten the matter and clarify the issues before the court.
	


The plaintiffs’ application for evidence to proceed by way of statements


	
	As noted above, both parties agree that the factual evidence in these proceedings covers a long at hotly-contested series of events in 2010, including meetings, litigation and conversations between the parties’ witnesses.
	
	
	Although much of the factual matrix relates to what occurred in company meetings, Mr Knackdstredt submits that the accuracy of the factual material upon which the opinion in certain of the imputations is based (for example, in imputations such as being “more dishonest than Christopher Skase”) would depend upon what the defendant asserted had occurred at those meetings, as opposed to minutes of meeting. He submitted that the matrix of factual material, including the comments made by the defendant concerning the conduct of earlier proceedings, needs to be set out in a coherent form, if the trial was to be completed in the five days allotted.
	
	
	Mr Kalantzis, for the defendant, opposed the application on two main grounds. The first of these was that the preparation of statements was disproportionate (s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)) to the subject matter of these proceedings, and to the amounts of damages likely to be awarded to the plaintiffs. Additionally, the parties had been case-managed in the Supreme Court and no request for statements had been made at that time.
	
	
	Mr Kalantzis’s second argument was that the proceedings may never reach the stage of evidence, as the defendant has reserved his right to challenge the imputations at trial, as opposed to seeking a separate trial on capacity pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedural Rules 2005 (NSW). Mr Kalantzis submitted that the proceedings could well fail at the preliminary level of defamatory meaning, in which case there would be no point in having statements at all.
	


Use of statements in defamation proceedings


	
	While witness statements are commonly used in other court proceedings, these rules traditionally have not applied in defamation proceedings until relatively recently, although since the enactment of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) such applications are more common.
	
	
	The first problem is the lateness of the application. A similar application was made in Williams v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1242 Campbell J refused an application for witness statements brought two weeks before the trial. His Honour noted at [7] the competing issues of the efficiency provisions in ss 56 and 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), but concluded that “there is still something to be said for older methods” (at [10]). Ultimately, while noting the application as being finely balanced, the reasons for the rejection of an order for witness statements by Campbell J was the imminence of the trial (two weeks away), and the fact that it was a jury trial, neither of which is applicable here.
	
	
	Mr Kalantzis’s first argument of lack of proportionality falls away due to the length of the proceedings (five days) and the complexities of fact and law. Witness statements are of particular assistance in proceedings where the defendant is not a media organisation (PW v MS (No 3) [2014] WASC 202), as they reduce the hearing time as well as concentrate the attention of the parties on the issues at hand (Ives v State of Western Australia (No 7) [2013] WASC 62).
	
	
	This brings me to Mr Kalantzis’ second submission, namely that the defendant reserves his right to bring an application to challenge the imputations pleaded at the trial, and this could well result in judgment being entered for the defendant after a separate hearing as to capacity. This submission is, however, unrealistic. First, the general practice of bringing such applications at the hearing is not to be encouraged (Anderson v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (No 2) (1986) 5 NSWLR 735) other than in circumstances where the matter complained of is a slander. Second, even under the repealed legislation, challenges to the imputations at the trial were generally not heard as a preliminary issue for determination before the defences were determined: TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd v Mahony (1993) 32 NSWLR 397. While a party may retain a right to challenge an imputation on the basis of capacity at the trial (Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Hibbert [2015] NSWCA 13), whether this is permitted will be an issue for determination by the trial judge. Third, it seems unlikely that every imputation will be struck out, and if only one survives, then the defences will need to be considered, as well as issues of damages, even if the plaintiffs are ultimately unsuccessful.
	
	
	There is ample time before the hearing for the parties to exchange witness statements, and the inconvenience to the defendant of having to come to Sydney for the purpose of preparing his statement can be readily compensated for by the fact that a mediation has been arranged before an Assistant Registrar in this court. The defendant will have the benefit of attending the mediation in the full knowledge of the facts of the case as set out in the plaintiffs’ witness statements, and the opportunity to prepare his own statement, and those of his witnesses, following the mediation taking place, in the event that the proceedings do not settle at mediation.
	
	
	I note that the plaintiffs initially sought an order that the defendant should serve his statements first. That would amount to an order inverting the order of the trial (Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 28), which is not permissible.
	
	
	Accordingly I have made timetable orders for the exchange of statements but, to ensure that the defendant is not financially disadvantaged by having to come to Sydney for the purpose of preparation of the statements, I have timed the mediation to occur before he is obliged to put on his statements in reply.
	


Orders


	
	An order correcting details of the first plaintiff on JusticeLink from “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) INC” to “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales) Inc”.
	
	
	An order correcting details of the second plaintiff on JusticeLink from “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia Coffs Harbour Branch Inc” to “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales) Armidale Branch Inc”.
	
	
	An order correcting details of the third plaintiff on JusticeLink from “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales)” to “Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales) Coffs Harbour Branch Inc”.
	
	
	An order correcting details of the defendant on JusticeLink from “Keith Judge” to “Keith Edward Judge”.
	
	
	Plaintiffs’ witness statements by 25 September 2015.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 26 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the parties are directed to attend before an Assistant Registrar of this court for mediation on 30 September 2015.
	
	
	Defendant’s witness statements by 23 October 2015.
	
	
	Plaintiffs’ witness statements in reply (if any) 14 days after service of the defendant’s statements.
	
	
	Note the defendant reserves his rights to an imputation argument at the trial.
	
	
	Otherwise confirm the hearing date of 9 November 2015 (estimate 5 days).

		14 September 2015",2015-09-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702808,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Cacu [2015] NSWSC 1232,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Mr Cacu and Ms Kuzniatsova (or, where it is unnecessary to distinguish between them, the applicants), who are husband and wife seek a general stay of confiscation proceedings that were commenced against them under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. In the alternative, the applicants seek an order that the Court order a stay of orders made on 10 March 2015 relating to the provision of statements under s 39 of the Act and examinations under s 180 of the Act.
	
	
	On 10 March 2015, the Commissioner applied ex-parte for orders restraining various properties, cars and bank accounts of Mr Cacu and place certain of his property into the custody and control of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, and to provide the Commissioner with sworn statements concerning his property, liabilities and dispositions or dealings with property. The Commissioner also sought orders in respect of assets in the name of Ms Kuzniatsova which were suspected of being “subject to the effective control of [Mr Cacu]”. The application was supported by an affidavit of Mr Steven Daher, dated 10 March 2015, which deposed to suspicions held by him that Mr Cacu had committed a number of serious offences under ss 140(1) and 136(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) and ss 400.9(1) and 400.3(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). These offences involve allegations that Mr Cacu provided false or misleading information when opening and using a Westpac bank account, including the use of a false name, ‘Egan Coen’.
	
	
	On 11 March 2015, Federal Agents arrested Mr Cacu and charged him with offences substantially reflecting the suspicions of Mr Daher in his affidavit. (He was also charged with gun and drug offences which do not presently matter). On this date, the applicants were served with the orders made on 10 March 2015 by this Court.
	
	
	The applicants filed two notices of motion in this Court on 1 and 24 April 2015. By the first, they sought a stay of the orders requiring Mr Cacu to file sworn statements of financial information with the Commissioner until after the determination of the criminal proceedings faced by him. By the second, they sought a general stay of the proceedings until after Mr Cacu’s criminal proceedings had been determined. The applicants also sought an order for the return of a vehicle to Ms Kuzniatsova and an extension of time for them to challenge the restraining orders. Those orders have been dealt with and the only questions left concern whether to grant either a partial or general stay of these proceedings whilst the criminal charges remain to be tried.
	


The elements of the charges and the issues in the forfeiture case


	
	The affidavit of Mr Daher listed those matters which led to his suspicion that Mr Cacu had dealt with property having a value of over $100,000 which is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code. For the same reasons, Mr Daher suspected that Mr Cacu dealt with specified property worth over $1,000,000 which he believed was the proceeds of crime and/or intended it to be an instrument of crime, contrary to s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code. These reasons were that the various assets (real property, bank accounts and motor vehicles) sought to be forfeited involved the use of funds greatly disproportionate to that expected to be available from legitimate sources of income as declared by Mr Cacu and Ms Kuzniatsova in their yearly tax returns between 2007 and 2014; in respect of some of the assets suspected actually to belong to or controlled by Mr Cacu, Mr Cacu used the alias Egan Coen to acquire or operate them; in respect of bank accounts, actually Mr Cacu’s, the use of the alias; whilst in respect of those in his own name, they represented access to funds; and, in respect of accounts and motor vehicles in Ms Kuzniatsova’s name, they are under Mr Cacu’s control.
	
	
	It will be seen that the property in respect of which financial statements are sought and, ultimately examination is to occur, is property which is alleged to have been dealt with in a manner that constitutes the specified criminal offences.
	


The orders authorised by the Act


	
	The financial statements were ordered to be provided under s 39A(1) of the Act –
	


“(1) The court that made a restraining order, or any other court that could have made the restraining order, may make any ancillary orders that the court considers appropriate and, without limiting the generality of this, the court may make any one or more of the following orders:

…

(ca) an order directing the suspect in relation to the restraining order to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out all of his or her interests in property, and his or her liabilities;

(d) an order directing the owner or a previous owner … to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property;

(da) if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person (other than the owner or a previous owner) has information relevant to identifying, locating or quantifying the property – an order directing the person to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property”

Orders


	
	The orders obtained by the Commissioner included orders restraining specified property of the applicants (orders 6, 7 and 8), orders restraining unspecified property held in the name and known alias of Mr Cacu (order 9), orders granting custody and control of specified property to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (orders 10, 11 and 12), orders requiring Mr Cacu to provide the Commissioner with sworn statements of financial information (orders 13 and 14) as also Ms Kuzniatsova (orders 15 and 16) and orders requiring Mr Cacu to obtain bank statements from a Turkish bank account said to be in his name and to transfer funds in that account to the account of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (orders 17 and 18).
	
	
	Those presently in issue are –
	


“[13] Pursuant to section 39(1)(ca) of the … Act, Ergun Cacu is directed to give to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or his nominated delegate within 28 days of the date of service of these orders a sworn statement, in the form set out in Schedule Four to these orders setting out:

a. all of his interests in property within the meaning of the Act, worldwide, not including any asset or interest in property with a value of less than AUD5.000 as at the date of these orders; and

b. all of his liabilities, worldwide, not including any liability with a value of less than AUD5,000 as at the date of these orders.

[14] Pursuant to section 39(1)(d) of the Act, an order directing Ergun Cacu to give a sworn statement to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or his nominated delegate no later than 28 days after being notified of the making of the order setting out particulars of or dealings with the property specified in Schedules One and Two.

[15] Pursuant to section 39(1)(d) of the Act, an order directing Sofya Kuzniatsova to give a sworn statement to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or his nominated delegate no later than 28 days after being notified of the making of the order setting out particulars of or dealings with the property of Ergun Cacu with a value of AUD10,000 or greater.

[16] Pursuant to section 39(1)(da) of the Act, an order directing Sofya Kuzniatsova to give a sworn statement to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or his nominated delegate no later than 28 days after being notified of the making of the order setting out particulars of or dealings with the property of Ergun Cacu with a value of AUD 10,000 or greater.”


	
	Schedule Four sets out the form of the sworn statement required under order 13 and requires the provision of particulars concerning the nature and extent of all assets and liabilities, including the names of persons or institutions having custody of title documents, the dates of acquisition, the amounts and dates of payments in discharge of any liability in relation to property and the source of any such payments, the identity of any creditor, full particulars of dealings with property since 15 May 2009 as well as the property, liabilities and dealings of companies of which Mr Cacu is a director. In substance, the order requires Mr Cacu to disclose the entirety of his financial position to the Commissioner. The requirement to disclose sources of payments is somewhat uncertain in scope: at its narrowest, it would simply require identification of the provider of the funds to Mr Cacu (e.g. the bank account from which they were paid); at its widest, the mode (even if criminal, say by drug dealing) by which he acquired the funds to make the payments would have to be disclosed. It seems to me that this latter construction is the correct one. Orders for examination of the applicants were also made.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicants submit, firstly, that Mr Cacu should not be placed in a position where he must decide whether to prejudice his criminal trial or his defence of the forfeiture proceedings. In the event that these proceedings are not stayed, the issue would arise concerning the impact of the compulsory financial statements and examination on the fairness of his trial of the criminal charges. Reliance was placed on Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhao [2015] HCA 5; 89 ALJR 331, in which the High Court upheld an order staying, until the conclusion of cognate current criminal proceedings, confiscation proceedings brought by the Commissioner. The proceedings had moved to the point that it was necessary to make an exclusion application in order to prevent automatic forfeiture (see ss 19 and 49 of the Act) with the practical consequence that Zhao would have to put on evidence dealing with the issue whether the property was the proceeds of crime or not, the very issue that was the subject of the criminal trial. Hence his need for a stay to avoid prejudicing the fairness of his trial. The applicants contend, as did the second respondent in Zhao that, as Mr Cacu faces pending criminal proceedings concerning allegations that grounded the confiscation proceedings, the issues in the confiscation and the criminal proceedings are “substantially identical”, and he is able to point to the risk of prejudice to his criminal proceedings if required to defend himself in the confiscation proceedings. In Mr Cacu’s affidavit he asserted that the risk of prejudice arises from his ability to defend the confiscation proceedings while the related criminal proceedings remain on foot. In particular, “There are material matters that I would like to advance in defence of the confiscation proceeding. These matters are substantially similar to the matters that I would like to put forward in response to the criminal charges”. Mr Cacu also contended that, in complying with orders 13 and 14, which require him to provide written statements concerning his properties and liabilities, he would need to provide evidence that “would be directly relevant to the criminal charges”. He also deposed to his fear that his answers in the sworn statements might lead police or prosecuting authorities to “conduct further investigations directed at obtaining admissible evidence to prove those matters in my criminal proceeding”. He said that, if the confiscation proceedings continue throughout the criminal proceedings against him, he would be “forced from time to time to make difficult judgements about the extent to which I should waive my right to silence in order to lead evidence to counter the plaintiff’s allegations in the confiscation proceeding”.
	
	
	The Commissioner submitted that Zhao concerned the pursuit of forfeiture proceedings to a hearing before the relevant criminal proceedings had concluded against the accused, whilst here it has not yet sought forfeiture and does not plan to do so until after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings and, accordingly Zhao is irrelevant. The point of the orders requiring the statements is to identify assets that might be restrained and enable consideration to be given to whether they should be restrained and protected from dissipation. The plaintiff submitted that an order staying the entire proceedings would undermine the principal objects of the legislation, specified in s 5 as including “to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to trace proceeds” of crime and confiscate them. The Commissioner contended this purpose would be thwarted if the currency of criminal proceedings having a factual overlap with the confiscation proceedings (which will almost always exist) provided a basis for staying the latter, including preventing or, at least, substantially delaying the necessary ancillary processes of requiring financial statements and conducting examinations. The Commissioner pointed to s 319 of the Act as demonstrating that the legislature contemplated that criminal and civil proceedings might run concurrently and thus, as stated in Zhao at [30] –
	


“[Mr Cacu, although charged] … with an offence which is relevant to forfeiture or other civil proceedings brought under the … Act must do more than point to the existence of criminal proceedings in order to obtain a stay of the civil proceedings.”


	
	The Commissioner relied on Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196; 235 A Crim R 326 (Lee 1), in which the High Court allowed an accused to be examined under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (CAR Act) on subject matters related to pending criminal charges because the legislation (submitted to be analogous to the Act) provided adequate safeguards against any risk of prejudice that might arise from the overlap in proceedings. In the context of this case, the Commissioner submitted that, although information from financial statements and the examination can be shared, it is inadmissible against Mr Cacu in any criminal proceedings. Furthermore any sharing – if it occurred – would need to be carefully undertaken to avoid the risk of the trial miscarrying as occurred in Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 237 A Crim R 436; 88 ALJR 656 (Lee 2) where transcripts of the appellant’s evidence before the Commission were published to the Director of Public Prosecutions and available to the prosecutors.
	


The cases


	
	In Zhao the Court stated (omitting references) –
	


“Whether a stay should have been granted

[43] The risk of prejudice to the second respondent if a stay is not granted in the forfeiture proceedings and the exclusion proceedings is plain. It is not necessary for the second respondent to say any more than he did on the application for a stay in order to identify that risk, given that the offences and the circumstances relevant to both proceedings are substantially identical.

[43] The Commissioner contends, as the primary judge had held, that it was necessary that the second respondent state the specific matters of prejudice before a stay could be contemplated. However, to require the second respondent to do so would be to make the risk of prejudice a reality by requiring him to reveal information about his defence, the very situation which an order for a stay seeks to avoid. Similarly, the Commissioner's contention that the court should defer making an order for a stay until the parties have exchanged their evidence is beside the point.

[44] The Commissioner suggests that protective orders could be made, which might maintain the confidentiality of evidence, and that evidence could be given in closed court. In the latter regard, the open court principle, to which the law adheres… now finds expression in s 28 of the Open Courts Act 2013 (Vic). The rationale of the open court principle is that court proceedings should be subjected to public and professional scrutiny, and courts will not act contrary to the principle save in exceptional circumstances. Closing the court so that the Commissioner might progress forfeiture proceedings and receive the second respondent's evidence does not qualify as a proper reason for departing from the principle.

[45] During the course of argument, at a point when the power given by s 266A of the… Act to disclose to a prosecutor evidence obtained by compulsion was mentioned, the Commissioner was at pains to reassure the Court that he does not contend that s 266A provides a licence to communicate information obtained in the civil proceedings to the prosecuting authorities. The Commissioner emphasised that the Proceeds of Crime Litigation section is not regarded as an arm of the prosecution, which appears to have been the perception of the New South Wales Crime Commission in Lee No 2.

[46] Regardless of the conduct in Lee No 2, it would not be correct to approach a matter such as this on the basis that a wrong would be committed. However, s 266A would not render the provision of the second respondent's evidence to the prosecution unlawful. Even if it could not be used as evidence against him, its possession by the prosecution might affect his defence. The Court of Appeal's view, that protective orders would not suffice to remove the risk of prejudice to the second respondent's defence, is clearly correct.

[47] The prospect that civil proceedings may prejudice a criminal trial and that such prejudice may require a stay of the civil proceedings is hardly novel. In some jurisdictions, procedures are provided for making an application for a stay in such circumstances... The risk of prejudice in a case such as this is real. The second respondent can point to a risk of prejudice; the Commissioner cannot.”


	
	The submission of the Commissioner as to the generality of the basis for the applicant’s contention that Mr Cacu’s fair trial will be prejudiced is answered, as it seems to me, by the fact (not really contested) that “the offences and the circumstances relevant to both proceedings are substantially identical”: see Zhao at [42], set out above. Requiring Mr Cacu, in effect, to admit (or deny) his ownership or control of the assets which are the subject of the Criminal Code offences will constitute a breach of the “important aspect of a criminal trial which follows from a fundamental principle of the common law … that the prosecution is to prove the guilt of an accused person charged with a crime and cannot compel a person charged with a crime to assist in the discharge of its onus of proof”: Zhao at [18]. This principle is acknowledged by the presence of s 198. However, the use of the statements to obtain derivative evidence is not prohibited and such derivative evidence would be admissible in his trial to support, if it happened to do so, the prosecution case or provide the basis for other charges.
	
	
	The starting point of the recent jurisprudence concerning the significance of the intersection between executive compulsory investigation and criminal trials dealing with the same person and overlapping factual issues is Hammond v The Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188, where the plaintiff, who had been charged with criminal offences, was liable to be questioned about those matters by a Royal Commission. It was accepted that, if there were a real risk, as opposed to a remote possibility, that the administration of justice would be interfered with if the proposed examination occurred, it would constitute a contempt of court and the examination must be adjourned until the conclusion of the trial. In finding there was such a risk Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason J agreed) said (at 198) that the proposed examination was “very likely to prejudice… [Hammond] in his defence”. Brennan J, coming to the same conclusion, said (at 202) that, although the source of the immunity against self-incrimination may be debateable, “it is sufficient for present purposes to appreciate that it is a principle deep-rooted in our law and history that the Crown may not subject an accused person to compulsory process to obtain his answers upon the issue of his guilt of an offence with which he has been charged”. Deane J, (who proposed a wider restraint than Gibbs CJ and Brennan J) described it (at 208) as –
	


“… fundamental to the administration of criminal justice that a person who is the subject of pending criminal proceedings in a court of law should not be subjected to having his part in the matters involved in those criminal proceedings made the subject of a parallel inquisitorial inquiry by an administrative tribunal with powers to compel the giving of evidence and the production of documents which largely correspond (and, to some extent, exceed) the powers of the criminal court. Such an extracurial inquisitorial investigation of the involvement of a person who has been committed for trial in the matters which form the basis of the criminal proceedings against him constitutes, in my view, an improper interference with the due administration of justice in the proceedings against him in the criminal court and contempt of court.”


	
	In X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92; 232 A Crim R 410, a majority of the High Court held that the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) did not authorise the examination by the Commission of a charged person in respect of matters which were the subject of the charges. Hayne and Bell JJ described the impact on the process of criminal justice of the proposed construction as follows –
	


“[124] Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.

[125] As has been explained, if an alteration of that kind is to be made to the criminal justice system by statute, it must be made clearly by express words or by necessary intendment. If the relevant statute does not provide clearly for an alteration of that kind, compelling answers to questions about the subject matter of the pending charge would be a contempt.”


	
	In their dissenting judgment, French CJ and Crennan J concluded that the specific provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act contemplated the conduct of an examination of a person charged with an offence and made specific provision as to the use and disclosure that might be made of material elicited relevant to the subject matter of the offence, making specific reference to the risk of prejudicing the fair trial of the accused (at [25]-[26]). That Act reflected “a legislative judgment” that gave priority to the investigative functions of the Commission over the “private interest in claiming the privilege against self-incrimination” (at [29]).
	
	
	The problem in Lee 1 concerned the exercise of the power to order an examination by a registrar of the court of defendants under s 31D of the CAR Act, which was likely to concern conduct in respect of the relevant property that would impinge upon offences with which they were also charged. (I interpolate that examinations under the Act are not conducted by the registrar but by a person prescribed by the regulations: s 183. Although such a person may have judicial or quasi-judicial status (see regulation 12, supra), in no sense are they acting judicially.) French CJ (omitting some references) observed –
	


“[1] The presumption of innocence, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence are important elements of the ‘accusatorial system of justice’ which generally prevails in the common law world.”

Furthermore –

“[54] It may be accepted that the examination process under the CAR Act may, if it touches upon matters the subject of pending criminal charges against the examinee, affect the accusatorial character of the trial process. Even if the responses of the examinee to questions put to him or her were kept secret and were solely exculpatory or did no more than disclose defences to the charges, the examinee could be said to have suffered a forensic disadvantage. The nature of that disadvantage was discussed in the joint judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 [(2013) 248 CLR 92 at 142-143 [124]]. I do not, with respect, disagree with anything their Honours said in the description of that disadvantage.”

His Honour emphasised (at [24]) the fundamental character of the privilege against self-incrimination which, though “not an essential element of the process of trial by jury”, is “a basic and substantive common law right” (citing X7 at [104] per Hayne and Bell JJ) that “supports the presumption of innocence”. It followed from its fundamental importance that any qualification by statute must be justified by strict construction of the statutory language, taking into account the legislative purpose as well as text and context (at [29]). Nevertheless, s 31D of the CAR Act authorised the making of an order for examination of a person charged with an offence about matters relevant to the offence, leaving the Court with a discretion to refuse to make such an order (at [4]) as the examination was a judicial process carried out “before the Court, or before an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court”, with all its powers to supervise and control its own processes including “the power to take appropriate action to prevent injustice” or diminish or prevent prejudice beyond that authorised by the CAR Act (at [40]-[41]). This distinguished the case from that in Hammond (at [36]) and in X7 (at [47]). A further point was that, as distinct from this position, it would be inapposite to analyse the power of compulsory examination conferred on a court “by reference to whether the court is authorised to do that which would otherwise be a contempt of court” (at [48]).


	
	The following matters were, according to the Chief Justice, determinative –
	


“[55] …

● the objects of the CAR Act, which expressly contemplate its application to persons facing criminal charges;

● the application of the substantive proceedings under the CAR Act to persons facing such charges;

● the premises upon which the former s 62 and s 63 were framed, which contemplate the conduct of proceedings touching matters the subject of pending charges;

● the character of the examination under s 31D as ancillary to substantive confiscation proceedings under the CAR Act;

● the conferring of a power to make an order for an examination on the Supreme Court and the conferring of the examination power itself on the Court;

● the capacity of the Court to exercise its discretion to make or decline to make an examination order and to make directions affecting the conduct of any examination.”


	
	In dissent (with Kiefel and Bell JJ), Hayne J concluded that the power given to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, by s 31D(1) of the CAR Act, to order the examination on oath of a person “concerning the affairs of the affected person” did not permit the Court to order the examination of a person charged with, but not yet tried for, an offence about the subject matter of the pending charge since the loss of the privilege against self-incrimination would work “a fundamental alteration to the accusatorial process of criminal justice” which the general language of the section did not envisage (at [59]-[60]). His Honour considered that the question had been decided by X7, which had applied “fundamental and generally applicable principles of very long standing” (at [71]). Furthermore –
	


“[74] No less importantly, the effect on the accusatorial process cannot be measured by confining attention to issues of self-incrimination. The accusatorial process of criminal justice represents the balance that is struck between the power of the state and the individual in the prosecution of crime. The particular balance that is struck requires that the state formulate the charge that is to be prosecuted and then prove every element of that charge, beyond reasonable doubt, without the accused being required to make any answer to the charge at any stage of the process.”


	
	His Honour mentioned and dismissed the significance of the lack of a distinction drawn in s 31D between the commencement or otherwise of criminal proceedings and continued (omitting references) –
	


“[76] Similarly, the relevant question is neither addressed nor answered by asserting that s 63 of the CAR Act confirms that the CAR Act has adverted to the possibility of concurrence between proceedings under s 31D(1)(a) and criminal proceedings against the person being examined. Section 63 provides that:

‘The fact that criminal proceedings have been instituted or have commenced (whether or not under this Act) is not a ground on which the Supreme Court may stay proceedings under this Act that are not criminal proceedings.’

The generality of the words of s 63 presents the same question for consideration as s 31D(1). Do the general words used in the provision extend to the particular case of examination of a person charged with, but not yet tried for, an offence about the subject matter of the pending charge? Section 63 does not answer this question unless it is first assumed that it must. Yet that is the very issue to be determined. It must be recalled that, but for s 63, there may have been lively debate about whether the pendency of criminal charges against any person permitted or required an order staying civil proceedings touching upon issues that may arise at a criminal trial … Section 63, therefore, has evident work to do without assuming that its general words mean that the CAR Act works a fundamental alteration to the process of criminal justice.”


	
	Hayne J articulated the general principle as follows (omitting most references) –
	


“[79] The asking of questions and the compelling of answers about the pending charge inevitably interfere with the conduct of an accusatorial trial and embarrass the defence of the accused. The answers the accused has been compelled to give to the questions asked deprive the accused of forensic choices that otherwise would be legitimately open at trial to test the case which the prosecution advances. That is, the asking of questions about the pending charge and the compelling of answers to those questions work a fundamental alteration to the accusatorial process of criminal justice.

[80] It is theoretically possible that, at the end of a trial, it may be said that the deprivation of those choices was anodyne in its practical effect. But that is not to the point. The issue is presented when it is sought to conduct the examination. The examination occurs before the trial has begun.

[81] No doubt, it is important to notice that an examination under s 31D(1) was to be conducted before the Supreme Court or an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court. It is to be assumed that the Court or its officer would act to prevent oppression of the person being examined and would act to prevent misuse or abuse of the process of examination, whether by limiting or precluding publication of what transpires at the examination, or otherwise. But if the trial of the person being examined is pending, the Court (or the officer of the Court) cannot know, and cannot predict, what might harm the defence of that person at trial. Those matters are unknown to, and unknowable by, the Court (or its officer) for the simple reason that the Court (or its officer) does not know, and cannot be told, what are or will be the accused's instructions to his or her lawyers at trial.

[82] To suggest that preserving the legitimate forensic choices that are open to an accused at a criminal trial would permit, let alone encourage, the pursuit of falsehood misstates the fundamental character of a criminal trial. Reference to the pursuit of falsehood may suggest that a criminal trial is an inquisition into the truth of the allegation made. It is not … Subject to the rules of evidence, fairness and admissibility, each of the prosecution and the accused is free to decide the ground on which to contest the issue, the evidence to be called and the questions to be asked. Reference to the pursuit of falsehood may suggest that legitimately testing the strength of the prosecution's proof is somehow dishonest. It is not.

[83] Accepting either suggestion would set at nought the fundamental principle stated by this Court, nearly 80 years ago, in Tuckiar v The King (1934) 52 CLR 335 at 346, that counsel for an accused has ""a plain duty, both to his [or her] client and to the Court, to press such rational considerations as the evidence fairly [gives] rise to in favour of complete acquittal"" or conviction of a lesser charge. That ‘plain duty’ arises because, whether an accused ‘be in fact guilty or not, [the accused] is, in point of law, entitled to acquittal from any charge which the evidence fails to establish that he [or she] committed’ … [52 CLR at 346] (emphasis added).

[84] The accusatorial process of criminal justice reflects the balance that is struck between the power of the state and the place of the individual. Legislative alteration to that balance may not be made without clear words or necessary intendment.”


	
	Crennan J (in the majority), following a review of the CAR Act, focused on the purpose of the ancillary powers given to the court to make orders facilitating the “objects of identifying and recovering property sourced from serious crime related activity” of which examining the defendant was one and noted that delaying an examination until criminal proceedings instituted against the defendant were completed could frustrate these objects (at [131]). The power to order examination and require answers to incriminatory questions is not expressed to be limited by the currency of criminal proceedings and that there is no such limit is indicated by the grant of direct use immunity (at [133]). The allowing of derivative use in criminal proceedings did not oust generally applicable rules as to admissibility and the examinee is protected “against any such derivative use by requiring that the examination take place before the Supreme Court, or an officer of the Court, having in addition to the [power to restrict publication]…, the inherent power to ensure the proper administration of justice”: at [137] quoting Meagher JA in the Court of Appeal in New South Wales Crime Commission v Lee [2012] NSWCA 276; 84 NSWLR 1 at 23-24 [99]. The CAR Act –
	


“[141] … confers on the Supreme Court powers to be exercised judicially, in accordance with legal principle, and so as to diminish the possibility of oppression and injustice in any examination … The Court, controlling an examination, has the power to conduct the examination in private, to adjourn and resume the examination, to disallow questions designed to establish the examinee's guilt or to elicit defences in respect of pending criminal charges, to make orders restricting publication of the examination or related information, and (other than restoring the abrogated privilege) to make such other orders as are necessary to safeguard an examinee's fair trial.”


	
	It is clear that, as with French CJ, Crennan J’s view of the reach of s 31D rested significantly, indeed decisively, upon the continuing powers of the Court to ensure that the procedures authorised by the CAR Act did not result in an unfair trial. Thus, that s 63 deprives a defendant subject to pending criminal proceedings of an entitlement to have civil proceedings (envisaged by the CAR Act) stayed did “not operate to override the Supreme Court’s ‘undoubted power to stay a criminal proceeding which will result in an unfair trial’: Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; 177 CLR 292 at 298 per Mason CJ and McHugh J; see also at 332 per Deane J…” (at [143]). Thus “consideration of whether an order for examination might prejudice the fair trial of a person proposed to be examined is relevant not only to the exercise of discretion under s 31D(1)(a) to order an examination, but also to the subsequent conduct of any examination in the Supreme Court” (at [145]).
	
	
	Kiefel J, having mentioned the abrogation by s13A(1) of the CAR Act of the common law privilege against self-incrimination (at [158]), pointed out (citing X7) –
	


“[159] … [the] common law principle that the prosecution cannot compel a person accused of a crime to assist in the discharge of its onus of proof. This is an essential aspect of an accusatorial system and is fundamental to the common law. It lies at the heart of the system of criminal justice administered by the courts ...”

Her Honour noted the virtual certainty that the evidence obtained in an examination would be passed on to investigators and the prosecution, which would lead –

“[163] … [to the] real risk, if not a likelihood, that aspects of the appellants' trials will differ from a criminal trial as it is ordinarily conducted, especially in its accusatorial aspects. Rather than the prosecution being required to prove its case without assistance from the appellants, the examination is likely to result in the prosecution being advantaged in the conduct of its case and the appellants prejudiced.”

The extent and efficacy of the Court’s inherent powers to prevent “obstruction to the administration of criminal justice”, such as limiting the publication of information or requiring the examination to be conducted in private and preventing a contempt are relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 31D but not to the construction of the CAR Act (at [164]). Her Honour pointed out (at [170]) that, in X7, the majority of the High Court held that the Australian Crime Commission Act did not authorise the examination of a person about an offence with which he or she had been charged. This construction depended on the significance of the fundamental principle of the criminal law, reflective of the presumption of innocence, that the onus is on the prosecution to prove an accused’s guilt (at [174]) and cannot compel the accused to give evidence for it, which is “an essential aspect of the criminal trial in our system of criminal justice” (at [176]). The question is “whether the statute in question clearly intends to alter that system and that principle”. Importantly, the privilege against self-incrimination “is not to be equated with the inability to compel an accused person to give evidence. The privilege may be lost but the fundamental principle of the accusatorial system of criminal justice remains” (at [182]). Referring to the reasoning of Gibbs CJ, in Hammond v The Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188 at 198 and Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 at 294, Kiefel J observed (at [210]) that “the use of material obtained as a result of a compulsory examination is but one aspect of the risk of interference with the criminal trial … [with] more at stake than merely the loss of the privilege” since the defendant is very likely to be prejudiced “in his defence”. The prosecution might be “forewarned of defences and explanations, that are not otherwise apparent, being provided of transactions” (R v Seller [2013] NSWCCA 42; 273 FLR 155 at 183-184 [104] per Bathurst CJ where, at first instance it was also noted that the information might assist “the prosecution in preparing its witness statements and presenting its case”). Accordingly –

“[211] It is likely that the prosecution will be advantaged at trial by the examination of the appellants in a way for which the system of criminal justice would not otherwise provide. The attainment of such an advantage through the exercise of statutory powers may in itself amount to an interference with the administration of justice … Such an advantage may, to an extent, correspond with the prejudice caused to an accused person. It may be more extensive. But … it was not the advantage gained by the prosecution which was identified in Hammond to follow ‘inescapably’ … [152 CLR at 198] from an examination of a person charged with an offence about that offence. The interference, and thus the contempt, identified by Gibbs CJ in Hammond lay in the fact that if Mr Hammond were examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, he was likely to be prejudiced in his defence … ""because he could no longer determine the course he would follow at his trial according only to the strength of the case that the prosecution proposed to, and did, adduce in support of its case that the offence charged was proved beyond reasonable doubt’ … [X7 (2013) 248 CLR 92 at 146].

[212] What was identified in Hammond was not the loss of some forensic advantage in an accused person. In any event, to describe the effects of an examination for an accused person in this way tends to trivialise both them and the fundamental principle in its practical operation. The choices open to an accused person with respect to the conduct of that person's defence result from the requirement of the fundamental principle that the prosecution prove its case. It is therefore not correct to cast doubt upon the importance of those choices or whether the accused should be entitled to them. Neither Hammond nor the cases preceding it considered the prejudice occasioned to an accused to be insubstantial.”

Kiefel J concluded (at [213] and [253]), following X7, that by merely abrogating the privilege against self-incrimination, the CAR Act did not effect such a fundamental change in the administration of criminal justice as would authorise the examination of a person then charged with a criminal offence.


	
	Bell J agreed with the judgment of Kiefel J, in her additional remarks emphasising the direct relevance of X7 in disposing of the Commission’s argument that the CAR Act authorised “the compulsory examination of a person about the subject matter of a charged offence” or, if not, “the Registrar conducting the examination would not permit [such] questioning” (at [255] and [258]). “A real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with” (vide Hammond 152 CLR at 198 per Gibbs CJ) arises not merely from “the conferral of an advantage on the prosecution that the rules of procedure would otherwise deny” but, “as X7 explains, the compulsory examination would … [deprive the accused] of forensic choices legitimately available” by substantially reducing “the areas in which the prosecution case may be tested in accordance with counsel’s obligations” (at [264]-[265]). “[T]he assumption upon which our adversarial system of criminal justice proceeds … [is] that the accused is entitled to be acquitted of a charge of criminal wrongdoing unless unaided by him or her the prosecution proves guilt” (at [266], emphasis in original).
	
	
	Gageler and Keane JJ both concluded that the CAR Act authorised an order for examination of a person accused of criminal offences about matters relevant to the offences and that this overlap was not a basis for the Court to refuse to make the order (at [268]-[269]). In respect of Hammond and X7, their Honours said (omitting some references) –
	


“[322] Hammond is illustrative of the proposition that a real risk to the administration of justice can arise where there is a real risk that the practical consequence of an exercise of a coercive statutory power would be to give to the prosecution in criminal proceedings ‘advantages which the rules of procedure would otherwise deny’... Hammond is not authority for the proposition that a real risk to the administration of justice necessarily, or presumptively, arises by reason only of the exercise of a statutory power to compel the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced but not completed where the subject matter of the examination will overlap with the subject matter of the proceedings. The majority in X7 does not appear to us to have embraced such a proposition.

[323] There is a variety of ways in which, as a matter of practical reality, the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced may have a tendency to give rise to unfairness amounting to an interference with the due course of justice in a particular case. The deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice available to the person in those proceedings may be one of those ways. However, we are unable to regard as the deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice a practical constraint on the legal representatives of the person leading evidence or cross-examining or making submissions in the criminal proceedings to suggest a version of the facts which contradicted that given by their client on oath in the examination. The legal representatives would, of course, be prevented from setting up an affirmative case inconsistent with the evidence but they would not be prevented from ensuring that the prosecution is put to proof or from arguing that the evidence as a whole does not prove guilt…

[324] The notion that any subtraction, however anodyne it might be in its practical effect, from the forensic advantages enjoyed by an accused under the general law necessarily involves an interference with the administration of justice or prejudice to the fair trial of the accused is unsound in principle and is not consistent with Hamilton v Oades. To accept that a criminal trial ""does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means"" (R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38; (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 576; [1984] HCA 38 is not to condone as legitimate the pursuit of falsehood. The words of Lord Scarman in R v Sang [1979] UKHL 3; [1980] AC 402 at 456 concerning the judicial discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence on the ground of unfairness, resonate more widely:

‘The test of unfairness is not that of a game: it is whether ... the evidence, if admitted, would undermine the justice of the trial. Any closer definition would fetter the sense of justice, upon which in the last resort all judges have to rely: but any extension of the discretion ... would also undermine the justice of the trial. For the conviction of the guilty is a public interest, as is the acquittal of the innocent. In a just society both are needed.’”


	
	The function of the examination was to permit inquiry about matters pertinent to the CAR Act proceedings and any other purpose, such as whether to charge the defendant with offences or assist the conduct of pending criminal proceedings, would be improper (at [327]).  But, in pursuit of property in which an “affected person” has an interest, the scope of the examination –
	


“[330] … extends to anything done by the person that was a serious criminal offence at the time it was done irrespective of whether the person has been charged with the offence and irrespective of whether the person, if charged, has been tried for the offence.”

A real risk of interference with the fair trial of a person to be examined is not permitted but mere overlap of subject matters gives rise to no more than the possibility of such interference because of the ability of the Court or its officer conducting the examination “to control the course of questioning and to make suppression or non-publication orders limiting the timing and scope of any use or dissemination by the Commission of answers given or documents produced” (at [340]).


	
	Although it dealt with a different situation to that with which I am faced, I should mention X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273, in which the Court (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hidden, Fullerton, R A Hulme JJ agreeing) found that, although the disclosure of X7’s evidence to those conducting the prosecution of his trial had been a breach of the requirements of the examiner’s direction made under s 25A(9) of the Australian Crime Commission Act, a permanent stay of the trial was not justified when a new prosecution team was briefed and was not given the interdicted material. A temporary stay of the examination proceedings until after an impending trial, justified by the interference with the proper processes of the administration of criminal justice and not dependent on any demonstrable practical prejudice was fundamentally different from a permanent stay, which is not only rarely granted, but required the identification of a fundamental defect in fact, as distinct from potentially, having unfair or unjustifiably oppressive consequences incapable of corrective action by the trial judge or else brought the administration of justice into disrepute (Bathurst CJ at [90]-[92]). His Honour pointed out (at [105]), after reviewing the decisions (amongst others) mentioned above, that the judgments (including of those in dissent), particularly in X7, concerned the significance of the essentially agreed position that the examination procedures authorised by the legislation in question fundamentally altered the accusatorial judicial process (the question being whether the legislation permitted this alteration and to what extent) and thus were concerned with the requirement that the trial comply with the law rather than with the question of fairness.
	
	
	In Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 888 Button J declined to make orders under s 180 of the Act for the examination of several persons (the respondents) until the criminal trial then pending against them had concluded. (Publication of the judgment is restricted because of pending criminal trials. However, it will not be necessary to do more than refer to the legal principles applied by his Honour, which will not disclose any identifying material.) Following their arrests on drug importation charges, a search of certain premises linked with one of the respondents located drugs and cash. Ultimately they were charged with importing prohibited substances and dealing with property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). The Commissioner commenced proceedings seeking, inter alia, orders for the examination of the respondents about their affairs which, it was not contested, would include the subject matter of their impending trial. The respondents relied, inter alia, on Zhao. The Commissioner sought to distinguish Zhao on the same basis as has been argued before me, namely that it concerned Pt 2.2 of the Act dealing with forfeiture applications and concomitant exclusion orders whilst the instant application (as here) concerned, inter alia, examinations under Pt 3.1. In the latter situation, the privilege against self-incrimination was specifically abrogated, though with direct use immunity (as with the compulsory financial statements) and the proceedings conducted in private, whilst in the former, the hearings were in public and the privilege was not abrogated; furthermore, examinations are directed to serving the fundamental purpose of the Act by enabling the authorities to locate assets that might be subject to forfeiture.
	
	
	Button J, as I have mentioned, in effect decided to delay the making of the examination orders until the trial was completed. Starting from the obvious facts that the examinations would deal with the cash discovered during the search and that the evidence as to the finding of that cash would be relied on in support of all the charges, his Honour also thought that answers to questions about other moneys could well lead to the discovery of other relevant evidence that would be tendered in the respondents’ trial, since there was no derivative use immunity available. Compulsory disclosure of the entirety of their financial affairs shortly before their trial argued, his Honour considered, for postponement of the examination until after the trial had concluded (ibid at [46]-[47]). His Honour noted, however, (at [48]) the provisions of the Act as to immunity, which did not exclude derivative use, and to the effect that the mere fact of pending criminal proceedings was not a basis for a stay of proceedings under the Act, as I understand his Honour, demonstrated that the problem of overlap had been considered by Parliament and needed to be considered in light of the purpose of the Act to identify, restrain and, ultimately, expropriate tainted property. At the same time, this did not mean that the Court was necessarily precluded from postponing the examination in the circumstances of the case (at [51)]. Although the objects of the Act would be thwarted during the time of any postponement, his Honour considered that there would be no “practical prejudice” since the cash founding the proceedings was in the control of the Commissioner and any further dishonest or illegal dealing with their financial affairs would have been ended with their arrest and incarceration (at [51]-[52]). The legislation does not prohibit the Court from ensuring, to the extent it is able (consistent with the Act), that the pending trial will be conducted consistently with the fundamental characteristics applying in Australia to criminal proceedings, as described in recent decisions of the High Court of Australia, amongst others, X7, Lee 1 and Zhao (at [55]-[56]).
	
	
	Button J rejected the Commissioner’s submission that Zhao, in particular, was distinguishable because it concerned the postponement of a forfeiture and exclusion hearing until after the pending trial dealing with the same subject matter. His Honour considered that its reasoning applied with “more force here” because it dealt with the situation where the accused had a choice about giving evidence as distinct with what his Honour was considering, where the accused were to be compelled to give evidence in their examination (at [58]). The mere fact that the Act abrogated direct use immunity and not derivative use immunity so far as examinations are concerned and left the forfeiture and exclusion hearings unaffected (because compulsion was not involved) did not suggest a legislative intent to discriminate between the two procedures (as I understand his Honour) for the purpose of considering whether the Court’s discretion to ensure that the overlapping criminal trial was undertaken in accordance with fundamental principles (at [59]-[60]).
	
	
	Accordingly, Button J considered he should adopt the approach of the Victorian Court of Appeal, which was unanimously upheld by the High Court in Zhao, and postpone the proposed examinations until after the conclusion of the trial.
	
	
	At [63]-[67], Button J pointed out, in respect of Lee 1, that, although Gageler and Keane JJ were of the view both that the Court had power to order an examination as to overlapping subject matter with a pending trial and no discretion to refuse to do so, both the Chief Justice (explicitly at [49] and [51]) and Crennan J (implicitly at [141]) considered that such a discretion survived, pointing out, at all events that the appeal concerned only the power of the Court to order examinations and not whether the discretion to do so had miscarried. Furthermore, the majority emphasised the significance of the fact that the examination was to be conducted before a Registrar of the Court, which is not the case under the Act.
	
	
	More generally, his Honour noted (at [68]) that s 180 of the Act itself is permissive and not mandatory, providing for the exercise of the judicial discretion. Whilst the mere fact of pending criminal proceedings does not prevent an examination (s 186(4)) or justify a stay (s 319), adjournments are not prohibited (at [70]).
	
	
	This reasoning applies here in respect of the examination but, in substance, an order delaying the requirement to provide financial statements would amount to a stay. Where, however, the circumstances in a particular case demonstrate the intersection to a significant degree of the issues in the pending trial and those raised or agitated by the compulsory procedures and create the substantial risk that the trial will be unfair in the sense that fundamental principles of criminal justice will be significantly qualified, a great deal more is involved than the mere coincidence of proceedings, which s 319 states is not a ground for a stay.
	


Discussion


	
	The above review of the authorities shows, as it seems to me, that requiring an accused person to assist the Crown in its prosecution of him or her is a substantial departure from the fundamental character of the process of a criminal trial which, unless authorised by statute, would result in the accused being denied a trial according to law. It is not disputed in this case that the Act authorised the orders as to the provision of financial statements made against the applicants as well as those for their examination. The real question is whether these orders must be complied with despite the pending criminal trial against Mr Cacu. Another way of putting this question is whether that part of the investigation of their affairs comprising compliance with the orders should be delayed until after the trial. Although it is not known quite how significant the sought disclosures would be as a practical matter, it can be readily accepted that they would assist the Commissioner to perform his functions under the Act and serve the objects of the Act as they apply to the Mr Cacu. Furthermore, it is self evident that the function and those objects might be frustrated to a greater or lesser degree by delay because of actions that might be undertaken by the applicants or of their agents to conceal or dissipate assets that have been restrained but not identified.
	
	
	The question here is whether the Act has so adjusted the incidents of trial according to law that the investigative processes ordered to occur must proceed without delay or impediment despite the pendency of Mr Cacu’s trial. Although the statement of affairs and the examination are processes set in motion by orders of the Court, the examination is not conducted by the Court or the Registrar as distinct from the situation in Lee 1. The powers of the Court to control the use of the statement and the conduct of the examination and the information Mr Cacu might disclose, obviously enough, cannot be delegated to the appointed examiner, nor in any sense can the examiner be regarded as acting judicially: he or she is the agent of the executive. It is not altogether clear whether, in light of s 266A, the Court could make it a condition of its orders to the effect that neither the statement nor the information provided by Mr Cacu at the examination be disclosed to the prosecution, though I rather think it could. Certainly such a condition could not be imposed by the examiner in respect of matter disclosed in any examination. However, no party submitted that this might overcome the prejudice that would otherwise subsist were the stay not granted. In this regard, I should mention the point made by French CJ in Lee 1 at [54] (supra) to the effect that keeping material disclosures secret from the prosecution would not remove the forensic disadvantage an accused person would suffer in the conduct of his or her trial from compulsory disclosure, in this respect not disagreeing with the characterisation of the disadvantage stated by Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 at [124] (supra, cf Kiefel J, with whom Bell J agreed, in Lee 1 at [164], [211]-[213] and [240], Crennan J at [ibid 141] where her Honour seemingly implied that secrecy might be sufficient, as did Gageler and Keane JJ at [340]).
	


Conclusion


	
	The Commissioner has not submitted that there is a particularly urgent need for the financial statements or examinations additional to the common sense consideration that, when dealing with assets of the kind in question here and the inducement to dissipate or conceal them created by impending forfeiture, it is advantageous and best fulfils the objects of the Act to proceed with promptitude. This must be balanced against the real and substantial risk that the legitimacy of the administration of criminal justice will be prejudiced by breach of the fundamental principles to which I have referred (and which, despite the differing results reflecting varying interpretations of relevant legislation, are not significantly controversial) that the Court not only has the power but also the duty to maintain as far as it is able. I am also minded that, in this Court, Button J has made orders staying examinations pending completion of a trial. Where, perhaps, no bright line distinctions can be made, judicial comity should in a comparable case (which this substantially is) lead me to the same result. Accordingly, in respect of Mr Cacu, I propose to order a stay of the orders requiring him to provide statements of his affairs and to order that examination not take place until his impending trial has been completed.
	
	
	Ms Kuzniatsova is in a different position. She has not been charged and is not facing pending criminal proceedings. It was submitted on her behalf that her defending the confiscation proceedings will be prejudicial to the interests of her husband in his criminal proceedings. Of course, she has a privilege in respect giving evidence in criminal proceedings under s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), but proceedings under the Act are civil in character. In Zhao, the forfeiture proceedings against the accused’s wife were also stayed, essentially to avoid the multiplicity of proceedings (supra at [48]). However, a separate statement of affairs would, at all events, be required and her examination would also proceed independently. Although Button J stayed the wife’s examination in Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, at least partly this was because of the possibility that she also might be charged with supplying the drugs forming the basis of her husband’s charges. There is no evidence and it is not submitted that Ms Kuzniatsova is facing this risk. I do not see a proper basis for interfering with the ordinary procedures applying to her by virtue of the orders made against her.
	


Extension of time


	
	The applicants sought orders extending the time in which to make applications under s 42 of the Act to revoke the restraining orders presently applying to their property. Such an application must be made within 28 days after being notified of the order, if an application has been made for an extension within that period, within such longer period not exceeding three months as the court allows: s 42(1A). There is no question that the application for an extension was made within time. The applicant was in custody during the whole of the 28 day period and, it is submitted, the practical difficulties of mounting a substantive application during that period are so manifest as to make it appropriate to extend the time. The extension was opposed by the Commissioner on the ground that, apart from referring to the incarceration of Mr Cacu, no evidence of the difficulties facing an application for revocation has been adduced. It seemed to me that the difficulties of dealing with legal proceedings whilst in gaol are obvious whilst, on the other hand, it was conceded on behalf of the Commissioner that there was no prejudice that might be occasioned by acceding to the application. For these reasons, I made the order extending time to the applicants to 1 July 2015.
	


Orders


	
	The parties, within seven business days of delivery of this judgment are to submit agreed orders effecting the conclusions I have expressed. Failing agreement, the applicants are to submit their proposed orders with brief submissions within five business days of the expiry of the time for submission of agreed orders, to be followed by the Commissioner within a further three business days.
	
	
	As to costs, the parties are to submit agreed orders or make submissions in accordance with the timetable in order 1.

2702825,R v Jeremiah [2015] NSWDC 316,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a young man who has committed a particularly serious crime and with it another serious crime. It is not surprising that the purposes of sentencing point in different directions in this case. One of the reasons is that this young man has a particularly deprived background. I should first specify the crimes that I am sentencing the young man for. I will just suspend my reasons there.
	


HIS HONOUR: Moromi Jeremiah, I am sentencing you in a moment, or not in a moment, shortly. You probably know that what I do is talk first about the case, about your case and that is going to take about 30 or 40 minutes of talking about your case and then I announce the sentence at the end. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes sir.

HIS HONOUR: That is because I have to give reasons. You have committed a serious crime, a couple of serious crimes, and I am taking the step of sending you to gaol and so I have to give reasons for that and that is what I am doing now. I do that first.


	
	The particularly serious crime is one of wounding someone with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That is an offence against s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards that as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to that crime. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of seven years to the crime. The second offence, which was committed on the same occasion, is the crime of aggravated entering a building with intent. That is an offence against s 111(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards that as a serious crime as well and has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that crime. When I am sentencing him for the second crime of aggravated entering with intent, the offender, whose name is Moromi Jeremiah, has asked me to take into account an offence of common assault which was committed on the same occasion. Common assault is an offence against s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. I will take that into account at the time of sentencing him for the entering the building with intent and I sign the document under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 certifying that I will take it into account.
	
	
	I should begin with saying what happened when Moromi Jeremiah committed these crimes. It is set out in exhibit A which was tendered by Mr Paish, the Crown Prosecutor who appeared in the sentence proceedings. It was the afternoon of 25 September 2013. Garry Green was returning home to his unit in Blacktown. As he walked towards the unit, he was confronted by Moromi Jeremiah. Moromi Jeremiah was holding a hammer in his hand. He demanded to be let into Mr Green’s unit where he lived with his brother, Michael Green. Moromi Jeremiah was living in another unit at the same complex at the time. They went to the door of the unit where Mr Jeremiah “opened the screen door which was closed but not completely shut. The front door was open.” That action amounted to the aggravated entering the building with intent.
	
	
	Moromi Jeremiah then “wrapped his left arm around Garry Green’s neck area in a headlock.”. He walked down the hallway still holding Garry Green in a headlock and then pushed him to the ground as they entered the lounge room. That is the assault which I am taking into account.
	
	
	Michael Green, who is the victim of the crime I am about to describe, was sitting on the lounge with a couple of other people. Moromi Jeremiah approached him. Michael Green went to stand up but before he could Moromi Jeremiah “commenced hitting the victim with the hammer. The offender raised the hammer above his head and swung it at the victim, striking the victim to the head and body a number of times. During the assault the offender said words to the effect, ‘You snitched on Eric, you fucking snitch.’” During the violence a coffee table was broken but Moromi Jeremiah “continued to assault the victim with the hammer, hitting him a number of times on the legs with it.” He stopped a short time later and then left. He was arrested shortly afterwards.
	
	
	The victim was taken to Westmead Hospital. Included in exhibit A is a report from the doctor who treated him. The report said that he had a “4cm linear wound over vertex at scalp”. Michael Green was also wounded over his flank which breached the skin into the abdominal cavity. He also had a wound to one of his upper arms. The doctors administered a CT scan to his abdomen “which showed bleeding from the kidney and possible damage to the ureter.” He “also had bleeding from the spleen.” In addition the victim “had blood in the urine and required an in-dwelling urinary catheter”. He was operated on the day after the assault and a stent was put into his ureter. He needed “daily blood tests to check for ongoing blood loss from the damage to the kidney and to the spleen.” The report said that he “sustained deep cuts to the head”. These “required stitches in the emergency department.” Fortunately a CT scan of the brain was normal and his “prognosis for recovery” was described as good. The doctor expected a full recovery once the stent was removed. There are photographs of the injuries to Michael Green depicting injuries in his hip area and bruises on his leg and arms. In fact there are injuries to his left arm and to his torso. It was a vicious and very serious attack.
	
	
	It is important for a judge in sentencing an offender to also refer to and take into account the personal circumstances, positive and negative, of the offender. One important factor is obviously an offender’s criminal record. In this case Moromi Jeremiah - who is still only 20 and was not even 18 and-a-half when he committed these offences - has a significant criminal record already. He has two offences for robbery in company, committed in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 he committed an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and in 2011 he was engaged in two affray offences. In 2010 he committed a break enter and steal and he has a number of offences for resisting police in the execution of their duty. Most of these offences were dealt with by the Children’s Court.
	
	
	In addition, in this case there is a detailed psychological report from a registered psychologist, Mr Chafic Awit, dated 20 August 2015. The report is unverified. By that I mean the history taken by the psychologist is not backed up by any sworn or affirmed evidence. Nevertheless it seems to me to be consistent with the criminal record of Moromi Jeremiah. The psychologist says this about the offender’s childhood -
	


“Mr Jeremiah has described an unstable childhood. Mr Jeremiah advised that as far back as he could remember he was the victim of both physical and verbal abuse inflicted upon him by his mother. Mr Jeremiah advised that he does not have a close relationship with his mother, and that whilst growing up she worked as a drug dealer to support her own addiction.”

She often blamed him for things going wrong. Moromi Jeremiah met his own father only once when he was 12 and went on to tell the psychologist “that his mother had a string of abusive boyfriends that would live with them from time to time. Mr Jeremiah further advised that he was physical[ly] abused by many of his mother’s boyfriends.” He went on to say that he was “often the victim of physical and verbal aggression at school.” When he told his mother she told him that he had to stand up for himself. When he did this at school and fought back he was suspended. This happened more than once and he “eventually enrolled in a Behavioural school in order to complete his Year 10 School Certificate.”


	
	Mr Jeremiah’s mother sent him to Samoa to be disciplined by family members. “Mr Jeremiah advised that his uncle who was drunk at the time, and had ripped Mr Jeremiah’s clothing off nearly sexually abused him. Mr Jeremiah advised that if it were not for his shouting, which brought other family members into the room, he would have been the victim of a sexual assault.”
	
	
	Mr Jeremiah started to drink alcohol when he was 12 and by 14 “he was abusing the illicit substance ice.”
	
	
	As I said, Mr Jeremiah was arrested on the day that he committed the offence, namely 25 September 2013, and has been in custody bail refused ever since then. In due course his sentence will date from then.
	
	
	The psychologist noted that in custody Mr Jeremiah “has abstained from alcohol and illicit substances. He advised for the first time in a long time his mind is clearer and level headed. He expressed his remorse on a number of occasions within the session. He further advised that he had been physically assaulted on three occasions in prison. One assault led to him breaking his arm, however he did not feel safe reporting this, so he advised the prison guards that he had slipped.”
	
	
	The psychologist has diagnosed a number of conditions. One is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as an associated oppositional defiant disorder and a major depressive disorder, as well as anxiety. Obviously there is also a substance abuse disorder. None of that is surprising given Moromi Jeremiah’s reported background. The psychologist offered the opinion that “Mr Jeremiah’s aggressive behaviours appear to be a direct consequence of his psychological conditions. Clinically, Mr Jeremiah presents as a man with significant psychological issues stemming from his unstable childhood.” The psychologist thought that the ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder “may have led to the offences before the court”. He also expressed the opinion that “Mr Jeremiah’s poor decision-making skills, impulsivity, and poor emotional regulation ability…has played a significant role in relation to the offences before the court.” The psychologist set out a treatment plan at the end of his report taking into account that Mr Jeremiah may be in prison or may not be in prison. The psychologist added his opinion that a “lengthy custodial/harsh sentence at this stage is likely to cause further deterioration of Mr Jeremiah’s condition, which in turn would likely make his condition resistant to treatment in the future.” He also expressed concern that if in custody, “Mr Jeremiah will not receive the sufficient treatment required for his rehabilitation.”
	
	
	There are a number of factors pointing in different directions which are relevant in sentencing in this case. Moromi Jeremiah is a relatively young man. He committed these offences when he was just over 18 he is now only 20. Aggravating features are that he committed these offences when he was on probation for other offences committed when he was under 18. That is specifically mentioned as an aggravating feature in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He had also been on a Community Service Order. In addition, he has a criminal record involving violence. He has robberies in company, affrays and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. I regard that as an aggravating factor. In addition the offence was committed in the home of the victim Michael Green. That is regarded by Parliament as an aggravating factor, understandably. Mr Green was at home relaxing with friends when he was violently attacked by an out of control man with a hammer. A further specified aggravating feature by Parliament is that a weapon was used. I put little weight on that specifically as an aggravating factor. Indeed I put no additional weight on it as an aggravating factor because it is difficult to envisage how a wounding can occur without a weapon. Nevertheless, looking at the offence generally I regard the nature of the weapon, namely a hammer, as significant as being relevant to the offence that was committed.
	
	
	The injuries were serious. There was some debate between Mr Paish and Mr R Munro of counsel, who appeared for Mr Jeremiah in the sentence proceedings, as to how serious those injuries should be regarded. I need to make some kind of assessment of their seriousness.
	
	
	The victim was hospitalised for a number of the injuries he sustained as a result of being bashed by the hammer. He sustained internal injuries and required surgery. I was directed to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in Adams v R [2011] NSWCCA 47. In that case the victim “was struck on the middle right finger, crushing the fingertip, smashing the bones and causing blood to come gushing from the wound”. The victim was also assaulted “with a baseball bat to the top of [his] head” causing “a laceration to the scalp”. Latham J, with whom Campbell and Price JJ agreed, described at [35] the injuries as follows -
	


“The nature of the injuries was at the lower end of the spectrum comprehended by grievous bodily harm. As against that, the attack on Mr Butler was sustained, it involved blows with weapons to vulnerable parts of the body and it was committed in company. On balance, the offence moderately below the mid-range of objective gravity.”.


	
	I would regard this offence as falling below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not far below that bearing in mind the number of blows, the fact that there were internal injuries and that surgery was required.
	
	
	There are other factors which are personal to Moromi Jeremiah. Although the assertions in the psychological report are unverified they are consistent with Moromi Jeremiah’s behaviour to date. I accept the psychological report and its diagnosis. They accord with common sense.
	
	
	It is relevant to regard Mr Jeremiah as being immature. His behaviour was completely unacceptable and was committed by him as an adult, but as a very young adult. So far as his rehabilitation is concerned, I am quite guarded about that. It is good to learn that he has abstained from drugs and alcohol whilst in prison. That is consistent with there being no disciplinary reports for drugs or alcohol, although it must be balanced against the disciplinary reports for him being involved in two assaults. There was also some fighting, but as Mr Munro pointed out, one does not know who started the fights. It does not take into account self‑defence. Nevertheless, there are two assaults.
	
	
	I take into account the psychologist’s opinion about the impact of custody although, of course, the Corrective Services do as best as they can with the resources which they have to treat offenders for conditions which require treatment. I take into account the psychologist’s opinion that the diagnosed mental health conditions - even though as Mr Paish observed they are more behavioural conditions - contributed to the offending behaviour. The fact that he had those conditions may mean that I can place a little less weight on general deterrence.
	
	
	As I said at the commencement of these remarks, in sentencing somebody in a case such as this the purposes of sentencing tend to point in different directions. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists those purposes. It is obviously important in a case such as this that Moromi Jeremiah be adequately punished for a very serious crime. Other people must also be deterred, although slightly less weight is placed on that. But pointing in the other direction is personal deterrence which is important for Mr Moromi Jeremiah. By that I mean in the past he has committed offences of violence. This was an unprovoked attack on a man in the privacy of his own home and one of the purposes of sentencing Mr Jeremiah will be to stop him committing other crimes like that against members of the community. Indeed, one of the purposes of sentencing is to protect the community from the offender. Another important purpose is that Moromi Jeremiah must be made accountable for his actions. It is completely unacceptable in the community that a person can behave like Moromi Jeremiah did in entering another man’s home and attacking him with a hammer regardless of the motive that he had for doing it. I must recognise the harm done to the victim, Michael Green, in the sentence which I impose. I must also take into account the need for rehabilitation for a young offender such as Moromi Jeremiah.
	
	
	On the other hand I need to take into account Moromi Jeremiah’s own personal background. In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 the Chief Justice and Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ at 594 ([40]) said the following -
	


“The circumstance that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.”

I regard that observation as relevant to this case. I also accept what their Honours said at [43] that the -

“[E]xperience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person’s make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.”

However at 595 ([44]), their Honours said the following -

“An offender’s childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender’s recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender’s moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.”


	
	That is what I mean in this case by the punishment I impose on Moromi Jeremiah needing to take into account considerations which point in different directions. There is a need to take into account his immaturity and his own personal background as contributing to the behaviour which he did. On the other hand it is important that he be punished for the crime which he committed and that the community be protected from him behaving in that kind of way.
	
	
	Mr Munro made available to me some statistics produced by the Judicial Commission which I marked for identification 2. I must bear in mind that they represent a very narrow sample, being 14 cases. And as Mr Paish correctly pointed out, of those 14 persons who have pleaded guilty aged between 18 to 20, we know nothing about their criminal records.
	
	
	Mr Jeremiah has, through his psychologist, expressed remorse. I put little weight on that. It was not verified in evidence but I do take into account that he has pleaded guilty which is some evidence of remorse. It is not as strong as it could be.
	
	
	Moromi Jeremiah pleaded guilty to the more serious offence of wounding with intent what is agreed was a very early opportunity. There is some dispute as to the formalities involved as to when the plea was entered but I propose to allow him the appropriate maximum discount of 25% on the sentence. That means in due course when I come to sentence him for that offence it will be reduced by 25% to account for the fact that he pleaded guilty thereby saving expense to the justice system and not requiring the victim to give evidence in a defended trial. The plea of guilty to the aggravated entering the building with intent was not forthcoming until a later time and I propose to accept Mr Paish’s submission that an appropriate discount for that sentence will be 10% which I will allow shortly when I sentence Mr Jeremiah.
	
	
	It is agreed that the intention of Moromi Jeremiah in entering the building was no more than to intimidate the victim. In other words, I do not find that he entered the building with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm. That intent developed when he attacked the victim inside. There are, I accept, special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio or standard ratio between a non-parole period and a parole period. In due course I will specify those and make the allowance.
	
	
	I have taken into account the sentences which were imposed in two cases which Mr Munro pointed to me. One was Adams that I have referred to and the other is R v Porter [2015] NSWCCA 59. Bearing in mind where the crime of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm lies, so far as objective seriousness is concerned, and bearing in mind the aggravating factors, I would regard an appropriate sentence for that crime as being one of seven years imprisonment. Bearing in mind the factors relevant to the other offence including the fact that I take into account the assault when sentencing him for the entering with intent, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of four years imprisonment. In each case I also bear in mind the maximum sentences which Parliament has fixed for those crimes.
	
	
	It is here that I allow the discounts for the plea of guilty entered by Moromi Jeremiah. That means that the seven year sentence for the wounding will be reduced by 25% so that the sentence would be five years and three months imprisonment. I would reduce the four years sentence to one of 43 months rounded off to three and a half years imprisonment. I would regard it as appropriate to accumulate the sentences somewhat because they are different crimes and I need to take into account for the entering the building that the assault which was inflicted on Garry Green, a different victim. I would be inclined to accumulate the two sentences by some nine months so that the total sentence I would have imposed for the two crimes would be six years imprisonment.
	
	
	Normally for a sentence of six years imprisonment, Parliament envisages that the non-parole period - the period that the offender must spend in gaol - would be 75% namely, four years and six months. However Mr Munro has argued that there are special circumstances for increasing the parole period in this case and Mr Paish acknowledges those special circumstances.
	
	
	The psychologist has set out a treatment plan. The special circumstances which I regard as important are these. Moromi Jeremiah is still a young man and there needs to be an opportunity for him to be integrated back within the community with the appropriate psychological and psychiatric support to deal with his substance abuse issues and the issues which come from his childhood. It is encouraging that he has already detoxified during the last two years that he has been in prison. I would regard it as appropriate to fix a non‑parole period in this case of three and-a-half years, which means that the time spent on parole will be two and-a-half years.
	
	
	I also regard it as appropriate to fix one sentence, namely an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In other words instead of fixing two sentences which I would accumulate to effectively be a sentence of six years imprisonment, I will aggregate the two sentences and fix one sentence of six years imprisonment with a non‑parole period of three and-a-half years.
	
	
	I fix a non‑parole period of three and-a-half years imprisonment. It commenced when you went into custody on 25 September 2013 and it will expire on 24 March 2017. The balance of the term is two and-a-half years commencing on 25 March 2017 and expiring on 24 September 2019. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole (which is fixed by the Parole Authority) is 24 March 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR: What are your instructions, Mr Harb, so far as the psychological report is concerned?

HARB: Would your Honour allow me--

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Yes.

HARB: I have instructions for the report to be made available.

HIS HONOUR: It can be made available? That’s a good idea. Yes. It’s going to be helpful to him. I will direct my associate to send to Corrective Services a copy of exhibit 1. Now Moromi Jeremiah you have received a six year prison sentence for both crimes. Six years. It commenced when you went into custody, which was a good idea for you not to apply for bail, not that you would have got it but you started your sentence nearly two years ago, 25 September 2013. The overall sentence will finish six years afterwards on 24 September 2019. That’s when your sentence finishes. However you are going to become eligible for parole after three and-a-half years and that date comes up on 24 March 2017. The Parole Authority assesses whether you get parole or not. I don’t order that. Obviously they’ll take into account your behaviour in prison and all the other things that they take into account. I’ve regarded your parole period as two and-a-half years as being appropriate, instead of the normal amount which would be one and-a-half years, for the reasons that I’ve given. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes sir.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

The plaintiff’s evidence


	
	The plaintiff, who was born in 1973, completed the High School Certificate at Blayney High School in 1991 and thereafter has held a series of labouring jobs in premises such as an abattoir, a tannery and a timber mill. He has always been a manual worker, accepting heavy labouring jobs and, although regularly employed, has worked almost entirely in this sphere of work.
	
	
	The plaintiff commenced employment with the defendant as a saw operator in April 2011, about six weeks before the date of the accident. His knowledge of the system of work and the functioning of the machinery relates only to what he learned during this limited period. However, the plaintiff’s supervisor, Mr Parker, who was also called to give evidence by the plaintiff, had a much longer acquaintance both with the circumstances in which the machine the plaintiff was operating was purchased and installed, as well as the work system, and I will set out this information from his evidence at this part of my judgment.
	
	
	Mr Parker told the court that the machine in question had arrived from Canada approximately four weeks before the plaintiff commenced his employment, and had given trouble from the first (in other words, prior to the plaintiff’s employment). He identified those problems as including the logs being restricted in their movement by posts on the machinery, the blades striking the guide post and problems when the machinery jammed, which meant that the machinery had to be stopped so that the logs could be brought back. It was necessary to ensure that the feeding system would not “explode” because if logs and blades broke away at speed from the machine, in a work area he said was only twice the size of the courtroom (where up to 15 people were working), everyone in the premises would be at risk. There were constant problems with the need to stop and repair the blades on an hourly basis. If the blade suffered wear as a result of one of these blockages, it would be necessary to place it; Mr Parker described the need for the blade to be inspected on such occasions as being “every hour”.
	
	
	Prior to the plaintiff’s commencement of employment, Mr Parker had already spoken to the business owner, Mr Slattery, “several times a day” about the problems. He had additionally spent several hours on the telephone to the manufacturers in Canada. He had pointed out to Mr Slattery that it would be 10 minutes work to solder a set of stairs to the machine to enable the saw operator to inspect the problem when the saw broke down during operation, which was occurring constantly.
	
	
	The plaintiff described how he commenced work with no training on the machine, and no assistance or advice from Mr Slattery with these problems. Like Mr Parker, he spoke to Mr Slattery about the problems, and suggested solutions. In particular, the plaintiff told Mr Slattery, as he repeated later to the expert retained in these proceedings on his behalf (Exhibit C, paragraph 33), that there should be a walkway or railing to get up on the platform deck but those requests had not been acted upon.
	
	
	Mr Hobby, in cross-examination, identified, from some black and white photocopies shown to him by counsel for the defendant, the machinery in question. This enabled a video of the machinery in question to be found on YouTube and played. The plaintiff watched this video from the witness box and carefully explained, as the machine could be seen cutting logs, the workings of the machine, noting (as did Mr Parker in his later evidence) that the machine in the YouTube video clip is located on the ground, whereas the machine on which the plaintiff was injured was elevated. This elevation added to the difficulties. Even with the machine on the ground, the person shown standing in the position occupied by the plaintiff in the photograph shown to him was just standing on the wooden plank which was “not secured”.
	
	
	The plaintiff used the electric saw to cut wood in accordance with measurement specifications given by the mill’s customers. However, this presented further difficulties, because the machine (which had been ordered from Canada) had its settings in imperial measurements, whereas the Australian customer requirements were always in metric measurements. This meant that the computer program settings had to be reset constantly.
	
	
	The plaintiff said he reported all these problems to the manager, Mr Slattery. They were a matter of common knowledge at the mill, where the machine was jokingly called “the death trap”. The plaintiff was essentially told to do the best he could, and left to operate the machine without any further instructions, or supervision of any specific nature, from Mr Slattery.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the plaintiff was having difficulties operating the saw from almost the very first. He was required to work at speed and if something went wrong, the log had to be wound back to the most convenient and closest stopping point, to avoid the blade going the length of the track (which could dull or damage the blade). This meant climbing over part of the machinery to get to the blade, and this was the immediate triggering factor to the plaintiff’s accident.
	


The accident


	
	On the day in question the plaintiff started cutting the first log which was very large, and set what he called the “back post”. When the log was in place, he set the depth limit for the saw and started cutting. The saw cut for a certain distance and then stopped at the metal post. The problem was that the saw was not working properly; had the saw been working properly, it would have missed the metal post which appeared to have caused it to jam.
	
	
	The plaintiff got up and walked onto the rollers towards the deck. He put his right foot on a portion of the framework above the big right roller and put another foot onto the timber. This timber slab gave way, rolled and took the plaintiff’s feet out. He fell in between two big rollers with his left arm hooked up to the top deck. This meant he fell through the gap and onto the floor which was about 1.8 to 2 metres away. He described a reference in the work safety report to his having fallen on the rollers as “wrong”.
	
	
	The plaintiff is not particularly articulate, and a more helpful description may be gained from the description of the accident in the expert report as follows:
	


“27. On the day of injury, whilst the Plaintiff was operating the saw the saw blade struck one of the back posts and jammed. When the saw blade struck a back post the saw had to be reversed in order to free the saw blade and also to inspect the saw to ensure it was not damaged. The Plaintiff explained that the operation of the saw could not recommence until such time as the saw blade had been inspected and verified as defect free.

28. In order to inspect the saw blade the Plaintiff retracted the saw blade and shut down the saw by use of the operator’s controls. To access the saw blade and to undertake the inspection the Plaintiff was required to climb up onto the rollers of the infeed deck. The Plaintiff explained that there were no walkways available for use and that access to the saw blade was by way of the infeed deck where the Plaintiff would make his way along the deck in order to reach the blade.

29. The Plaintiff explained that as he made his way to climb up onto the rollers of the infeed deck in order to undertake the inspection of the saw blade that he was required to place his left foot onto a slab of timber that was positioned on the rollers.

30. The Plaintiff explained that as he went to climb up onto the infeed deck that he placed his left foot on a timber slab which was adjacent to the sloped surface. As he placed his left foot onto the slab in order to stand up on the deck and bring his right foot forward to traverse the deck the slab moved and commenced to slide down the inclined surface. The action of the slab moving and sliding initiated the fall of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff explained that at the time that the slab of timber moved he was approximately 2 metres above ground below.

31. The Plaintiff explained that as he fell down the inclined surface he reached out with his arm in order to arrest his fall however, fell landing on the rollers with his left arm outstretched and as a consequence sustained injury to his left shoulder.

32. The Plaintiff explained that he fell as previously detailed and was helped up from that position by the supervisor who observed the Plaintiff’s fall.”


	
	Mr Parker’s evidence, which is set out below, was substantially consistent with the plaintiff’s description of his accident. There are minor differences in their evidence in relation to the machine structure (in that Mr Parker has referred to a log feeder being in the way as the principal reason why the plaintiff could not access the machinery in the manner described by the defendant), but this has no relevance to the mechanics of the accident.
	


The plaintiff’s cross-examination


	
	In cross-examination it was put to the plaintiff that he should have seen a laser beam which indicated where the saw would cut into the wood and that if he had seen this he would have realised where the saw was cutting, and stopped the machine. The plaintiff responded that he did not see the laser beam from his position because it was sometimes not possible to do so, as he was several metres away from where the saw was cutting. Additionally, he would have needed to see it before he dropped.
	
	
	This portion of the cross-examination was objected to pursuant to s 318(1) Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (NSW) (“the WIM Act”) on the basis that no such claim had been included either in the pre-filing defence (assuming this was possible), which was not agreed to, in the defence filed in these proceedings. As a result, the plaintiff’s expert had prepared a report which does not refer to the role of the laser.
	
	
	Mr Rickard submitted that it was still capable of being “evidence”, although conceding that it had not been referred to in the pre-filing document.
	
	
	The circumstances in which parties should be held to the pre-filing pleading are set out by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Wilkinson v Perisher Blue Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 250, and I rejected this line of questioning on that basis. I additionally note, however, that if I were to consider this evidence on its merits, there is no explanation as to how this laser light being seen could have prevented the accident. Whether the plaintiff saw in advance that the saw was about to jam, or it actually jammed, he still had to climb over the machinery. Additionally, as the plaintiff had already stated, it was sometimes not possible to see the laser beam because it was several metres away from where he was standing. The laser light evidence is thus of no assistance to the defendant.
	
	
	Mr Rickard challenged the plaintiff as to why he had not brought the saw back to a better position for access, in that he could have taken it all the way back in the opposite direction, where the saw was more accessible to anyone operating the machine. The plaintiff said (and as is noted below Mr Parker agreed) that the position to which he moved the saw was both closer and more practical, and I prefer their evidence on this issue.
	
	
	Wherever the saw was moved to, the plaintiff still had to climb onto the machine. The plaintiff said:
	


“To observe the front of the blade I had to climb onto the bed rollers. That’s where I fell.”


	
	It was also submitted that the plaintiff could have obtained an aluminium ladder and put it against the machine, which would give him closer access and help him to get the job done more quickly. The plaintiff said he would not have been quicker than climbing over the rollers and that he would still have had to get onto the machine. He acknowledged that a ladder was there.
	
	
	Mr Parker’s evidence about the ladder and the machine for log feeding, set out below, is the basis upon which I have rejected this as an appropriate means of access to the machine.
	
	
	I will next set out the evidence of Mr Parker. The plaintiff’s cross-examination concerning his injuries and disabilities is discussed in more detail below.
	


Mr Parker’s evidence


	
	Mr Parker was the plaintiff’s supervisor. He ceased employment at the sawmill three weeks after the plaintiff’s accident, and told the court he was currently working as a bus driver.
	
	
	Mr Parker described the circumstances in which a brand new machine “out of the box” had been sent from Canada and installed in the mill, and that he had been involved in its setting up. From the first, there had been repeated difficulties in getting the machine to operate successfully (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) and those problems had never been fixed. By the time the plaintiff commenced work, the operator would have to bring the jammed machine saw back on its tread on a regular basis (he used the expression “every hour”).
	
	
	Mr Parker saw the same YouTube clip from the witness box and, like the plaintiff, noted that the machine shown on YouTube was on the ground, whereas this one was elevated and this added to the access difficulties.
	
	
	One difference between Mr Parker’s evidence and that of the plaintiff was that he described an additional “machine” on either side of the machine on which the plaintiff suffered the accident. The purpose of this additional machine was to enable logs to be fed onto and off the cutting platform. He said there was “no other way” to get to the machine when it stopped other than walking over the rollers.
	


The plaintiff’s accident


	
	Mr Parker, who was working a short distance away on the day of the accident, heard the sound of the blade hitting the post and realised that the blade and post could have been damaged. As he came towards the machine he saw the plaintiff had “started doing the usual climbing over” when “all of a sudden he slipped”. He said that the plaintiff “went down, grabbed something” and fell. He was not cross-examined on this description.
	
	
	The plaintiff was taken to hospital that day. Mr Parker left the mill three weeks later. He continued, up until the time of his departure, to raise the issue of safety of the machine “several more times”.
	


Mr Parker’s cross-examination


	
	It was put to Mr Parker that the plaintiff would have been able to get to the machine more safely if he had brought the saw to the other end of the machine. Mr Parker disputed this, saying that the physical closeness of the machinery, and in particular to the log feeding machine, meant that there was “physically not enough room”. He said if the blade is struck, you “have to get on top” of the machine. The blade has to be “tensioned”. When asked why the blade would have stopped on the day in question, he said there “could be a thousand reasons”.
	
	
	Mr Parker also disagreed with the suggestion that the only reason to get on top of the machine would have been if the blade could not be taken out of the timber. He said that there had been situations where the blade had stopped for no known reason, and it was necessary to get up to inspect what had occurred. Nor did he agreed that the problem could have been avoided by the plaintiff going down the right hand side of the machine, or that it was possible in some way to climb underneath the machine. He said what the photographs of the machine in question did not show was that there was a machine conveyor belt two feet underneath the machine, and that this stopped the workers from accessing the machine closely.
	
	
	Mr Parker responded in a scornful tone to the suggestion that a ladder could have been placed against the machine. He said there was “nowhere to put a ladder” and that the instability of the ladder, the height of the machine and the lack of any position on the machine for the ladder to be placed safely, meant that the safest way to deal with the problem in the absence of a ladder wielded to the machine was to do what the plaintiff did.
	
	
	In re-examination, Mr Parker confirmed that it would have been “a 10-minute job” to wield a ladder on, and that this was what later occurred.
	
	
	Mr Parker, like the plaintiff, was an impressive witness, who had a clear and detailed recollection of the workplace layout, the work system, the day of the accident and the difficulties with the machine.
	


The expert’s report


	
	The plaintiff relied upon a report from Mr David Cockbain (Exhibit C), whose carefully written report is a model of how an expert report should be prepared; in fact, its conclusions were not referred to by counsel for the defendant, either in cross-examination of the plaintiff and Mr Parker, or in his submissions.
	
	
	Mr Cockbain was not able to visit the premises; the plaintiff’s former employer had gone into liquidation long before he wrote his report. This means that his factual opinions rest largely upon the plaintiff’s account and the letter of instructions from the plaintiff’s solicitors. As I have found the plaintiff to be a witness of truth, those findings of fact therefore rest on firm ground, but with one exception. Mr Parker’s evidence about the machine to feed the logs, the uselessness of the one available ladder and about the system and machine generally are, in my view, more accurate than the plaintiff’s own evidence, and where there is any discrepancy I have preferred the evidence of Mr Parker. However, as Mr Parker’s evidence assists the plaintiff, the impact of his additional evidence upon the factual scenario described by Mr Cockbain is to strengthen the validity of the report’s conclusions, rather than to undermine it.
	
	
	Mr Cockbain’s report sets out 17 factors contributing to the plaintiff’s injury:
	



	
	The failure of the defendant to provide and maintain a proper and safe place of work, and safe plant and equipment.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to provide and maintain safe and appropriate access to all places where the plaintiff was required to perform work.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to undertake a risk assessment of the task required to be undertaken by the plaintiff in the operation and inspection and maintenance of the plant.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to develop and implement a safe operating procedure/work instructions for the task of inspecting saw blades.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to warn the plaintiff of the risk of injury involved in performing the task of inspecting the saw blade whilst positioned on the in-feed deck at a height above ground level.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to develop, implement and deliver a competency based training and assessment package for the operation, inspection and maintenance of the plant prior to the plant use.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to provide adequate technical supervision to the plaintiff in the performance of his work.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to comply with the requirements of the NSW WorkCover Authority’s Code of Practice for Sawmilling Industry.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to install walkways and/or platforms fitted with guardrails to the timber in-feed system that complied with the requirements of Australian Standard AS 1657-1992 Fixed platforms, walkways, stairways and ladders – Design, construction and installation to provide access to areas where the plaintiff was required to undertake inspection and maintenance tasks.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to provide fall prevention devices and single point anchorages with an ultimate strength of 15kN in accordance with Australia Standard AS 1891.4:2009 Industrial fall-arrest systems and devices – Selection, use and maintenance.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to comply with the requirements of the National Code of Practice for Plant (NOHSC:1010(1994)), in particular clause 31 relating to the assessment of risks associated with plant in use.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to comply with the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (“the Act”) and the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 (NSW) (“the Regulation”), specifically s 8 of the Act and rr 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Regulation requiring the defendant to identify hazards, assess risk, eliminate or control risks, review risk assessments and control measures and provide instructions, training, information and supervision.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to control the risk associated with the requirement for the plaintiff to perform work at heights in accordance with r 56 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 (NSW).
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to ensure that an appropriate Human Machine Interface (HMI) system, software and programming system was developed and implemented that enabled the programming of operations in metric measurements.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to comply with the requirements of AS 1470-1986 Health and safety at work – Principles and practices, specifically relating to hazards and working at heights.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to develop and implement an effective occupational health and safety management system in accordance with the requirements of Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 4801:2001 Occupational health and safety management systems – Specification with guidance for use.
	
	
	The failure of the defendant to comply with the basic intent and articulated risk management controls as contained within the Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management – Principles and guidelines.
	



	
	The expert noted reasonable preventative measures that would not have involved expense in development or implementation. I note that a number of alternatives are suggested, of which the most attractive is the simple solution of the “ten minute welding job” proposed by Mr Parker, to weld a ladder to the machine so that it was high enough and stable enough to access the conveyer belt.
	
	
	Mr Cockbain notes (at paragraph 68) that he had not been provided with any material about supervision of the plaintiff. I am satisfied, from the evidence of Mr Parker, that the system of supervision in place failed because Mr Parker, the supervisor, both noted and reported hazards, failure to comply with safety systems (or rather failure to have a safety system), failure of the machine to comply with safety standards and the generally unsafe working conditions.
	
	
	In the section of his report on foreseeability (paragraphs 91 – 105) and preventability (paragraphs 106 – 110), Mr Cockbain paints a stark picture of an accident waiting to happen. He describes the risk (page 34, paragraph 114) as “significant” and the cost of correction of the problem as “minor”. I accept these findings as both reasonable and well-founded.
	


Findings on liability


	
	Mr Rickard’s submissions on liability were brief. He did not address any of the issues raised in the expert report, or the evidence of Mr Parker.
	
	
	Mr Rickard submitted that the procedure in place to deal with these repeated problems, namely the blade striking an object or becoming stuck in the wood, was to retract the blade and have the blade moved along the feed line to the opposite end, where it could be examined more closely.
	
	
	Both Mr Parker’s evidence, and the system set up in the YouTube video, show it was necessary for there to be another machine feeding the logs onto the conveyor belt. Mr Parker says, and I accept, that it would have been impossible for the plaintiff to obtain access to the machine in the way proposed by counsel for the defendant. Additionally, the plaintiff’s explanation that it was safer to bring the saw back a shorter distance rather than to have to run all the way to the opposite end, in order to avoid further damage or problems, is a reasonable one.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that seldom would a clearer case on liability be put to the court. There was extensive evidence of complaint by the plaintiff and his supervisor, an obviously dangerous system of work, and a serious injury which could have been prevented by the “simple remedy available” of proper access to the machine by a properly affixed ladder or any one of the other inexpensive alternatives proposed by the expert evidence. He asked me to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298) from the failure of the defendant to call Mr Slattery, a finding which I propose to make.
	
	
	Addressing the particulars of negligence as particularised in the statement of claim, I am satisfied that:
	



	
	The defendant knowingly failed to take any precautions for the safety of the machine operator, or to adequately consider the risks for any operator performing the plaintiff’s task (particulars (a) to (d)).
	
	
	The defendant failed to heed complaints from first Mr Parker and then the plaintiff, and responded to complaints by either telling the plaintiff to get on with it or saying that it would be fixed, but failing to take any action (particulars (f) and (g)). Particular (h), which provides that the plaintiff was not provided with a ladder or similar device is not made out, but I am satisfied that the ladder provided would have been, for the reasons explained by Mr Parker, inadequate.
	
	
	The defendant knowingly permitted an unsafe system of work, in that the plaintiff was required to climb and walk over unstable rollers (particulars (e), (i), (j)) in circumstances where there is nowhere for the plaintiff to hold onto a railing, or to be able to balance himself properly.
	
	
	The defendant’s servants or agents failed to train the plaintiff or give any instructions about how to operate the machine in a safer manner to avoid accidents of the kind which occurred.
	
	
	The defendant’s servants or agents knowingly failed to keep the machine in proper order to ensure that the saw did not strike objects in its path despite observing it regularly doing so both before and during the plaintiff’s time of employment (particulars (l) and (m)).
	



	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established liability. This brings me to the question of contributory negligence.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	The defendant relies upon the following particulars of contributory negligence (paragraph 6 of the Defence):
	



	
	Failing to keep a proper lookout;
	
	
	Failing to take proper precautions in all of the circumstances for his own safety;
	
	
	Being inattentive;
	
	
	Climbing onto the rollers to check the saw blade when there was no need to do so and in contravention of instructions issued by the employer;
	
	
	Failing to raise the saw to its full height and run it forwards over the top of the log to the end of the track and then obtain the step ladder which was available and whilst standing on the step ladder remove the covers in order to expose the blade for checking;
	
	
	Failing to perform the particular task in accordance with the system of work set in place by the employer.
	



	
	Mr Rickard submitted that the plaintiff had several options available and “made the wrong call” in circumstances where six weeks’ employment was long enough for him to realise that he needed to have a safe system in order to reactivate the machine when the saw stopped or became jammed. There was another pathway, in that he could walk down the right hand side and get onto the machine more safely.
	
	
	Mr Rickard acknowledged, however, the evidence of Mr Parker that there was a log feeder in the way. In those circumstances, it is hard to see how it could be submitted that the plaintiff should have adopted this course, and I do not consider that this amounts to evidence of contributory negligence.
	
	
	An employee who makes “the wrong call” may not necessarily be guilty of contributory negligence: Bankstown Foundry Pty Ltd v Braistina (1986) 160 CLR 301. The difficulty is that there really was no safe way for this machine to be operated unless one or more of the proposals put forward by the expert, and in particular the soldering on of a properly secure ladder, occurred.
	
	
	Dealing with each of the particulars set out in the Defence, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was failing to keep a proper lookout or being inattentive; no such suggestion was put to him in cross-examination.
	
	
	Particulars (4) and (6) (paragraphs 6.4 and 6.6 of the Defence) are of concern, in that there is no evidence of the plaintiff’s action being in contravention of instructions or of a system of work being put in place to the contrary. Not only was the plaintiff not cross-examined on this point, but neither was Mr Parker, and no evidence was called by the defendant. Those particulars are not made out.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant has failed to make out a claim for contributory negligence.
	


Section 151D(2) Workers Compensation Act 1987(NSW)


	
	At paragraph 9 of the Defence, the claim is made that these proceedings are not maintainable for the reason that the proceedings are commenced in contravention of s 151D(2) Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW). No submissions were made on this issue by either counsel for the plaintiff or counsel for the defendant.
	
	
	This brings me to the issue of quantum.
	


Quantum


	
	As is set out in the statement of issues, the sole matters for determination are the assessment of the plaintiff’s work injury damages as a result of his injury. This requires me to assess his past and future economic loss and superannuation. A Fox v Wood payback is agreed to be $16,070.00.
	
	
	I shall first set out the plaintiff’s treatment history, as many of the medical reports tendered are reports from the plaintiff’s treating doctors.
	


An outline of the plaintiff’s injuries


	
	All of the medical evidence described the plaintiff as having a “significant” injury (to use the term set out in the report of Dr Cass of 6 June 2012, Exhibit 1), requiring a series of operations, the last of which was “quite a large” operation (Dr Cass, report of 12 August 2012, Exhibit B), and the results of which have been relatively disappointing (Dr Cass, 17 December 2012).
	
	
	The plaintiff also developed psychological sequelae due to his enforced inactivity and pain. Part of the problem is that he was already, as Dr Cass so colourfully describes him, “a big lad” (report 17 August 2012) and this weight gain (from 111 kg to 138 kg, according to Dr Lawson) was “probably almost as big” as his shoulder problems both in his treatment and subsequent recovery.
	
	
	The shoulder injury was further exacerbated by carpal tunnel syndrome, which required surgery in August 2012. Unfortunately that surgery was also not very successful, and his condition in relation to his hand has now plateaued (Dr Lawson, 30 April 2013, Exhibit B).
	
	
	More recently, as a result of overuse to compensate for being essentially what he calls a “one-armed” man, he has begun to develop pain in the dominant right arm.
	
	
	All of the medical practitioners accept the plaintiff as a person whose account of his injuries and disabilities is unembellished, frank, honest and reliable.
	


The plaintiff’s treatment


	
	Mr Parker took the plaintiff to Blayney Hospital, where he was told they could not treat him. He was then driven to Bathurst Hospital by his former girlfriend where he underwent X-rays and a CT scan of his shoulder. He was supported in a sling and given a readmission date for two weeks later. He underwent an operation on his left shoulder on 10 June 2011 by Dr Nandapalan at Bathurst Hospital. This was open reduction and internal fixation of the fractured left humerus. He remained in hospital for only one day, after which he was allowed home with his arm in the sling and given analgesics. He also commenced physiotherapy.
	
	
	He began suffering further pain in his arm and on 16 August 2011 he consulted Dr Hammond for nerve conduction studies. His carpal tunnel problems were then recognised.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s shoulder remained very stiff. He underwent surgery by Dr Milne, being a left shoulder arthroscopic capsular release with subacromial decompression. This was followed by more physiotherapy, but there was still problems moving his arm.
	
	
	The plaintiff began to develop psychological responses to his incapacities and his inability to work. On 30 March 2012 he consulted a psychologist, Ms Anderson, and he was referred to Dr Cass by Dr Milne for ongoing supervision of his shoulder problems.
	
	
	The plaintiff continued to have problems moving his arm, even after all this time, and a report of 10 May 2012 from Dr Milne notes there has been a severe recurrence of post traumatic frozen shoulder. Dr Cass confirms this in a report of 6 June 2012. Dr Cass’ report shows that the nerve conduction studies did not show any focal neurological damage. However, the plaintiff continued to be troubled by pins and needles and numbness through and arm and hand as well as pain.
	
	
	The plaintiff underwent further surgery on 17 August 2012 when Dr Cass removed the plate and screws from the humeral fractures, carried out bone grafting into the screw holes, remove the extensive scar tissue and generally tidied up the area the subject of surgery.
	
	
	The plaintiff continued to have problems with his hand and arm in terms of pins and needles. As is noted above, he underwent carpal tunnel surgery at this time.
	
	
	The plaintiff remained unable to work until 11 October 2013, when his symptoms had sufficiently settled for him to commence employment as a security guard with Frontline Protection Group Pty Ltd where he worked two shifts, but ceased employment as he was unable to perform the work. At this stage, his medical condition has been described by both his treating doctors and medico-legal experts for the plaintiff and defendant as consisting of significant ongoing problems not only because of his inability to use his left arm but, by reason of relying more on his right arm, irritability developing at his right shoulder with some mild restriction of movement.
	


The medical evidence


	
	The defendant’s medical evidence consists of re-served reports, or additional reports, from the plaintiff’s treating doctors, Dr Cass and Dr Lawson. The report most relied upon by the defendant, namely Dr Cass’s report of 20 February 2013 concerning the plaintiff’s employability, is discussed in more detail in the section of this judgment concerning future economic loss.
	
	
	The reports of most assistance are those of Dr Cass, who wrote to Dr Milne in terms specifically aimed at explaining the plaintiff’s condition to workers compensation as follows:
	


“I have not made any promises – I think we might improve him by 10 or 20° in all range which would give him significant benefit. On certain occasions we actually give very significant benefit. Workers compensation authorities need to know that I agree with you Ben, I don’t think heavy manual labouring or heavy work is ever going to be sensible for Clinton in the future. He should be retrained in some kind of sedentary pursuit.” (Exhibit 1, page 41)


	
	Dr Cass wrote a follow up report on 17 August 2012 following the operation he had just performed:
	


“In short Clinton had quite a large operation and he will take a while to settle. At the start of the case his forward elevation at best was to 90° while he was asleep with significant force external rotation to 10° past neutral and internal rotation just to his trochanter. By the end of the case with a significant period of manipulation and gradually breaking of adhesions after the above release I was able to get forward elevation up to 130°, external rotation to nearly 70° and internal rotation to the mid lumbar spine, an improvement of at least 30 to 40cms. It is by no means normal but it is a significant improvement and I hope as his power and deltoid comes back that he will actually get some significant benefits as predicted in the preoperative assessment. I would be happy if he just got 10 or 20° in all planes to significantly increase the envelope of motion. I am not certain the operation will remove any of his pain, but hopefully the carpal tunnel release will. We will just have to wait and see.” (Exhibit 1, page 43)


	
	Dr Cass was hopeful of giving him “an ounce of pain relief and also 10 or 20° in all ranges; time will tell” (Exhibit 1, page 43). He further revised his position in his report of 17 December 2012 to the plaintiff’s general practitioner:
	


“In terms of CGU, I have been asked about a return to work. Firstly I feel that Clinton can drive an automatic car, obviously there is no climbing up and down into a chassis of a larger vehicle. He can work, but only using his right arm and hand for support and stability. He can hold little objects and do clerical work with his left hand, but the maximum weight with both of his hands together would be 4kgs. If he is going to return to work I have it should be on a reduced days, perhaps only starting three days a week or even two days and very low hours 3 to 4 hours per day and only if his right shoulder is pain free and he can cope with the job. I think he would be fine to start this again in another two months’ time.

In terms of permanent disability, Clinton is definitely going to be left with one. He has a relatively deficiency of his rotator cuff of the left shoulder. He has some altered bony anatomy there and scar tissue following his significant injury and he has had some neurological stretching and brachial plexus injury as well. He could be assessed as his maximum medical improvement will be at one year following the release surgery.

I wish him the best of luck and reiterate that his benefits now will not come from significant force or pushing or pulling the shoulder, but will probably come from swimming and the gradual stretch of putting his hands behind his head at night time. I would like to review him again in another four months which will get him to just past the six months mark post release of his shoulder.” (Exhibit 1, page 46)


	
	Dr Cass took a less optimistic view in his report of 30 April 2013:
	


“Clinton Hobby was reviewed in rooms today. It is just under a year since we released his left shoulder and tried to give him back a better range of motion. I have to say his benefits have been minimal from my procedure. I think I have helped him a little in terms of rotation and it feels a litter freer for him. Essentially, Clinton has been left with his left shoulder dramatically affected by his injury. Forward elevation is at most to 45 degrees, although with assistance I can get it up to well past 90 degrees and when he is lying flat he can get it even further. It points to the fact that the joint has been released and it is congruent and sits quite nicely following his first fixation and I cannot suggest that any further releasing will dramatically improve him. External rotation is to neutral and internal rotation is to the lowermost edge of the lumbar spine.

His predominant examination findings are generalised and difficult to define weakness affecting particularly the mid and anterior deltoid with nerve radiation symptoms that run all the way down to the hand, colour change, swelling in his hand and difficulties activating upper trapezius, scapular retractors, rhomboids and it is all quite highly indicative of the damage from the traction injury to his brachial plexus and the nerves of the upper limb as previously described by Richard Lawson. He is going to get gradual improvement but I think that he is at the maximum point now in terms of recovery and can be assessed as such.

I do not think there is a further role for operative release or intervention at the moment, although the insurance company needs to understand it is possible in the future for Clinton to re-injure the area, to get arthritis or have progressive rotator cuff problems and they may need to be investigated or treated down the track. They will, in no small part, be related to his current injury, although that would also depend on how he re-injured his arm or if anything further happens in the future.

I do think it is wise for him to be retrained and employed. It is probably his best way forward to maximise his improvement and function. I do think the vast majority of work as a security officer is reasonable for him to do but it is heavy impact, restraining people or violent altercations that he is not going to be able to fulfil those duties. I will see Clinton again if necessary based on his pain and symptoms.” (Exhibit 1, pages 48-49)


	
	Dr Lawson, who carried out the carpal tunnel surgery, was particularly concerned about the plaintiff’s weight, stating (Exhibit 1, pages 50-51):
	


“A second problem, which is probably almost as big as his shoulder, is his weight. He is 185cm tall and has increased in weight from 111kg to 129kg since the accident, giving him a BMI of 38. He is finding it very difficult to keep the weight off despite spending an hour a day at the gym.

From my point of view, Clinton clinically has carpal tunnel syndrome. I note that he has had nerve conduction studies performed in August 2011 which did not show any particular slowing of conduction across the median nerve but with his increase in weight and the prolonged dependency of the arm along with probable brachial plexus stretch injury, he has gone on to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. He needs to have nerve conduction studies to evaluate this and if he has surgery on the shoulder, he should have his carpal tunnel released concurrently.

Secondly, I am very concerned about his health in the long term with his obesity. I think at the least he needs to see a dietician and I wonder about the possible role of bariatric surgery for him.” (Exhibit 1, pages 50-51)


	
	The plaintiff also relies upon medico-legal reports from Dr Millions (dated 13 November 2013 and 28 May 2015 – Exhibit B). These provided similar opinions, as did a medic-legal report from Dr Clarke (21 January 2014).
	
	
	Dr Millons described the plaintiff’s current medical condition (i.e. as at 28 May 2015) as follows:
	


“CURRENT SITUATION

Mr Hobby states that his left shoulder is getting worse with the passage of time. He has a lot of pain over the front of the left shoulder, in the left axilla and down the back of the arm towards the elbow. Pain will radiate down to the wrist. The wrist clicks. He has very limited movements at the shoulder and elbow. He cannot get a fork up to his mouth with his left hand and tends to use his right hand to eat.

He recalled he had his carpal tunnel decompressed by Dr Lawson in August 2012. That did not make any difference to his hand symptoms. He still has pins and needles and numbness through all the hand and the hand changes colour. He finds it difficult to do hand exercises.

His symptoms are so bad he has not been able to sleep in a bed for the last four years. He sleeps on a corner lounge, propped up, to get some relief.

Over the last few months, Mr Hobby has been developing some problems in the right side of the neck and over the right shoulder. He feels this is because he is using that arm more to protect his left shoulder. He is starting to develop some discomfort in his right wrist and is getting pins and needles in his right hand. Sometimes Mr Hobby wakes in the morning with the feeling that his arms do not move. He describes the arms as “feeling empty”. He could not quite explain what he meant by that.

He is troubled by some discomfort in the right lower lumbar region. Pain does not radiate into either lower limb.

Mr Hobby is independent in his personal activities of daily living. He is able to shower himself and dress himself though dressing can be difficult. He finds it hard to do up laces and wears slip on shoes.

He does not do very much at home. His daughter helps out with a lot of the cleaning up. She also tends to the garden. He drives short distances. He finds that aggravating.

He still tries to play bowls. He has given up golf and fishing.” (Exhibit 1, page 15)

Analysis of the medical evidence


	
	I shall first set out the submissions of the parties.
	
	
	Mr Rickard did not dispute the seriousness of the injury or the extended time over which the plaintiff required surgery would substantially impact on past economic loss, and largely confined his submissions to what he called “the big fight”, namely the degree to which the plaintiff’s injuries impact upon his future employability.
	
	
	Mr Rickard submitted that the plaintiff had injured his non-dominant arm, adding that there was limited evidence as to the possible deterioration of the plaintiff’s right shoulder due to the favouring the injured left shoulder, and there was no evidence in relation to the anxiety and depression and other psychological issues set out in paragraphs (h) to (j) of the particulars (see paragraph 6 above). Scarring is minor and would be of little concern (I note that the plaintiff is a large man, with tattoos). Accordingly the only ongoing disabilities demonstrated by the medical evidence, according to the defendant, were the pain and restricted movement in the plaintiff’s left shoulder, with some diminishing power of strength and grip in his left arm and hand. All the surgery referred to in the particulars of disabilities had been performed and the likelihood of a future shoulder replacement was at best speculative.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this substantial and serious injury to the plaintiff’s left shoulder showed gross restriction of movement. The major injury he suffered to his shoulder resulted in constant pain as well as stiffness requiring a series of operations. Although the plaintiff presented in the witness box as someone who tended to minimise his injuries and disabilities, he continued to suffer from pain despite making significant efforts to improve his condition, including going to the gym (report of Dr Lawson, 24 July 2012, Exhibit B), doing his best to keep fit and to lose the weight he had gained, and playing an active part in his rehabilitation program including everything from a home exercise program to keeping as active as possible. A previously fit man and a keen golfer, he had no prior history of injury in the area, and his enforced immobility had resulted in a significant amount of weight loss. His problems were exacerbated by his relatively unsuccessful carpal tunnel surgery. His scarring was significant in that it was estimated at 4%.
	
	
	Amongst the defendant’s medical evidence is a report of Dr O’Keefe of 16 July 2014. Dr O’Keefe notes that the plaintiff’s measured range of movement as at this date was “much worse” than that measured by Dr Milne on 13 November 2013 and that he suffers from a “tardy ulnar nerve lesion and fixed flexion deformity of the elbow” which Dr O’Keefe states “has not been mentioned by any of the other examining doctors” (report of Dr O’Keefe, p 4). This has not been particularised, and was not referred to in submissions, so I do not propose to deal with this material further. I note Dr O’Keefe ‘s additional comments on Ms Monaghan’s report, which is discussed further below.
	
	
	What is not in dispute is that the evidence points to the plaintiff suffering very significant restrictions in his day to day activities because of his physical limitations, many of which are set out in the vocational assessment reports served by the defendant, and are not contained in the plaintiff’s particulars. These include cramping in his left shoulder whilst seated, being unable to sleep other than on the lounge as his sleep is disturbed by his left shoulder injury, use of pain medication to sleep, dizziness and fainting fits, depression requiring antidepressant medication and counselling with a psychologist, Ms Anderson, and, as he stated in his evidence, being able to drive only one handed. The question is one of degree, and of the impact of these symptoms on the plaintiff’s past and future economic loss.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the plaintiff’s own description of his current state of health.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence as to ongoing disabilities


	
	The plaintiff minimised his injuries in response to questions, and this minimising, coupled with his generally inarticulate responses and stoic attitude, means that I have had to look carefully for evidence of the full impact of his injuries and disabilities upon his daily life.
	
	
	I have had the advantage of seeing him in the witness box, and this is a case where the plaintiff’s demeanour is of vital importance in assessing the impact of his injuries.
	
	
	What evidence I have found is compelling. Although generally reluctant to describe pain, he described the pain he suffered in the course of surgery following the accident as “the worse pain I’ve ever been in in my life”. Although minimising the impact of his disabilities, he mentioned, briefly, considerable restrictions of a significant nature, including an inability to sleep in a bed (he has to sleep on the lounge), or drive using both hands (which must render employment as a fork lift driver, one of the positions proposed by the rehabilitation provider, somewhat problematic).
	
	
	The plaintiff gave some answers which appeared intended, not to mislead, but to avoid answering issues he was ashamed of. For example, he was not seeing any medical practitioners because there was “nothing more they can do”. I note, however, that he has been prescribed tranquillisers because of his sleeping difficulties and regularly saw a psychologist.
	
	
	Mr Rickard put to the plaintiff that he had gone snow skiing. He denied that he had been snow skiing or indeed played any sports. There is a reference in one of the medical reports to lawn bowling, but all of the medical practitioners note that a long career of playing sport had ended with the accident.
	
	
	While the plaintiff’s response to his injuries is one of stoicism, there is no doubt that the impact of the injuries and disabilities on his life has been particularly severe. This brings me to a consideration of his past and future economic loss.
	


Past economic loss including superannuation


	
	The plaintiff claims $169,793 for past economic loss as follows:
	


Period 1

Period 30/05/2011 – 10/10/2013

Period = 124 weeks

Plaintiff’s earnings = $nil

Comparable earnings = $900 net per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $900 x 124 = $111,600

Period 2

Period 11/10/2013 – 30/06/2014

Period = 37 weeks

Plaintiff total average net earnings for period $310 per week

Comparable earnings = $900 per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $590 x 37 = $21,830

Period 3

Period 01/07/2014 – 24/06/2015

Period = 51 weeks

Plaintiff’s total average net earnings for period $187 per week

Comparable earnings = $900 per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $713 x 51 = $36,363

Total = $169,793


	
	The defendant submits the plaintiff’s loss of wages should be calculated as follows:
	


Wage loss to date

$750 x 212 weeks = $159,000

Less earnings post November 2013 ($25,000)

Total = $134,000


	
	The parties are largely in agreement that the plaintiff suffered significant injuries preventing him returning to employment over a significant period; the difference is what to make of the plaintiff’s limited and slow return to the workforce and the basis for past earning loss.
	
	
	The plaintiff worked part time in security work which his treating doctors and the medico-legal expert reports agreed was unsuitable for him to perform because his injuries meant that at best he could perform a role as a static guard, not intervene in a situation of any potential danger. Mr Lidden SC submits, and I accept, this means that he has received wages for performing a job which he is really not medically able to perform without danger to himself. Accordingly, I propose to treat the plaintiff’s limited return to the workforce during this period with caution, as it is clear from the reports served by the defendant (including the report of Dr Cass dated 20 February 2013) that the only security officer work he should do as a “possibility” would be to provide armed escort for payroll deliveries, or armed protection for specific organisations such as banks. The word “possibility” is faint in the extreme.
	
	
	Similarly, I accept the plaintiff’s basis of $906 per week representing the plaintiff’s loss of past earnings (noting that average weekly earnings would be $1,100 per week) as a better guide than the defendant’s figure of $750 per week. The 2011 financial year should be ignored because that was the year of the injury, and when considering his previous net weekly earnings for 2009 ($906) and 2010 ($711), I have to take into account the nature of the plaintiff’s past work history. In those circumstances, I propose to regard the 2009 year as being the best estimate as to the earnings he should have enjoyed but for his injury.
	
	
	Applying the $906 to the calculation set out by the plaintiff, the revised calculation is as follows:
	


Period 1

Period 30/05/2011 – 10/10/2013

Period = 124 weeks

Plaintiff’s earnings = $nil

Comparable earnings = $906 net per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $906 x 124 = $112,344

Period 2

Period 11/10/2013 – 30/06/2014

Period = 37 weeks

Plaintiff total average net earnings for period $310 per week

Comparable earnings = $900 per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $596 x 37 = $22,052

Period 3

Period 01/07/2014 – 24/06/2015

Period = 51 weeks

Plaintiff’s total average net earnings for period $187 per week

Comparable earnings = $900 per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $719 x 51 = $36,669

Total = $171,065


	
	Accordingly, I award the plaintiff $171,065 for past economic loss.
	
	
	There being no dispute as to the percentage to apply to past superannuation (11%), accordingly, I award $18,817.15 for past loss of superannuation.
	


Future economic loss


	
	The significant issue in these proceedings is the plaintiff’s future economic loss. I will first set out the parties’ schedule of future loss of earnings.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s schedule of future loss of earnings is as follows:
	


Plaintiff born 28/12/1973

Plaintiff currently aged 41 years

Remaining working life = 26 years

5% multiplier for 26 years = 768.7

Earnings with defendant in 2011 = $710 net per week but defendants business failed

Plaintiff’s current average earnings = $187 per week

Plaintiff should be earning $1,000 net per week

Plaintiff’s loss = $813 per week

Accordingly $813 x 768.7 x 0.85 = $531,210


	
	The defendant submits the plaintiff’s future wage loss should be calculated as follows:
	


Future wage loss to 67 (s 151IA Workers Compensation Act)

25.5 years = 761.2

@ $350 per week

Less 15% = $226,456


	
	The evidence of the plaintiff and of his treating doctors, as well as the medico-legal reports, are set out above, and I do not need to repeat this evidence. As the principal issue in these proceedings is the plaintiff’s future economic loss, I propose to set out in detail my analysis of the medical evidence tendered on behalf of the defendant, which includes rehabilitation reports, a letter to Dr Cass about the plaintiff’s employability containing his handwritten notes, comments by Dr O’Keefe.
	


The defendant’s evidence on economic loss


	
	As noted above, I took the defendant’s evidence on economic loss into account when determining past economic loss, but have summarised that evidence in this section of the judgment.
	
	
	The defendant principally relies upon the answers of Dr Cass to the letter from independent injury solutions of 20 February 2013. In it, Dr Cass indicated that the plaintiff was capable of acting as a retail sales person (general, hardware, real estate, motor vehicle), sales representative and forklift operator. He was not capable of working in the job of a service station attendant. It was urged upon me that the “yes” underneath forklift operator must also apply to “security officer/gatekeeper”, which is number 4, but since Dr Cass has simply put a circle around “provide armed escort for payroll deliveries and written “possibility””, I struggle to see how he has answered “yes” when he has not put “yes” next to this question, although he has answered all the other questions individually.
	
	
	While I am prepared to accept that the general import of this unsatisfactory handwritten commentary amounts to acceptance of the plaintiff’s ability to work as a security officer, the report still suffers from the problem that Dr Cass has not exposed his reasons for coming to the conclusions identified as “yes” and “no”, and this must substantially detract from the report’s value. In the absence of a report from Dr Cass stating that the plaintiff is capable of working as a security officer maintaining crowd control, apprehending offenders, detecting and reporting fraud and shoplifting and working as a gatekeeper to monitor and authorise persons and vehicles entering and leaving, his conclusions have little value.
	
	
	By comparison, Dr O’Keefe (Exhibit 1) read Ms Monaghan’s reports, and it was in this context he pointed out Dr Milne’s failure to identify the plaintiff’s fixed flexion deformity. Dr O’Keefe notes that Ms Monaghan and her colleagues “have made various recommendations including that he work as a security guard which he is now doing”, he was dismissive of those proposals, stating that the plaintiff’s “educational levels and past experience” meant that “he is really only suited to clerical or sedentary work for which he is not trained” and that “for him to continue to work in the security industry would seem to be the most practical solution” (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that he had obtained only very limited work in the security industry, and that this work was the crowd control kind of work that it is generally agreed is dangerous for him to do. If he ever had to restrain anyone, he would be in real difficulties. The security firm he had worked for appeared to be aware of this, because he was rarely offered work.
	
	
	Mr Lidden SC submitted that the past was a good indicator of the future; the rehabilitation service had been unable to find work for the plaintiff in the past and the likelihood was that the plaintiff would be unable to find work for the future: Nominal Defendant v Livaja [2011] NSWCA 121. He had been earning very little, and in fact what little he had earned has largely been earned in work for which he was agreed to be unsuitable, namely working as a security guard in crowd control related jobs.
	
	
	Additionally, although Ms Monaghan has given lip service to the fact that the plaintiff lives in a rural area, in that there are references to jobs in Orange (some distance from the plaintiff’s home town of Blayney), these jobs seem inappropriate. The sales jobs require skills such as “a good phone manner”, “customer service skills”, and the plaintiff not only presents as someone who does not have those skills, but also lacks computer skills and does not have a computer at home.
	
	
	The defendant is required to establish not only what the plaintiff can do, but also that work is available. In this regard, Mr Lidden SC referred to Mead v Kerney [2012] NSWCA 215, where the plaintiff, who lived at Mudgee, was unable to find work in the area, to the extent where he considered moving out of the area to look for some kind of office work even though he had “never ever done office work” (at [11]). The problem was that he lived in a remote area where there was little work to be had. The trial judge in Mead v Kerney, having first determined the plaintiff’s theoretical work capacity, then considered whether the plaintiff could, at a practical matter, utilise that capacity to obtain work in the geographic area in which it was reasonable for him to seek work (Nominal Defendant v Livaja [2011] NSWCA 121). On appeal, this approach was considered correct.
	
	
	There must be a practical assessment of the plaintiff being able to in fact obtain jobs of the kind proposed by the rehabilitation reports, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in Mead v Kerney at [24]-[27]. Additionally, such work as is available to the plaintiff in the area in which he lives needs to be work with the kind of characteristics set out in Mead v Kerney at [30]; all of the factors set out there except the first factor (namely employability for no more than three hours a day) would apply.
	
	
	The plaintiff has worked his whole life as a manual labourer. He has, from my observation of him in the witness box, no transferable skills of any kind in any job where he would be required to deal with customers, serve in a shop or perform tasks which involves interaction with the public. He is, as Dr O’Keefe describes him, “a thickset individual with dark hair and tattoos, 6’1” in height, weighing 126kg” (Exhibit 1, report of 16 July 2014, page 3). He is inarticulate, has no (or only basic) computer skills and he lacks the ability, from my observation of him, to perform the sedentary jobs which are put forward.
	
	
	Although Ms Monaghan refers to the plaintiff as “pain focussed”, what does come out clearly through these reports is the plaintiff’s willingness to retrain and willingness to try. His willingness to consider careers such as real estate (vocational assessment report 28 March 2013, page 9) or sales representative are an indication of the same positive attitude he had shown to cooperate with medical practitioners in his treatment, but represent a complete lack of understanding of the skills limitations placed on him not so much by his work history but more by his lack of skills generally.
	
	
	As already noted, the plaintiff’s lack of computer skills is noted in a number of the reports, although inconsistently described as “below average” in the report of 28 March 2013 to being completely lacking, in that he needs to complete “a basic computer course to obtain computer skills” (page 19 of the same report), as he has no computer in his home. That kind of inconsistency in relation to such an important work skill must undermine the report. Similarly, Ms Monaghan failed to pick up that the plaintiff is driving a car one-handed, which might impact upon his employability as a forklift driver.
	
	
	Some of the advice contained in the vocational report is inappropriate for a person with the plaintiff’s limited work background. For example:
	


“To work as a sales representative in a specialised or technical area, Mr Hobby will usually need to undertake post-secondary study in that area. For example, chemical sales representatives often need tertiary or technical qualifications, plus experience, in fields such as science or engineering to work in industrial chemical sales.” (report 28 March 2013, page 14)


	
	There was a notation that there is “currently one position advertised in Orange for a sales representative” but it transpires that this is a global company requiring a sales representative for a three week contract. Applicants require good communication skills and a sales or customer service background (report 28 March 2013, page 15). Mr Hobby is described as having “transferable skills that may assist him to obtain employment in this area” and that Dr Cass has reported this as being “physically appropriate”.
	
	
	Similarly, in relation to the job of “security officer/gatekeeper”, there is a notation that the plaintiff needs to be physically fit and may be required to pass a medical examination. It is hard to see how the plaintiff could do so, and I note that there were, at the time of this report being prepared, no positions advertised for security work in Orange or Bathurst (report 28 March 2013, page 18).
	
	
	The report notes a number of barriers to employment. These included the fact that the plaintiff was pain focused, that he believed he would experience difficulty in obtaining employment due to his injuries, and that his transferrable skills were predominantly physical in nature.
	
	
	Finally, I note the tender of a summary of the plaintiff’s earnings since 23 April 2014 (Exhibit 3). He earned an average of $322 per week for Bear Security Pty Ltd for 27 weeks (23 June 2014 to 4 January 2015) and $169 per week for 5 weeks with Smith & Co Security (20 April to 25 May 2015). Much of this work was, however, work of the kind that the plaintiff should not be doing, in that it involves potential injuries. The plaintiff has not been able to obtain any other form of employment except this work as a security guard.
	


Conclusions concerning the plaintiff’s future economic loss


	
	I found Ms Monaghan’s report to be both superficial and unhelpful, and Dr Cass’s brief handwritten notes of little weight due to the lack of explanation. Dr O’Keefe’s comments about the plaintiff’s lack of suitability for sedentary work, and his view that the best solution is for the plaintiff to do security work, are helpful, but it must be noted that the plaintiff can really only perform static guard work, not crowd control, because he could not restrain a person, control a crowd or respond to danger satisfactorily.
	
	
	It is not that the plaintiff is unwilling to try; his willingness to participate is noted throughout Ms Monaghan’s report. However, in practical terms, there is no evidence of there being jobs fulfilling the criteria applicable to any employment for the plaintiff as at 2013 apart from the guard work which he really should not be doing. If the rehabilitation service cannot find such jobs, it is likely that the plaintiff would suffer the same problems.
	
	
	The plaintiff has had a long and active work history prior to the accident. He was eager to get back into the workforce as soon as he could. He made serious attempts to obtain employment and it was not put to him in cross-examination that any attempts he made were not genuine or that there were other practical steps that he could have taken to obtain employment. To the contrary, he sought and obtained employment in jobs that were actually dangerous. This is not a case where there has been a claim of failure to mitigate loss in relation to past employment, or of malingering in order to minimise his future employability.
	
	
	Without evidence that the plaintiff’s condition will improve, albeit accommodated by future employment markets, I cannot assume that his potential residual earning capacity will be of any significant use to him in the future. I note that evidence of the problems he had had between the obtaining of employment between the accident and the trial may be good indicators of current and future earning potential: Kallouf v Middis [2008] NSWCA 61.
	
	
	In the course of his closing submissions, Mr Lidden SC stated that “Nature does not help [the plaintiff]; there’s a reason why he does heavy manual work”. Without wanting to distress the plaintiff, I agree with these observations. His presentation and demeanour are really only suitable for guard work, but static guard work, or work in the console room (assuming he could operate the security cameras) has not been possible for him to find to date. While he has a strong work ethic, that is not enough. As an unskilled worker, it is clear, from the history of his attempts to obtain work to date, that he has been pushed to the back of the queue and is the casual employee of the last resort for the security firm that has offered him some limited employment since his injuries settled. The limits of that employability are, I am satisfied, best demonstrated by assuming that the plaintiff would earn less than $200 per week (Mr Lidden SC’s estimate is $187). In practical terms, he is always going to have difficulty finding work, especially as he grows older, and will have long periods of being unemployed, in the same way that he is doing now.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I accept Mr Lidden SC’s calculations for future economic loss, representing his earnings as being $1,000 net per week (his net of $710 per week just before the accident was the salary while working for a failing business about to go into liquidation, and thus not truly representative of his employability). I am satisfied, having regard to the salary the plaintiff has earned since his return to the work force, that an appropriate figure for current average weekly earnings is $187 per week. This makes his loss $813 per week.
	
	
	This will result in a total of $513,210 for future economic loss, taking into account the following:
	



	
	The plaintiff is currently aged 41 years (date of birth 28 December 1973) and has a remaining working life of 26 years. I note, on the defendant’s summary, that there is no challenge to the plaintiff’s retirement age of 67 (of Mead v Kerney at [49]);
	
	
	The 5% multiplier for 26 years is 768.7;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s loss is $813 per week;
	
	
	Vicissitudes of 15% must be allowed for;
	
	
	The calculation is therefore $813 x 768.7 x 0.85 = $531,201.
	


Future loss of superannuation


	
	The plaintiff submits loss of superannuation (for both past and future) should be calculated as follows:
	


Assume

Rate for past = 11% of net loss (0.11)

Rate for future for 26 years = 13.61% of net loss (0.1361)

Past

$169,793 x 0.11 = $18,677 [Note: this is dealt with in the section on past economic loss, as set above].

Future

$513,210 x 0.13 = $66,717

Total = $85,394


	
	The defendant does not cavil with 11% for past superannuation but submits loss of superannuation should be calculated as follows:
	


Future superannuation = $24,910 (Note: This has been calculated by applying 11% to the defendant’s proposed future economic loss sum of $226,456.)

Total = $39,650


	
	Mr Lidden SC referred to Najdovski v Crnojlovic (2008) 72 NSWLR 728, submitting that the percentage for future superannuation calculations should take into account the rises to the superannuation guarantee, while allowing for the government’s postponement of the relevant legislation by the government (which has resulted in his reducing the rate from 13.8% to 13%). Mr Rickard submitted the same rate should apply for future as for past superannuation.
	
	
	Future loss of superannuation as high as 14% has been awarded without comment: see, for example, Black v Young (2015) 70 MVR 174 at [36]. In the absence of a more compelling argument on behalf of the defendant, I see no reason why the rate of 13% should not be awarded.  
	


Fox v Wood


	
	The parties have agreed to a Fox v Wood component for $16,070.
	


Credit for weekly workers compensation payments


	
	The agreed sum for which the defendant is entitled to credit is $108,620.
	


Orders


	
	There was a mathematical error in the plaintiff’s total for damages due to uncertainty as to the precise Fox v Wood figure. Additionally, allowance must be made for the weekly workers compensation payments. Accordingly I will give judgment for the plaintiff and give the parties liberty to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting the mathematically agreed judgment sum. Liberty to apply in relation to costs has also been given.
	



	
	Judgment for the plaintiff.
	
	
	Liberty to the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting the mathematically agreed judgment sum.
	
	
	Defendant pay plaintiff’s costs.
	
	
	Liberty to restore in relation to costs.

		18 November 2015",2015-08-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702828,R v McNeil (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1198,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: Shaun McNeil (""the offender"") underwent a trial by jury earlier this year for the murder of Daniel Christie at Kings Cross on 31 December 2013. Upon his arraignment in the presence of the jury panel on 1 June he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown Prosecutor did not accept that plea in satisfaction of the indictment and so a jury was empanelled and the trial proceeded. On 11 June the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.
	
	
	The offender has also pleaded guilty to assaulting Peter Christie and causing him actual bodily harm and to assaulting a young person, JF. Those pleas were entered on arraignment on 5 December 2014 (and confirmed when he was re-arraigned on 21 August 2015).
	


Facts


	
	Daniel Christie, then 18 years of age, and his brother Peter Christie, then aged 20, were at Kings Cross on New Year's Eve 2013. They had travelled by train from the suburb in which they lived and on arriving at Kings Cross at about 7.15pm they went to the Kings Cross Hotel where they had some beers. They then went to the Empire Hotel where they had a game of pool and another beer. They then walked along Victoria Street on their way to the Soho nightclub to see if it was open. This was at around the time of the 9 o'clock New Year's Eve fireworks.
	
	
	The offender was also in the city that evening. He was with his girlfriend, Sonya Walker. They too had travelled into the city by train from the suburb in which they lived. They first went to a hotel in the city and then went to Kings Cross where they visited a friend at a backpackers' hostel. By the time of the incident in question the offender was reasonably intoxicated. He later told police, ""I've had too much to drink tonight"".
	
	
	Shortly after 9.00pm, the offender and Ms Walker were walking along Darlinghurst Road towards William Street. CCTV footage showed them stopping briefly whilst the offender shook hands and had brief exchanges with security guards outside some establishments as they approached the intersection with Victoria Street. Immediately prior to arriving at that intersection the offender stopped and had an exchange with a person he knew. It could be gleaned from the CCTV footage that the offender appeared to be in a buoyant mood. Mr Smith SC described him in his opening address to the jury as ""happy"".
	
	
	As the offender and Ms Walker came to the pedestrian crossing over Victoria Street they came across three young men, JF, TS and TG. The evidence of what transpired between them varied but it will suffice to say that there was a conversation initiated by the young persons in which the offender was offered drugs but said he was not interested. He later told police that comments were made about Ms Walker's appearance to which he took exception. He also claimed that Ms Walker had been pushed but that is not supported by any other evidence.
	
	
	Fighting broke out between the offender and the three young men. It included the offender being punched at least twice (he sustained a laceration to his inner upper lip). He punched JF, causing him to fall down on the pedestrian crossing, and then kicked him. One of the witnesses described the kick as ""savage"". The offender returned to where Ms Walker was standing on the footpath. She appeared to remonstrate with him and he returned and helped JF up to his feet. The Crown alleged that the offender then threw a punch at TG as he and JF moved down into Victoria Street. The offender went in that direction as well. There was no good reason for him doing so. Ms Walker was calling out loudly, (almost screaming she said), ""Come on Shaun, it's almost 9 o'clock, lets go. Just leave it, come on"".
	
	
	Daniel and Peter Christie were walking on the footpath in Victoria Street after having just turned right from Darlinghurst Road. They heard something and looked back and saw a person who Peter Christie described as ""fairly young"" (JF) sitting on the pedestrian crossing. They were sufficiently concerned to stop and watch what was happening. A short time later, there was a young person near to them who told them, ""This dude hit all of us"". Peter Christie saw a man (the offender) helping the young person on the crossing to get up. It was his perception that the offender then ""ushered"" or ""directed"" the young person down Victoria Street. As they came closer, Peter Christie heard the offender say to the young person in ""an aggressive sort [of] manner"", ""I'm an MMA fighter"". He described the offender as ""sort of like beefing up to look big""; “he physically looked aggressive, or had an aggressive stance"".
	
	
	According to JF, Daniel Christie asked the offender, ""Why are you hitting kids?"" Peter Christie gave evidence that as the offender came towards Daniel, the offender said something, not all of which Peter Christie heard. It commenced with ""If you think I'm a …"". Daniel Christie took a step back and put his hands up with his palms facing outwards and said, “No, no, no, no, no"". The offender then delivered a single punch to the face of Daniel Christie, likely to the left jaw. Daniel immediately went limp and fell backwards onto the roadway, striking the back of his head heavily. His brother said that he heard ""a very loud definite crack"".
	
	
	Peter Christie immediately challenged the offender as to what he was doing. For his trouble, he was punched to the mouth causing him to stumble back. He sustained a split lip which bled (later described as a ""full thickness lip laceration"" which required three sutures). Peter then turned and directed his attention to his brother while the offender walked back towards Darlinghurst Road.
	
	
	Uniformed police officers were quickly on the scene and the offender was arrested. Emergency aid was given to Daniel and he was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Efforts to save him were in vain. His life support system was turned off on 11 January 2014 and he died.
	
	
	The offender was interviewed at the Kings Cross police station. He gave an account which was to the effect that he had been assaulted by a number of young men at the crossing. When he went down into Victoria Street he thought he was going to be attacked by more people in the same group so he responded by delivering a single punch. (There was a question as to whether he was talking about the punch to Daniel Christie or the later punch to Peter Christie but I am satisfied he was talking about the former.) When detectives eventually told the offender that the person he had punched was not part of the group of young persons he immediately looked anguished and admitted that he was in the wrong. He apologised repeatedly. His remorse appeared to be genuine.
	


Personal circumstances of the offender


	
	The offender was aged 25 at the relevant time and is now 27. His parents separated when he was an infant and he had no meaningful relationship with his biological father. His mother and stepfather are supportive of him.
	
	
	He left school in Year 11 and has generally been employed in hospitality, construction and removals.
	
	
	There is a history of drug and alcohol abuse. He gave an account to Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, of binge drinking alcohol on weekends when he was in his late teenage years. He claimed to have stopped for a while but drank on most weekends when he was aged 20 and 21. He commenced a relationship with Ms Sonya Walker when he was about 21 and claimed that she ""changed his life"". He told the doctor that he consumed only a minimal amount of alcohol in recent years. However, he was using the drug known as ""ice"" in 2011 to 2013, albeit only on weekends, and had previously used ecstasy. He denied any major impairment from drug use and spoke of working long hours with his stepfather.
	
	
	The offender also gave an account to Dr Furst of mental health issues. He provided a history of anxiety and depression from the age of 12. He experienced panic attacks. He regarded himself as ""sensitive and vulnerable"". There was an admission to a psychiatric unit in 2009 following a suicide attempt. At the time of seeing Dr Furst (April 2014) he was being prescribed Seroquel which the doctor said appeared to be for his anxiety and adjustment issues.
	
	
	Dr Furst said that there were no indications of the offender suffering from a depressive disorder in the weeks preceding the offences or on the day of the offences. The offender told him that he was ""having a good night"".
	
	
	The offender told Dr Furst that he had become more ""spiritual"" since being in custody. He said that he prayed for the Christie family and for Ms Walker. He attended church meetings on Thursdays. There was also material tendered to the Court indicating that the offender had been gainfully employed doing maintenance work at his gaol. He had completed a drug and alcohol program as well as vocation, literacy and numeracy courses. He has not had any disciplinary infractions and he is reported to be a hard-working, polite and very helpful inmate. He has expressed a desire to participate in a leadership position in young offenders programs.
	
	
	A letter under the hand of Sister Marcia Cox, the Chaplain at the Parklea Correctional Centre, speaks highly of the offender. She says “he seems to have a passion to learn and a personal mission to become the best person he can become”. She says “he lives with the fact his lack of self-control resulted in a young man losing his life and the terrible pain the young man’s family live with each day. He prays each day for the Christie family and dreams one day of forgiveness and inner healing for both families”. She describes him as “by far the most sincere and self-motivated person to seek change and become a better person for himself, family and society” of all the inmates with whom she engages.
	
	
	Dr Furst was told that the offender and his family had received death threats due to the extensive media coverage of the case. He said this added to his level of stress and anxiety and he was in a form of protective custody.
	
	
	Dr Furst made the diagnoses of ""substance use disorder (alcohol abuse, amphetamine abuse)""; ""alcohol intoxication (on the night of 31/12/13)""; and ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood"". He noted the history of anxiety and depression but said that it was not to a degree of causing functional impairment of work and relationships to a point that warranted a psychiatric diagnosis. Recommendations were made that the offender remains engaged with psychological services. Anger management and/or the Violent Offenders Treatment Program as well as structured drug and alcohol counselling and/or rehabilitation were indicated. Dr Furst also made a recommendation about the use of an antidepressant medication.
	
	
	The offender's mother and stepfather provided affidavits in which they confirmed their continued support for him. They, of course, seem to be devastated about his actions on New Year's Eve 2013 and expressed quite sincere empathy for the Christie family.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal history in New South Wales and Queensland that commenced when he was aged 18. Notable entries include the following:
	


June 2006: Assault and Contravene apprehended domestic violence order (12 month good behaviour bonds)

April 2008: Commit public nuisance (fine)

May 2008: Fail to leave licensed premises (fine)

February 2009: Assault and Contravene apprehended domestic violence order (6 month suspended sentences of imprisonment)

June 2010: Possess dangerous drugs (fine)

May 2011: Assault and Custody of knife in public place (good behaviour bond (with supervision and a requirement to obey directions in relation to counselling, education development or drug and alcohol rehabilitation) and a fine)

July 2011: Possess prohibited drug (fine)

December 2011: Assault (domestic violence related) (12 month good behaviour bond)


	
	The offender breached the bond that was imposed for the assault committed in May 2011 on account of his failure to comply with the supervision requirement. He was called up and resentenced to a fine. On the same occasion he was dealt with for the assault committed in December 2011 and placed on a bond. His response to supervision under that bond was chequered, to say the least. When the period of the bond expired his file was endorsed with notations to the effect that his response had been unsatisfactory; he had failed to undertake any form of intervention in relation to anger management; and he was ""unsuitable for future orders"". The offender's later claim to Dr Furst that he attended an anger management course as well as drug and alcohol counselling, generally fortnightly, throughout 2013 according to the terms of this bond was obviously false.
	
	
	A handwritten letter by the offender was tendered. It purports to be an expression of his remorse. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I should give it no weight having regard to the fact that the offender has not given any evidence in the proceedings. I am not persuaded that he is remorseful on the basis of this letter.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	Self-defence was left as an issue for the jury to consider because of what the offender told police in his interview. But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he should be sentenced for the manslaughter on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act rather than on the basis of excessive self-defence.
	
	
	I accept that the offender was not in Kings Cross on New Year’s Eve 2013 looking for trouble, let alone that he had any intention to act violently towards anyone. In this respect the case is quite different to R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 which at first blush might appear to be a strikingly similar case. The attack upon the deceased in that case occurred in almost the exact same spot as the attack in the present case and involved a single punch which caused death by an intoxicated offender. But in that case, the Court of Criminal Appeal described the offender’s behaviour (at [168]) as involving the “repeated and random selection of victims whom he attacked to the head in a public street for no reason”. (R v Loveridge is distinguishable in a number of other ways, including the fact that the offender there was on conditional liberty imposed only a short time before in respect of another incident involving “serious and indiscriminate violence” (at [203]) fuelled by alcohol.)
	
	
	In the present case, the offender was undoubtedly intoxicated, but he was in a buoyant mood and, at a relatively early hour of the evening, he was intent on leaving Kings Cross and going home. It was the unexpected interactions with the three young persons at the intersection of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street that precipitated the sudden explosion of a violent response by the offender directed towards a person he mistakenly thought was part of the same group. His action was reactive to the immediately preceding events rather than indicative of him acting in a manner that was premeditated.
	
	
	This should not be regarded as in any way condoning or excusing the offender’s violent response. He was not provoked to do what he did. After the interaction with the young men on the corner of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street he could have proceeded with Ms Walker on their intended journey along Darlinghurst Road. But he decided that the incident was not concluded and he chose to go down into Victoria Street. With a mind addled by alcohol, he completely misconceived the situation there and gave vent to a perceived, but grossly mistaken, need to violently punish an innocent young man.
	
	
	Even with a perception that Daniel Christie was part of the group of young men, he was offering the offender no threat. The offender was a strongly built man who was trained with body building to develop his strength and physique. He told police he was trained in UFC fighting. Daniel Christie was no match for him. His last actions before he was struck were to step back and put his hands up in a pacifying way. But the offender struck him unnecessarily and without warning. The descriptions in the trial of the blow delivered by the offender varied but on any view it was a ferocious blow delivered by a powerfully built man. The submission by Mr Smith that the offender was angry and emotional, in the context of being intoxicated, after the initial incident with the three young men is accepted. I would add that his actions were cowardly.
	
	
	The offender’s intoxication is not something I take into account as in any way excusing or lessening his culpability for his crime. Its only relevance is to serve as part of the explanation for what occurred. And, as his history shows, it is not as if violence is out of character for the offender.
	
	
	Mr Smith conceded on behalf of the offender that I would find that this is an extremely serious example of involuntary manslaughter, which I do. He sought, however, to distinguish it from certain other similarly serious cases when regard is had to the genesis of the incident. I accept that there are differences. As was observed in R v Loveridge (at [215]), the circumstances of these types of cases vary widely and the focus must be on the particular case at hand.
	
	
	The assault occasioning actual bodily harm of Peter Christie is obviously a less serious offence but as offences of that nature go it is no trivial matter. The seriousness of that offence is enhanced by virtue of the context in which it occurred.
	
	
	The assault upon JF, involving a blow that caused the young man to go to the ground followed immediately by a kick, is a serious example of that type of offence.
	


Other sentence considerations


	
	The offender's criminal history is something that I regard as denying to him any leniency that could otherwise have been extended absent such a history.
	
	
	I am prepared to find that the offender is probably sorry for what he has done and the harm that he has caused. This is not based upon the letter that was tendered. I have in mind his immediate acceptance of wrongdoing once he was made aware at the end of his police interview that he had seriously assaulted and caused grave injury to a completely innocent young man. It is not only what he said but his whole demeanour at that point which was quite striking. The continued and consistent acknowledgement of his wrongdoing thereafter is also indicative of remorse. I had the advantage, which most did not, of watching him face on in the court room throughout the trial and also noted his demeanour through the course of the sentence hearing. There was nothing that I observed that tended against acceptance of his sorrow.
	
	
	The offender's past violence, albeit nowhere near approaching the severity of the present matter, combined with his relatively poor response to supervision, augurs rather badly in terms of his prospects of rehabilitation. However, it must be said that his performance over the past 18 months or so whilst he has been in custody suggests a more positive prognosis. There is much to be said for him engaging in rehabilitation services available in the custodial environment, such as the Violent Offenders Treatment Program suggested by Dr Furst. I cannot conclude that his prospects of rehabilitation are ""good""; but I do accept that they are reasonable. I am unable to find that he is unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	Denunciation of the offender's conduct, retribution and general deterrence are prominent considerations in the assessment of sentence in a case such as this. In the light of what I said a moment ago, personal deterrence must also be a significant consideration.
	
	
	It was common ground and I accept that the sentences to be imposed should be reduced by 25 per cent on account of the offender's indication pre-committal that he would plead guilty to manslaughter and the two assaults. The offender's position in this respect has been consistent and it was, in effect, the manner in which his case was presented to the jury.
	
	
	It was accepted on the offender's behalf that some accumulation of sentences is appropriate but there was an issue between the parties as to the extent of it. On account of there being three offences, each concerning a separate victim, the concession as to accumulation is correct. I acknowledge the need to bear in mind the principle of totality.
	
	
	I propose to impose an aggregate sentence. It will be backdated to 31 December 2013 when the offender first came into custody.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should find that there are special circumstances which would justify lengthening the parole period of the sentence at the expense of the non-parole component. I have factored into the assessment of sentence all relevant aspects of the offender's subjective case and see no additional value in them that would justify such a course.
	


Family member victim impact statements


	
	Two remarkable statements by Daniel Christie's mother and father were provided to the Court. Maureen Christie chose not to read her statement, which I well understand and it does not have any less impact for that reason. What they have written are powerful and very moving expressions of love, loss and a grief that will never pass.
	
	
	I am indebted to Mrs and Mr Christie for describing for me what a remarkable young man their son Daniel was. His death is a loss not only to his family and his friends but to the entire community. We are all the poorer for it. It is my regret that I cannot do more than acknowledge the grief and loss and extend my most sincere sympathy.
	


Orders


	
	Convicted in respect of each offence.
	
	
	If not for the imposition of an aggregate sentence I would have imposed a sentence of 6 months for the assault upon JF, 1 year 6 months for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Peter Christie, and 9 years for the manslaughter of Daniel Christie. Each of those terms have been reduced by 25 per cent from what they otherwise would have been because of the pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 31 December 2013. The non-parole period will expire on 30 June 2021. The offender will become eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

2702831,R v Alqudsi; Alqudsi v Commonwealth of Australia [2015] NSWSC 1222,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Hamdi Alqudsi (the plaintiff) has been committed for trial in New South Wales for offences against s 7(1)(e) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth) (the Act). The Crown case against the plaintiff is that between 25 June 2013 and 14 October 2013 he provided assistance to seven men who travelled to Syria to engage in armed hostilities against the government of Syria. It is alleged that he helped the men by providing them both with instructions (which included measures to be taken to avoid detection by security officials) and support to travel from Australia to Syria via Turkey. It is also alleged that the plaintiff acted as a conduit for information between the seven men and his contact in Syria, Mohommad Ali Baryalei.
	
	
	The plaintiff challenges the constitutional validity of s 7(1)(e), which makes it a criminal offence, punishable by the law of Australia, for a person to provide certain forms of assistance with the intention of supporting or promoting incursions into foreign States to engage, or with intent to engage, in hostile activity there. The powers relied on to support the legislation are those conferred by s 51(xxix) and s 51(vi) of the Constitution, that is, the powers to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to external affairs and defence respectively. To the extent to which it was required, the Commonwealth also relied on s 51(xxxix) (the incidental power) and the implied incidental power.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that the Court cannot be satisfied that s 7(1)(e) of the Act, in its relevant operation with s 6(1)(a) and s 6(3)(aa), has more than a remote, fortuitous or insubstantial connection with either the external affairs or the defence of the Commonwealth and thus it is beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth.
	


Procedural matters


	
	The plaintiff was committed for trial by the Local Court on 21 November 2014. On 27 January 2015 Bathurst CJ granted an exemption under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to enable the indictment to be presented in this Court. On 8 May 2015 the plaintiff was arraigned before Johnson J, on seven charges (the criminal proceedings). A not guilty plea was entered in respect of each charge. The first charge on the indictment was that the plaintiff:
	


“Between about 25 June and 14 October 2013, at Sydney, in the State of NSW, did perform services for another person, namely Tyler Casey (also known as Abu Qaqa), with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against section 6 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978, being the entry by that person into a foreign State, namely Syria, with intent to engage in a hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria.”


	
	The remaining charges are in similar terms save for the name of the person for whom services were allegedly provided. In the second charge such person was said to be Caner Temel (also known as Abu Moussa); in the third, Mehmet Biber (also known as Abu Abdul Malik); in the fourth, Muhammad Abdul-Karim Musleh (also known as Abu Hassan); in the fifth, Mahmoud Abed Aboshi (also known as Abu Alem); in the sixth, Amin Mohamed (also known as Abu Bilal); and in the seventh, Nassim Elbahsa.
	
	
	At the time of the alleged offending, the plaintiff, who was born in Jordan, was an Australian citizen, having attained citizenship on 11 November 1987. Each of the seven persons for whom he is alleged to have performed services was an Australian citizen and was ordinarily resident in Australia.
	
	
	On 8 May 2015 the trial of the plaintiff in the criminal proceedings was fixed for hearing to commence on 21 September 2015 with an estimate of six weeks.
	
	
	On 18 June 2015 the plaintiff filed a writ of summons in the High Court against the Commonwealth seeking a declaration that s 7(1)(e) of the Act was invalid (the declaratory proceedings). By notice of motion filed in this Court, he sought a vacation of the hearing date and a stay of the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the declaratory proceedings. Subsequently, the plaintiff sought that the criminal proceedings be removed into the High Court. The Commonwealth filed a summons in the High Court for an order that the declaratory proceedings be remitted to this Court. On 20 July 2015 the High Court refused the plaintiff’s application that the criminal proceedings be removed into the High Court and ordered that the declaratory proceedings be remitted to this Court.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion in this Court for orders that the indictment dated 7 May 2015 be quashed, that these proceedings be permanently stayed and that the declaratory proceedings be heard together with the motion to quash the indictment in the criminal proceedings. This Court made orders on 30 July 2015 that the plaintiff’s motion to quash the indictment be heard together with his claim for declaratory relief.
	
	
	The issues in both proceedings were defined by an amended points of claim filed on behalf of the plaintiff on 7 August 2015 and responses filed on behalf of the Commonwealth on 11 August 2015 and on behalf of the Crown (represented by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions) on 12 August 2015. Written submissions were filed pursuant to directions. The Crown in the criminal proceedings adopted the submissions made by the Commonwealth in the declaratory proceedings.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing, the plaintiff was granted leave to claim the following alternative declaratory relief in the declaratory proceedings:
	


“A declaration that s 7(1)(e) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth) is invalid insofar as it purports to proscribe the performance of services in Australia with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against s 6(1)(a) read with s 6(3)(aa).”

The Crown case


	
	The Crown Case Statement in the criminal proceedings alleges in part that:
	



	
	the plaintiff has facilitated the travel of Australian citizens and residents from Australia to Syria, via Turkey, to fight in the armed hostilities against the Syrian Government in order to remove the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, from power;
	
	
	between 25 June 2013 and November 2013, the plaintiff provided instructions and support to seven men (the persons named in the seven charges in the indictment), each of whom is said to have departed Australia in the relevant period and none of whom is said to have returned to Australia;
	
	
	the plaintiff performed a clear liaison and advisory role between these persons and Mohommad Ali Baryalei (also known as Abu Omar), who is said to be a Syrian contact, and who is said to have left Australia for Tokyo on 10 April 2013 and, as at 30 November 2013, had not returned.
	



	
	The Crown also alleges:
	


“The accused confirmed the travel movements and the meeting details overseas which clearly indicated the individuals were to join the front line with the fighting forces in Syria. The accused also advised and instructed the individuals about hotel accommodation, appropriate currencies, solving problems with security overseas, provided a Syrian contact number for the individuals and also provided general encouragement and support.”


	
	The offence is said to have been committed by the performance of a service (s 7(1)(e)), intending another person to enter a foreign State (s 6(1)(a)) with intent to engage in armed hostilities in that State (s 6(3)(aa)). Thus, the charges against the plaintiff rely on the operation of s 7(1)(e) with ss 6(1)(a) and 6(3)(aa).
	
	
	The Crown case is largely based on telephone intercepts and messages between the plaintiff and the seven men named in the indictment. For present purposes it is not necessary to set out in any greater detail the nature of the Crown case or the evidence to be relied upon in support of it.
	


The Act and its legislative history


	
	At the time of the alleged offences, the relevant provisions were contained within the Act. The Act has since been repealed and the relevant provisions incorporated (with some alteration) within Division 119 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code).
	
	
	The Act had its genesis in a bill which was the subject of a Second Reading Speech on 17 March 1977. Mr Ellicott, the then Attorney-General, identified the objective of prohibiting persons preparing for, or engaging in, foreign incursions. He identified inadequacy in existing law and said:
	


“In all the circumstances, including the need to preserve international relations, there is a need for legislation to deal specifically with the problem, including preparations in Australia for these activities.”


	
	The original bill lapsed with that Parliament. Another bill was brought forward subsequently, which contained amendments as a result of recommendations made by the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The new bill included a definition of “government” in cl 3, which was defined as meaning the government recognised by Australia as the lawful government. It also contained what became s 6(4) and s 9(2) (see below).
	
	
	The Act was originally passed in 1978 and given royal assent on 14 April 1978.
	


Sections 6 and 7 of the Act


	
	At the time of the alleged offending, s 7 of the Act, so far as is material, provided:
	


“Preparations for incursions into foreign States for purpose of engaging in hostile activities

(1) A person shall not, whether within or outside Australia:

. . .

(e) give money or goods to, or perform services for, any other person . . . with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against section 6;

. . .

(1A) A reference in subsection (1) to the commission of an offence against section 6 is a reference to the doing of an act that would constitute, or would but for subsection 6(2) constitute, an offence against section 6.

(1B) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section merely because of doing an act by way of, or for the purposes of, the provision of aid of a humanitarian nature.

(2) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section in respect of the doing of an act outside Australia unless:

(a) at the time of the doing of that act, the person:

(i) was an Australian citizen; or

(ii) not being an Australian citizen, was ordinarily resident in Australia; or

(b) the person was present in Australia at any time before the doing of that act and, at any time when the person was so present, his or her presence was for a purpose connected with that act, or for purposes that included such a purpose.”


	
	Section 6 of the Act relevantly provided:
	


“Incursions into foreign States with intention of engaging in hostile activities

(1) A person shall not:

(a) enter a foreign State with intent to engage in a hostile activity in that foreign State; or

(b) engage in a hostile activity in a foreign State.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years.

(2) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section unless:

(a) at the time of the doing of the act that is alleged to constitute the offence, the person:

(i) was an Australian citizen; or

(ii) not being an Australian citizen, was ordinarily resident in Australia; or

(b) the person was present in Australia at any time before the doing of that act and, at any time when the person was so present, his or her presence was for a purpose connected with that act, or for purposes that included such a purpose.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), engaging in a hostile activity in a foreign State consists of doing an act with the intention of achieving any one or more of the following objectives (whether or not such an objective is achieved):

(a) the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State;

(aa) engaging in armed hostilities in the foreign State;

(b) causing by force or violence the public in the foreign State to be in fear of suffering death or personal injury;

(c) causing the death of, or bodily injury to, a person who:

(i) is the head of state of the foreign State; or

(ii) holds, or performs any of the duties of, a public office of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State; or

(d) unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal property belonging to the government of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State.

(4) Nothing in this section applies to an act done by a person in the course of, and as part of, the person’s service in any capacity in or with:

(a) the armed forces of the government of a foreign State; or

(b) any other armed force in respect of which a declaration by the Minister under subsection 9(2) is in force.

. . .”

The 1987 Amending Act


	
	The Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987 (Cth) (the 1987 Amending Act) effected various amendments, including the addition of s 6(3)(aa). It was given royal assent on 16 December 1987. In the Second Reading Speech Senator Tate explained the purpose of the amendments in the following terms:
	


“The underlying purpose of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 is to prevent persons from Australia becoming involved in hostile activity in overseas countries. The purpose of the amendments is to remedy a number of deficiencies in the Act. One such deficiency is that mercenary acts as such are not proscribed unless they involve acts done for specific purposes, those purposes generally relating to acts directed against the government of a foreign country. . . . In addition, two new offences have been created - prohibiting persons from Australia from engaging in armed hostilities outside Australia and prohibiting the use of a vessel or aircraft in preparations for an incursion into an overseas country. . . .

Other amendments are designed to meet a number of difficulties in relation to prosecutions under the Act involving the preparation for or incursion into an overseas country. Those . . . amend section 7 of the Act, which prohibits preparations for incursions into an overseas country, to ensure that proof of an offence against that section does not depend on proof of an offence against section 6, which prohibits such incursions by a person from Australia.”


	
	I understand the reference to “mercenary acts as such” in the Second Reading Speech to the 1987 Amending Act to be a reference to s 6(3)(aa), which proscribes “engaging in hostilities in the foreign State”. As the plain meaning of the section is broader than the term used in the Second Reading Speech, I do not understand Senator Tate as intending to confine the mischief which the amendment was designed to remedy to the acts of mercenaries as defined by the Geneva Convention (see below).
	
	
	The amendment to s 7 (which became s 7(1A)) referred to in the last paragraph of the passage extracted above was said, according to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill which became the 1987 Amending Act, to have the effect that:
	


“an Australian can be prosecuted for soliciting money or goods for the purpose of supporting the acts of other persons that are done with the object of overthrowing a government outside Australia even if those persons are not Australian and have no connection with Australia.”


	
	The 1987 Amending Act also removed the reference to “foreign country” and substituted “foreign State” and redefined “government” to mean the authority exercising effective control, rather than, as previously, the government that Australia had recognised as the lawful government.
	


Other provisions of the Act and the Criminal Code


	
	Section 5 of the Act excludes from its operation any act done by a person in the course of that person’s duty to the Commonwealth in relation to the defence of Australia.
	
	
	Sections 8 and 9 of the Act proscribe various kinds of recruitment to engage in armed hostilities in foreign States. Section 9(2) empowers (but does not require) the Minister to make declarations exempting specified armed forces from the prohibition in s 9(1). Section 9(2) provides:
	


“If the Minister has, by instrument signed by the Minister and published in the Gazette, declared that it is in the interests of the defence or international relations of Australia to permit the recruitment in Australia, either generally or in particular circumstances or subject to specified conditions, of persons to serve in or with a specified armed force, or to serve in or with a specified armed force in a particular capacity, subsection (1) does not apply, or does not apply in those circumstances or where those conditions are complied with, as the case may be, to or in relation to recruitment to serve, or the publication of an advertisement containing information with respect to service, in or with that armed force, or in or with that armed force in that capacity, as the case may be.”


	
	By reason of s 6(4)(b), acts done in the course of and as part of a person’s service in a capacity in or with an armed force which is the subject of a s 9(2) declaration, are not proscribed by s 6(1). The conditions for making a declaration under s 9(2) are not tailored to offences under s 6(1), since all that is required is that the Minister declare that it is in the interest of Australia’s defence or international relations that recruitment (as opposed to engaging in armed hostilities) be permitted.
	
	
	In 2004 the Act was amended to qualify the exception in s 6(4) of the Act and to make provision for “prescribed organisations”, which include “terrorist organisations”. These provisions were related to provisions in the Criminal Code which were considered in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 which is addressed below, both in the context of constitutional fact evidence and in connection with the ambit of the external affairs power.
	
	
	Section 3A of the Act makes applicable Ch 2 of the Criminal Code, which sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility. In respect of each offence the Crown must prove the existence of such physical elements as are relevant to establishing guilt and also a fault element.
	
	
	Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code also proscribes various orthodox types of extended criminal responsibility such as attempt (s 11.1); complicity and common purpose (s 11.2); incitement (s 11.4); and conspiracy (s 11.5). Section 11.6(2) of the Criminal Code provides that a reference in a law of the Commonwealth to a particular offence includes a reference to an offence against s 11.1 (attempt), 11.4 (incitement) or 11.5 (conspiracy). This section is subject to express or implied contrary intention. It was not suggested that there was any such contrary intention. Accordingly, I take it to be common ground that the reference in s 7(1)(e) to an offence against s 6 of the Act would include an attempt, incitement or conspiracy to commit an offence against s 6.
	


Constitutional fact evidence

Relevance of constitutional fact evidence


	
	The Commonwealth’s primary submission was that it was not necessary for it to rely on evidence of constitutional fact since s 7(1)(e) could plainly be characterised as a law with respect to external affairs and therefore a valid exercise of the Commonwealth’s legislative power under s 51(xxix). Nonetheless it tendered a bundle of material said to amount to evidence of constitutional fact, which comprised: the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter); various resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly; international texts; and current material containing the Australian Government’s Counter-Terrorism policy.
	
	
	The nature of constitutional fact evidence was addressed by Gageler J in Maloney v The Queen [2013] HCA 28; 252 CLR 168 at 299 and Heydon J in Thomas v Mowbray at [614] – [618] and [620] – [639]. When considering such material, the court is not constrained by the rules of evidence; the evidence need not be “official”. As Gageler J said at [353] of Maloney v The Queen:
	


“Subject to the requirements of procedural fairness inherent in the judicial process, the ultimate criterion governing the use of information from any source is that a court is able to consider the material sufficiently probative of the legislative fact to be found.”

The plaintiff’s objections


	
	The plaintiff objected to such of the constitutional fact material as post-dated the enactment of the Act in 1978 and the amendments that introduced s 6(3)(aa) in 1987, on the basis of the well-established principle that the validity of an Act must be tested as at the date of royal assent: Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 192 per Dixon J, at 268 per Fullagar J and 275 per Kitto J. The plaintiff also objected to such of the material relied on by the Commonwealth as constitutional fact evidence that post-dated the charges on the indictment.
	
	
	The post-royal assent material included international law texts, Oppenheim’s International Law (Longman, 9th ed, 1992) (Oppenheim), and an entry entitled “Mercenaries” in Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (Elsevier, 1997). The international law texts deal with the law as it has developed over time up to the date of publication. Accordingly, their contents largely pertain to the period prior to royal assent and can therefore be taken into account.
	
	
	The balance of the post-royal assent material included UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (24 September 2014) as well as current material relating to counter-terrorism. I do not consider that it ought influence the finding of constitutional facts since it is by no means clear that the later material relates back to the relevant period.
	


Summary of constitutional fact evidence

The UN Charter and the principle of non-intervention


	
	The Commonwealth relied on Art 2 of the UN Charter which prohibits the threat or use of force otherwise than in accordance with the purposes of the UN, which are expressed to include, in Art 1.1:
	


“To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;”


	
	The Commonwealth expressly relied on Art 2.4, which provides:
	


“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”


	
	The Commonwealth also relied generally on the so-called “non-intervention” principle by which States are prohibited from interfering in each other’s internal affairs, to which Art 2.4 is relevant (although it does not cover the field). The Commonwealth referred to Oppenheim at [122] to support the proposition that a State’s obligation not to intervene in another State’s internal affairs extended to neither encouraging nor tolerating such interference on the part of others within its territory. The authors of Oppenheim said at 394:
	


“. . . there is little room for doubt [about a State’s obligation to prohibit] where the subversive activities of private persons in a state take the form of organising on its territory armed hostile expeditions against another state. A state is bound not to allow its territory to be used for such hostile expeditions, and must suppress and prevent them. Some states have legislation which is wide enough to apply to some aspects of the preparation of hostile expeditions and the recruitment of persons to serve in armed expeditions abroad.”


	
	The footnote to the last sentence in the extracted passage includes a reference to the Act. The customary international law was articulated in the following passage from Oppenheim at 396 - 397:
	


“A state’s obligation to prevent hostile expeditions from its territory, and itself to refrain, directly or indirectly through organisations receiving from it financial or other assistance or closely associated with it by virtue of the state’s constitution, from engaging in or actively supporting subversive activities against another state have often been stated.”

Resolutions of the UN Security Council and General Assembly prior to the date of royal assent


	
	The authors of Oppenheim also referred, at 397, to the General Assembly’s Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States (the Friendly Relations Declaration) in which the General Assembly (by General Assembly Resolution 2625 (1970)) “Solemnly proclaims the following principles”:
	


“The principle that States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations

. . . 

Every State has the duty to refrain from organising or encouraging the organisation of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.

Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.

. . .

The principle concerning the duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, in accordance with the Charter

. . .

Also, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State.”

[Emphasis added in bold; italics in original.]


	
	The evidence also included the text of several resolutions of the UN Security Council and General Assembly. It is not necessary to identify each resolution relied upon. Resolutions 161 (1961), 169 (1961), 226 (1966), 239 (1967) and 241 (1967) were made in response to the conflict in the Congo. The resolutions requested States not only to refrain from the supply of arms to those in that area, but also to prevent their nationals from doing the same, except where authorised by the UN.
	
	
	Some of these resolutions referred exclusively to “mercenaries”, whereas others referred to foreign fighters more generally. For example, Security Council Resolution 161 relevantly:
	


“2.   Urges that measures be taken for the immediate withdrawal and evacuation from the Congo of all Belgian and other foreign military and paramilitary personnel and political advisers not under the United Nations Command, and mercenaries.”


	
	Security Council Resolution 169 (24 November 1961) authorised the Secretary-General to act to remove from the Republic of the Congo “all foreign military and paramilitary personnel and political advisers not under the UN Command, and mercenaries”.
	
	
	However, other resolutions, such as Resolution 239, referred only to mercenaries. Its terms included the following:
	


“2.   Condemns any State which persists in permitting or tolerating the recruitment of mercenaries, and the provision of facilities to them, with the objective of overthrowing the Governments of States Members of the United Nations.”


	
	Resolution 239 was reaffirmed by Resolution 405 (1977) in response to unrest in Benin. Resolution 405 was similarly confined to mercenaries, as appears from the following extract:
	


“5.   Further calls upon all States to consider taking necessary measures to prohibit, under their respective domestic laws, the recruitment, training and transit of mercenaries on their territory and other territories under their control.

6.   Condemns all forms of external interference in the internal affairs of Member States, including the use of international mercenaries to destabilize States and/ or violate their territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.”

The relevance of the meaning of the term “mercenaries”


	
	There was an issue about the meaning of the term “mercenaries” and whether its customary international law meaning differed from the convention meaning. It was accepted that the term, as provided for by the Geneva Red Cross Convention (which entered into force on 7 December 1978, but which had been approved by Resolution 2625 (24 October 1970)), was defined to mean any person who: (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) is motivated by private gain, which is substantially in excess of the remuneration paid to regular forces; (d) is neither a national or a party to the conflict or a resident of territory controlled by such a party; (e) is not a member of the armed forces or a party to the conflict; and (f) has not been sent by a non-party State as a member of its armed forces.
	
	
	The plaintiff contended that references in other material to “mercenaries” was confined to those falling within the definition referred to above, of which a salient feature was that the person be motivated by private gain. He observed that there was no suggestion that he, or any of the persons for whom he was alleged to have performed services, were motivated by private gain. He submitted that international concern about mercenaries could not be extended to include concern about foreign fighters generally, or persons described as “terrorists” since such persons did not fall within the definition of mercenaries.
	
	
	The Commonwealth submitted that the international concern was not limited to persons who were, strictly speaking, mercenaries. It particularly relied on the wording of Resolutions 161 and 169 (set out above) because the categories of persons in respect of whom States were required to arrange immediate withdrawal was not limited to “mercenaries” and also included “foreign military and paramilitary personnel”. It contended that mercenaries (even if the convention definition applied) were merely members of the broader genus of “foreign fighters”. Moreover, the Commonwealth argued that there was no reason to differentiate mercenaries from other foreign armed persons who were neither authorised by the UN nor belonging to a State’s armed forces, since what was at stake was the non-intervention principle which did not involve any particular aversion to foreign fighters who were motivated by financial gain, as opposed to foreign fighters generally.
	


Post-royal assent resolutions of the UN Security Council and General Assembly


	
	On 24 September 2014, after the period specified in respect of the charges on the indictment, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2178 which:
	


“6.   Recalls its decision, in resolution 1373 (2001), that all Member States shall ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, and decides that all States shall ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish serious criminal offenses sufficient to provide the ability to prosecute and to penalize in a manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offense:

(a) their nationals who travel or attempt to travel to a State other than their States of residence or nationality, and other individuals who travel or attempt to travel from their territories to a State other than their States of residence or nationality, for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts, or the providing or receiving of terrorist training;”


	
	Although Resolutions such as 2178 use the language of “terrorism” and “terrorists”, it appears that these terms are regarded as being within the same genus as “international mercenaries” or “foreign fighters” used in earlier resolutions, even if the term “international mercenaries” continues to be confined to its convention definition.
	
	
	The terms of Resolution 2178 hark back to, and restate, Resolution 1373. Accordingly, I would read the resolutions as indicating a continuing concern from 2001, being the date of the earlier resolution, extending up to and beyond the date of the charges in the indictment. However, as Resolution 1373 post-dates the relevant royal assents, it cannot be used directly to support the constitutionality of s 7(1)(e).
	


Whether s 7(1)(e) of the Act is constitutionally valid


	
	As no constitutional prohibition was said to apply, the question is whether s 7(1)(e) of the Act can be characterised as a law with respect to external affairs or defence or otherwise authorised by the incidental power. As the Commonwealth principally relied on the external affairs power, I shall address it first.
	


Characterisation: the relevant test


	
	Whether s 7(1)(e) can be characterised as a law with respect to external affairs requires a consideration of the practical effect and legal operation of the law (by reference to the rights, powers, liabilities, duties and privileges it creates) and a determination whether it reveals a sufficient connection with the subject matter of the head of power. If there is such a connection, the “justice and wisdom of the law, and the degree to which the means it adopts are necessary or desirable, are matters of legislative choice”: Grain Pool of WA v The Commonwealth [2000] HCA 14; 202 CLR 479 at [16]; Plaintiff S156/2013 v Minister for Immigration [2014] HCA 22; 88 ALJR 690 (Plaintiff S156) at [22] – [25].
	


The various aspects of the external affairs power


	
	The High Court, in determining the constitutionality of laws said to be authorised by the external affairs power, has addressed the extent of the power by reference to a number of aspects, the importance of any one of which depends on the character of the law sought to be impugned. These aspects necessarily overlap. The external affairs power has been taken to authorise laws:
	



	
	with respect to Australia’s relations with other nation States (external relations);
	
	
	with respect to places, persons, matters or things that lie outside the geographical limits of Australia (geographical externality);
	
	
	with respect to matters of international concern (international concern);
	
	
	that give effect to, or implement, recommendations of international agencies of high standing, including resolutions of the UN General Assembly and Security Council (international recommendations); and
	
	
	that give effect to Australia’s treaty obligations (treaty).
	



	
	These aspects do not have constitutional effect: they have been articulated to explain why certain laws fall within the external affairs power conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament by s 51(xxix). Nonetheless it was not suggested that any novel aspect of the power was required to be addressed in the present case.
	
	
	The Commonwealth relied on each of the aspects of the external affairs power set out above, with the exception of the treaty aspect, to support the constitutionality of s 7(1)(e). The plaintiff contended that the law, properly understood, fell within none of these aspects. The plaintiff further submitted that neither international concern, nor implementation of resolutions (except to the extent to which they are reasonably appropriate to implement a treaty) are aspects of the external affairs power.
	
	
	There was a further issue between the parties: the extent to which the principle of proportionality applied to each of the aspects of the external affairs power, with the exception of the treaty aspect in respect of which it was accepted that there was such a requirement. The plaintiff contended that questions of proportionality bear on the international concern, external relations and international recommendations aspect of the external affairs power. The plaintiff relied on a passage in Victoria v The Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 416 (Industrial Relations Act Case) at 487 (considered below). The plaintiff submitted that, because there was a requirement for proportionality in these aspects of the external affairs powers, the authorities regarding the requirement of proportionality in connection with the incidental power (such as Davis v The Commonwealth (1988) 166 CLR 79 at 99-100 and Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1) were applicable.
	
	
	The Commonwealth contended that there was no justification in the authorities for importing notions of proportionality into any but the treaty aspect of the external affairs power and that to do so would be inconsistent with the principles of characterisation articulated in Grain Pool of WA v The Commonwealth and reiterated in Plaintiff S156. Moreover, it did not accept that notions of proportionality were apposite to the incidental power and contended that Davis v The Commonwealth and Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills had been overtaken by Theophanous v Commonwealth [2006] HCA 18; 225 CLR 101 and Leask v The Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 579.
	
	
	Although the parties’ submissions dealt with each aspect in turn, I propose to address the relevant decisions of the High Court in chronological order in order to place the dicta in context before considering whether s 7(1)(e) of the Act falls within one or more aspects of the external affairs power.
	


The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry (1936)


	
	The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry (1936) 55 CLR 608 is an example of a law found to be valid within the treaty aspect of the external affairs power, although the external relations aspect was also considered to apply. Section 4 of the Air Navigation Act 1920 (Cth) was, by majority (Latham CJ, Evatt and McTiernan JJ), relevantly found to be valid because it conferred on the Governor-General the power to make regulations for the purposes of carrying out and giving effect to the convention for the regulation of aerial navigation signed in Paris on 13 October 1919. The regulations applied to all aircraft flying within Australian airspace, even those which were involved only in air travel that took place wholly within a single State of Australia. However, the particular regulations were found to be invalid since they did not conform to the strict terms of the treaty.
	
	
	In The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry, Latham CJ, at 643, expressly adopted external relations as an aspect of the external affairs power when his Honour observed that “[t]he regulation of relations between Australia and other countries . . . is the substantial subject matter of external affairs”.
	
	
	Justices Evatt and McTiernan (in a passage relied on by the Commonwealth for the proposition that the external affairs power also supports a law that implements recommendations of international agencies) said at 687:
	


“But it is not to be assumed that the legislative power over ‘external affairs’ is limited to the execution of treaties or conventions; and, to pursue the illustration previously referred to, the Parliament may well be deemed competent to legislate for the carrying out of ‘recommendations’ as well as the ‘draft international conventions’ resolved upon by the International Labour Organisation or of other international recommendations or requests upon other subject-matters of concern to Australia as a member of the family of nations. The power is a great and important one.”


	
	Justice Starke referred to the concept of proportionality in the context of the treaty aspect of the power and said at 659-660:
	


“The power is wide in terms, but its limits cannot be transcended. All means which are appropriate and are adopted to the enforcement of the convention and are not prohibited, or are not repugnant to or inconsistent with it, are within the power. The power must be construed liberally, and much must necessarily be left to the discretion of the contracting States in framing legislation, or otherwise giving effect to the convention.”


	
	It was not regarded as an impediment to a law being characterised as one with respect to external affairs that it governed the conduct of Australians within the Commonwealth. Justice Dixon said at 668:
	


“Although it [the external affairs power] may enable the Parliament to make laws operating outside the limits of the Commonwealth, it cannot be supposed that its primary purpose was to regulate conduct occurring abroad.”


	
	In a passage on which the Commonwealth placed particular reliance, Dixon J addressed the extent of the power to control conduct within Australia at 669:
	


“I think it is evident that its [the external affairs power’s] purpose was to authorise the Parliament to make laws governing the conduct of Australians in, and perhaps, out of the Commonwealth in reference to matters affecting the external relations of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth might under this power legislate to ensure that its citizens did nothing inside the Commonwealth preparatory to or in aid of some action outside the Commonwealth which might be considered a violation of international comity, as, for instance, a failure on the part of private persons to behave as subjects of a neutral power during a war between foreign countries.”

The King v Sharkey (1949)


	
	The King v Sharkey (1949) 79 CLR 121 (Sharkey) is an example of a law that was found to be valid within the external relations aspect of the external affairs power. Sharkey was charged on indictment with an offence under section 24D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) for uttering the following seditious words, which were published in the Daily Telegraph:
	


“If Soviet Forces in pursuit of aggressors entered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them. Australian workers would welcome Soviet Forces pursuing aggressors as the workers welcomed them throughout Europe when the Red troops liberated the people from the power of the Nazis. I support the statements made by the French Communist leader Maurice Thorez. Invasion of Australia by forces of the Soviet Union seems very remote and hypothetical to me. I believe the Soviet Union will go to war only if she is attacked and if she is attacked I cannot see Australia being invaded by Soviet troops. The job of Communists is to struggle to prevent war and to educate the mass of people against the idea of war. The Communist Party also wants to bring the working class to power but if fascists in Australia use force to prevent the workers gaining that power Communists will advise the workers to meet force with force.”


	
	The definition of “seditious intention” in s 24A included, in (c), “to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King’s Dominions”. Chief Justice Latham (with whom Webb J agreed), who found s24A(c) to be valid, said, at 137:
	


“The prevention and punishment of the excitement of disaffection within the Commonwealth against the Government or Constitution of any other Dominion may reasonably be thought by Parliament to constitute an element in the preservation of friendly relations with other Dominions.”


	
	I reject the plaintiff’s submission that these words ought be taken to indicate that Latham CJ (and Webb J) found the law valid only by reference to the external affairs power in conjunction with the incidental power (s 51(xxxix)) or that the words “may reasonably be thought” in the passage above were intended to import the requirement of reasonable proportionality into the core of the external affairs power. I consider that a fair reading of the reasons leads to the conclusion that the incidental power was only relevant to the definition of seditious intent in other contexts. Their Honours found that the definitions of the mental element of the offence of sedition in s 24A(1)(c) (intent to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King’s Dominions) and s 24A(1)(e) (to excite disaffection against the connexion of the King’s Dominions under the Crown) were authorised by the external affairs power.
	
	
	Justice McTiernan said at 157 that the expression “external affairs” was wider than “foreign affairs” because it extended to international relations, which “could be affected if seditious offences against the Government or Constitution of another Dominion were committed here with impunity”.
	
	
	Justices Rich and Williams concluded, without explanation, that the provisions were valid. The plaintiff submitted that the basis of a decision must be expressed before reliance could be placed on it and, accordingly, that Rich and Williams JJ ought not be regarded as agreeing with the approach taken by the other judges. However, in the context of the way the argument was put (in the summary at 133) – that the external affairs power extended “to sustaining a Government of another Dominion and its principal institutions” – their Honours’ finding that the law was valid is, in my view, to be understood as an acceptance of that submission, which accorded with the basis on which Latham CJ, Webb and McTiernan JJ found the law to be valid.
	
	
	Justice Dixon, who found parts of s 24A invalid, considered that it was beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth to protect an Australian State against “domestic violence” (in the sense of violence which manifested social unrest but which did not involve the defence of the realm). However, his Honour appears to have accepted (at 149) that s 24A(c) was valid under the external affairs power.
	
	
	In Sharkey, a majority of the High Court held that a prohibition directed to mere words which, though uttered and published wholly within Australia, had the potential to excite disaffection within the Commonwealth against another nation State was authorised by the external affairs power. The Court did not need to consider whether the law was proportional or reasonably adapted to any particular object.
	


The Seas and Submerged Lands Case (1975)


	
	In The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth of Australia (1975) 135 CLR 337 (the Seas and Submerged Lands Case), the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 (Cth), which vested sovereignty in the Commonwealth with respect to the continental shelf, the territorial sea and the airspace over it, was found to be valid under s 51(xxix). Although the High Court (Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Gibbs, Stephen, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ) was unanimous that the legislation concerning the continental shelf was valid under the external affairs power, there was a range of reasons for the ultimate conclusion. All judges, apart from Gibbs and Stephen JJ, held that the provisions were valid on the ground that they gave effect to the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. Justices Gibbs and Stephen, in dissent, did not consider the law to be valid in so far as it extended to the territorial sea and the airspace over it.
	
	
	Three judges, Barwick CJ, Mason and Jacobs JJ, considered the law to be valid in any event on the ground that the external affairs power extended to any matter or thing external to or situated outside Australia, and to persons outside Australia and their activities (the geographical externality aspect). This view of the external affairs power was based, at least in part, on the notion of sovereignty and the need for there to be “no gap in the constitutional framework” (per Jacobs J at 498). While the Australian States can exercise their sovereign legislative power subject to the principle of territoriality, no such limitation was found to apply to the Australian Government. Thus, according to Jacobs J at 498:
	


“Clearly the Crown in the Australian Executive Council and in the Australian Parliament has one bound which the British Parliament has not, for it cannot transgress the Constitution. But subject to that Constitution it in Council and in Parliament has that pre-eminence and excellence as a sovereign Crown which is possessed by the British Crown and Parliament. Exactly when it attained those qualities is a matter of the constitutional history of the British Commonwealth of Nations largely reflected in the Imperial conferences following the Great War. Legal recognition came through the Statute of Westminster 1931 and its later adoption by Australia. Now the Constitution is the only limitation. There is no gap in the constitutional framework. Every power, right and authority of the British Crown is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in Australia subject only to the Constitution. The State legislatures do not have that sovereignty which the British legislature and now the Australian legislature possess. A State can only legislate in respect of persons, acts, matters and things which have a relevant territorial connexion with the State, a connexion not too remote to entitle the law to the description of a law for the peace welfare and good government of the State: see Johnson v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1956] 1 All ER 502 ; [1956] AC 331 at 351–3, 355. The words of s 51 of the Constitution do not import any similar territorial limitation and there now is none in the case of the Australian legislature. The words “external affairs” can now be given an operation unaffected by any concept of territorial limitation. The result is that the Commonwealth, outside the boundaries of the States and subject to any particular constitutional injunctions, may make laws on all subject matters in exercise of its sovereignty.”


	
	Although Stephen J did not consider the law to be authorised by the external affairs power, his Honour accepted, at 450, that the external affairs power included “matters which are not consensual in nature, conduct on the part of a nation, or of its nationals, which affects other nations and its relations with them.” His Honour referred to passages from Sharkey to provide instances of such “non-consensual matters” that were included within Australia’s external affairs and therefore within the external affairs power.
	


Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982)


	
	In Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168 the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) was held, by majority (Stephen, Mason, Murphy and Brennan JJ) to be valid. The reasons of the judges who comprised the majority differed slightly as to the basis for the law being characterised as one with respect to external affairs.
	
	
	Justice Stephen (with reference to his judgment in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case referred to above) found the law to be valid on the basis that, because the subject matter was of international concern, it had the capacity to affect Australia’s relations with other States (the external relations aspect). His Honour considered that more was required than that the law enacted an obligation which Australia had assumed by treaty (the treaty aspect).
	
	
	Justices Mason and Murphy found that the external affairs power was broad enough to authorise the implementation of any obligation Australia had assumed by treaty. Justice Mason exposed the fallacy of the proposition that there is any relevant dichotomy between external affairs and internal affairs. His Honour cited The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry as an example of a valid law that was both external (because it carried a treaty into effect) and internal (because it operated substantially within Australia), as well as Sharkey where the law found to be valid exhibited the same duality (internal operation but potential external effect).
	
	
	Justice Brennan found, similarly, that if Australia undertook a treaty obligation with respect to an aspect of Australian internal legal order, the subject matter of the obligation became thereby (if not previously) an external affair. Accordingly, a law with respect to that subject matter was a law with respect to external affairs. His Honour also referred to Sharkey (at 257) as illustrating that a matter of internal concern can become an external affair and said:
	


“A law defining a crime was supported because such a crime, though locally committed, had the potential to affect Australia’s external relations.”


	
	Chief Justice Gibbs, in dissent, did not accept that the law was authorised by the external affairs power. However, his Honour cited Sharkey as demonstrating that the external affairs power was not limited to matters external to Australia and could be used to enact a law which regulated “conduct within Australia by Australians”. At 191 his Honour referred to The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry and Sharkey as examples of laws where “the law, although operating within Australia, was one with respect to a subject-matter which involved a relationship with other countries”. His Honour’s reasons do not provide any support for the proposition that Sharkey ought be read as requiring that the external affairs power be qualified by reference to notions of purpose or proportionality.
	


The Tasmanian Dam Case (1983)


	
	The Commonwealth v The State of Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1 (the Tasmanian Dam case) provides another instance of a law found to be valid by reference to the treaty aspect of the external affairs power. In that case the legislation under challenge gave effect to the World Heritage Convention. In December 1982, at the request of the Australian Government, an area of national parks in south-western Tasmania was accepted by the World Heritage Committee for entry in the World Heritage List, which identified the Franklin River system in Tasmania as of particular international concern. Regulations made under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (Cth) prohibited construction of a dam in the specified area. The Commonwealth legislation was found to be valid under the external affairs power in so far as it enabled regulations to be made for giving effect to the Convention.
	
	
	Justice Deane (in a passage relied on by the Commonwealth as supporting the proposition that the implementation of recommendations of international agencies falls within the external affairs power) expressly approved the dicta of Evatt and McTiernan JJ in The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry set out above and said at 258 – 259:
	


“It is, however, relevant for present purposes to note that the responsible conduct of external affairs in today's world will, on occasion, require observance of the spirit as well as the letter of international agreements, compliance with recommendations of international agencies and pursuit of international objectives which cannot be measured in terms of binding obligation.”

Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth (1991)


	
	In Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501 a challenge was made to s 9 of the War Crimes Act 1945 (Cth) which provided that a person who, on or after 1 September 1939 and on or before 8 May 1945, committed a “war crime” was guilty of an indictable offence. An information was laid against Polyukhovich which alleged that between 1 September 1942 and 31 May 1943 he had committed war crimes in the Ukraine, which was then under German occupation. At the time of the commission of the alleged offences there was no Australian legislation in force that purported to make it a criminal offence for an Australian citizen or resident to do such acts in the Ukraine as the plaintiff was alleged to have done.
	
	
	By majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, Brennan J dissenting), the High Court held s 9 to be valid under the external affairs power in so far as it operated upon conduct which took place outside Australia and made that conduct a criminal offence. Accordingly, the law was found to be valid as falling within the geographical externality aspect of the external affairs power.
	
	
	Chief Justice Mason reiterated the view his Honour had expressed in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case and said, at 528, that the scope of the external affairs power was not confined to Australia’s relations with other States or the implementation of its treaty obligations; that it ought be construed with “all the generality that the words admit”; and ought be regarded as extending to matters and things as well as relationships outside Australia. His Honour specifically expressed agreement with the passage from the reasons of Jacobs J in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case set out above. Accordingly, Mason CJ did not consider it necessary to consider whether the law either gave effect to an obligation under international law; implemented a resolution of an international body; or facilitated the exercise of international jurisdiction under international law.
	
	
	Justice Deane took a similarly broad view of the external affairs power, and on the same basis. His Honour said at 599:
	


“The first thing to be stressed about s51(xxix) of the Constitution for the purposes of the present case is that its reference to ‘External affairs’ is unqualified. The paragraph does not refer to ‘Australia's external affairs’. Nor does it limit the subject matter of the grant of power to external affairs which have some special connexion with Australia. The word ‘external’ means ‘outside’. As a matter of language, it carries no implication beyond that of location. The word ‘affairs’ has a wide and indefinite meaning. It is appropriate to refer to relations, matters or things. Used without qualification or limitation, the phrase ‘external affairs’ is appropriate, in a constitutional grant of legislative power, to encompass both relationships and things: relationships with or between foreign States and foreign or international organizations or other entities; matters and things which are territorially external to Australia regardless of whether they have some identified connexion with Australia or whether they be the subject matter of international treaties, dealings, rights or obligations.”


	
	Justice Deane referred to the need for the external affairs power to be construed broadly by reason of Australia’s status as a “fully independent sovereign State” (at 602). His Honour warned against the creation of a legislative lacuna (at 603), which would result from a narrow interpretation of the external affairs power.
	
	
	Justice Dawson expressed agreement with the wide interpretation of the external affairs power as extending to all places, persons, matters or things geographically external to Australia (at 636 - 637). His Honour endorsed the approach to sovereignty taken by Mason CJ and Deane J and said at 638:
	


“For although the sovereignty of the Australian nation is divided internally between the Commonwealth and the States, there is no division with respect to matters which lie outside Australia. There the sovereignty of the nation is the sovereignty of the Commonwealth . . . Indeed, any limitation upon the power of the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to matters outside the country would leave a gap in the totality of legislative power which the Constitution bestows upon the Commonwealth and the States. An interpretation of the Constitution which denies the completeness of Australian legislative power is unacceptable in terms of constitutional theory and practice. Apart from express or implied constitutional prohibitions or limitations, it is not to be contemplated that there are laws which no Parliament has the power to pass: [citations omitted.]”


	
	Justice Gaudron’s reasons were to like effect (see especially 695-696), as were those of McHugh J (at 712 – 717).
	
	
	In addition I note what McHugh J said at 716 – 717, which is of particular relevance to the present case:
	


“In my opinion, the external affairs power extends to conduct engaged in in Australia for the purpose of carrying out some object external to Australia. Thus, a law which prohibits persons from doing any act or thing in Australia with intent to overthrow by force or violence a foreign government is a law with respect to external affairs: cf. s24AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Similarly, the external affairs power would support a law which prohibits persons from preparing in Australia for an incursion into a foreign State for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities: cf. s7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth). Although the acts which ss 6(1), 7 and 9(1) of the Act penalize were acts occurring within Australia, they were acts which were committed in the course of or for the purpose of events occurring outside Australia. Consequently, ss 6(1), 7 and 9(1), which punish such acts, were validly enacted under the external affairs power.”


	
	The plaintiff accepted that if I followed this dictum, I would dismiss the motion to quash the indictment as well as the summons.
	
	
	Although Brennan J dissented and held that the external affairs power did not support the law, his Honour referred to the reasons of Stephen J in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen which explained why matters of international concern fell within the external affairs power. Nonetheless, his Honour considered that the expression “international concern” ought not be interpreted broadly and said, at 561, that there may be few occasions when the external affairs power is enlivened on the basis of an “international concern” without a corresponding obligation in international law.
	
	
	In summary, Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth established a broad interpretation of the geographical externality aspect of the external affairs power, in that a majority of judges held that it ought be construed to authorise laws with respect to matters external to Australia.
	


The Industrial Relations Act Case (1996)


	
	In the Industrial Relations Act Case the High Court considered a challenge to the validity of a law which affected a domestic subject matter, industrial law. The Commonwealth argued that its legislative power derived from obligations it had undertaken by treaty. Although the concept of proportionality was raised, it was not regarded as being particularly helpful in the context of a decision whether a law ought be characterised as being one with respect to external affairs (487-488).
	
	
	The majority also expressly agreed with what Dawson J said in Richardson v Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 326. Justice Dawson there explained that the external affairs power is not a purposive power and that the implementation of treaties falls within the power because it is a subject matter covered by “external affairs”. His Honour continued:
	


“And the purpose of legislation which purports to implement a treaty is considered not to see whether it answers a requirement of purpose to be found in the head of power itself, but to see whether the legislation operates in fulfilment of the treaty and thus upon a subject which is an aspect of external affairs.”


	
	The plaintiff in the present case placed particular reliance on the following passage from the reasons of the majority at 487 (which immediately followed the extract from Richardson v Forestry Commission) in support of his proposition that the proportionality principle applied to the external relations and international concern aspects, as well as to the treaty aspect of the external affairs power:
	


“In this context, purpose is not something found in the head of power. Rather, it is a test for determining whether the law in question is reasonably capable of being considered as giving effect to the treaty and therefore as being a law upon a subject which is an aspect of external affairs.”


	
	I note for completeness that in Attorney-General for the State of South Australia v Adelaide City Corporation [2013] HCA 3; 249 CLR 1 at [56], French CJ referred to this test as being “a high threshold test”.
	
	
	The majority also considered that a law can be a valid exercise of the external affairs power, even if it only partially implements treaty obligations, and said at 489:
	


“Deficiency in implementation of a supporting Convention is not necessarily fatal to the validity of a law; but a law will be held invalid if the deficiency is so substantial as to deny the law the character of a measure implementing the Convention or it is a deficiency which, when coupled with other provisions of the law, make it substantially inconsistent with the Convention.”


	
	The majority, at 483, expressly approved the dicta of Evatt and McTiernan JJ in The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry at 687, which is set out above, in which their Honours considered that the carrying out of recommendations of international agencies “may well” fall within the external affairs power.
	


XYZ v The Commonwealth (2006)


	
	In XYZ v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25; 227 CLR 532 a challenge was made to provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which prohibited a person, while outside Australia, from engaging in sexual intercourse (s 50BA), or committing an act of indecency (s 50BC), with a person under the age of sixteen. Section 50AD applied only to persons who were, at the time of the offence, Australian citizens or residents. It is another example of a law that was found to be valid on the basis of the geographical externality aspect of the external affairs power, although it was also found to be a matter of international concern that might affect Australia’s relations with other States.
	
	
	The High Court, by majority, held the provisions to be valid under the external affairs power. Chief Justice Gleeson, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ expressly followed Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth and held that, as the external affairs power supported a law with respect to places, matters or things outside the geographical limits of Australia, the provisions were valid on that basis. At [18], Gleeson CJ described this aspect of the external affairs power as the one “that allows the Australian body politic to exercise the plenitude of power which flows from nationhood and independence.”
	
	
	Justice Kirby (at [124]) considered that so many matters had become “of international concern” that it was not a useful concept because of its potential to destroy federal arrangements. His Honour based his decision that the law was within power on the narrower basis (established by the constitutional fact material) that the subject matter of the provisions was relevant to Australia’s external relations with other States through their collective participation in the international organisations concerned, as appears from his Honour’s conclusion at [138]:
	


“The participation of many nation states in the activities of such international organisations reinforces the conclusion already reached that the subject of the law is one with respect to the relations of the Commonwealth with nation states other than Australia and thus within s 51(xxix) of the Constitution.”


	
	Justice Kirby also treated an argument put by XYZ as concerning proportionality, although it was not put in those terms (see [140] – [147]). Although his Honour’s reasons could be read as supporting a requirement of proportionality with respect to the external relations aspect of the external affairs power, I do not regard this as the appropriate reading. It would, in any event, be at odds with the weight of authority which is, for the reasons addressed elsewhere, that there is no such requirement with respect to the external relations aspect of the external affairs power.
	
	
	The minority view of Callinan and Heydon JJ was that what their Honours referred to as the “geographic externality view”, reflected in the judgments of Jacobs and Mason JJ in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case, which were followed and accepted by the majority in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth, ought be rejected. Justices Callinan and Heydon considered that Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth should be overruled to the extent to which the geographic externality view was a necessary step in its reasoning.
	
	
	Their Honours also expressed substantial reservations about the utility of “external relations” and “international concern” in the determination of validity under the external affairs power. As to “external relations”, Callinan and Heydon JJ at [209] regarded it as questionable whether statements by the executive, that the sexual abuse of children by Australian men in Asia both brought Australia into disrepute and affected our external relations, could establish a “factual condition precedent to a constitutional power to legislate”. As to “international concern”, their Honours said at [218]:
	


“This volatility, and the elusiveness connected with attempts to define ‘international concern’, strongly suggest that the international concern doctrine does not exist; for if it did, it would operate antithetically to the rule of law.”


	
	Justice Heydon reiterated his reservations about these aspects of the external affairs power in Pape v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] HCA 23; 238 CLR 1 at [469] – [474].
	


Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth (2006)


	
	Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 40; 227 CLR 614 concerned the validity of certain provisions of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth). The relevance of the case for present purposes is that the law was found to be a law with respect to external affairs, notwithstanding the absence of a relevant extradition treaty, on the basis that extradition was found to be a matter that concerned Australia’s relations with other States. Chief Justice Gleeson said at [36]:
	


“The external affairs power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. Making arrangements, by treaty or otherwise, for the extradition of alleged fugitive offenders, and giving effect to those arrangements, are matters that directly concern Australia’s relations with other countries and are part of that aspect of its external affairs.”

Thomas v Mowbray (2007)


	
	The ambit of the external affairs power was also considered by Gleeson CJ and Gummow and Crennan JJ in Thomas v Mowbray in the context of a challenge to the validity of s 104.4 of the Criminal Code which empowered judicial officers (including Federal magistrates) to impose control orders, including interim control orders, for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act. The expression “terrorist act” was relevantly defined to include an action or threat of action with the intention of “advancing a political, religious or ideological cause” and an intention either of “coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country” or part thereof; or “intimidating the public or a section of the public” which includes a reference to the public of a country other than Australia. The court’s power to make an interim control order required that the court be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that:
	



	
	making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act, or that the person has provided training to, or received training from, a listed terrorist organisation; and
	
	
	each of the obligations, prohibitions and restrictions to be imposed by the order is reasonably necessary, and reasonably appropriate and adapted, for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act.
	



	
	Chief Justice Gleeson held that the existence of these two criteria meant that the law was supported by the defence power supplemented, where necessary, by the external affairs power. Justices Gummow and Crennan said at [151]:
	


“The pursuit and advancement of comity with foreign governments and the preservation of the integrity of foreign states may be a subject matter of a law with respect to external affairs. In XYZ v Commonwealth, Gleeson CJ noted (with evident approval) that it was accepted that the external affairs power at least includes power to make laws in respect to matters affecting Australia's relations with other countries. The commission of ""terrorist acts"" in the sense defined in s 100.1 of the Code is now, even if it has not been in the past, one of these matters.”


	
	The conclusion that the law was within the external affairs power was arrived at notwithstanding that the conduct that was affected by the control order was, largely, if not wholly, conduct within Australia. At [152], their Honours cited with approval Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [2002] 1 SCR 3 at 50 where the Supreme Court of Canada described terrorism as a “worldwide phenomenon” in respect of which “preventative or precautionary state action may be justified”.
	
	
	Justices Gummow and Crennan concluded that the law was authorised by the external affairs power and said at [153], after referring to the passage from the Industrial Relations Act Case which expressly adopted the geographical externality aspect of the power:
	


“The legislative scheme in Div 104 of the Code for prevention through the interim control order system of ‘terrorist acts’ done or threatened with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the government of a foreign country or part thereof or intimidating the public or a section of the public of a foreign country is a law with respect to a ‘matter or thing’ which lies outside the geographical limits of Australia. The ‘matter or thing’ is the apprehended intimidation or injury to the government or public of a foreign country.”


	
	I do not accept the plaintiff’s contention (which, in my view, involved a degree of sophistry) that this statement in Thomas v Mowbray ought be regarded as referring to the incidental power rather than the external affairs power. In my view a fair reading of the reasons of Gummow and Crennan JJ indicates that their Honours were there addressing the ambit of the external affairs power without regard to the incidental power.
	
	
	The plaintiff accepted that if the dicta of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Crennan JJ were followed, the motion and summons would be dismissed.
	
	
	The other members of the majority (Callinan and Heydon JJ) did not need to address the external affairs power as they considered the legislation to be valid under the defence power.
	


Plaintiff S156 (2014)


	
	In Plaintiff S156, the High Court found provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) valid under the aliens power. Although Plaintiff S156 did not concern the external affairs power, I propose to address it because both parties relied on what was said about the relationship between core powers and the incidental powers and the relevance of proportionality.
	
	
	The plaintiff in Plaintiff S156 argued that, for a law to be supported under the aliens power, it must satisfy a test of proportionality as an integral part of the test of connection (for the purposes of characterisation) and that the sections were not proportional because they went further than merely regulating the entry of aliens to, or their removal from, Australia.
	
	
	The High Court rejected the proportionality argument in the context of a non-purposive power and said that, while proportionality might be relevant to express or implied limitations that restricted a head of power, it did not apply in the context of the aliens power. The Court referred to Leask v The Commonwealth at 593 – 595 in which Brennan CJ considered proportionality in the context of how the prohibition in s 92 of the Constitution restricted the power of an Australian State to enact a law which imposed a burden on interstate trade and commerce. I do not regard Plaintiff S156 as providing any support for the proposition that proportionality applies to any aspect of the external affairs power, beyond the treaty aspect.
	


The validity of s 6(1)(a) under the external affairs power


	
	The plaintiff argued that s 6(1)(a) of the Act was largely an offence of intention, since it could be committed merely by entry into a foreign State with the intention of engaging in armed hostilities there, irrespective of whether that intention was ever acted upon. Thus he submitted that the conduct proscribed by s 6(1)(a) was anterior or preparatory in character. The plaintiff also contended that, because of the effect of s 11.6(2) of the Criminal Code, an offence against s 6 included attempt, incitement or conspiracy to commit the principal offence.
	
	
	The plaintiff nonetheless accepted that s 6(1)(a) of the Act was a law with respect to external affairs on the basis that the requisite externality was provided by the requirement that the Crown prove, as an element of the offence, entry into the foreign State. He also accepted that Parliament can use the external affairs power to enact prophylactic provisions (such as those found to be valid in Thomas v Mowbray) to prevent undesired conduct.
	


Characterisation of s 7(1)(e)

The practical and legal operation of s 7(1)(e)


	
	Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s acceptance of the validity of s 6(1)(a), he contended that s 7(1)(e) could not be characterised as a law with respect to external affairs, at least in so far as it purported to proscribe the performance of services in Australia with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against s 6(1)(a) read with s 6(3)(aa).
	
	
	As referred to above, whether s 7(1)(e) can be characterised as a law with respect to external affairs requires a consideration of the practical effect and legal operation of the law: Grain Pool of WA v The Commonwealth.
	
	
	The plaintiff placed considerable emphasis, both on what the Crown is required to prove to establish an offence under s 7(1)(e) based on s 6(1)(a) read with s 6(3)(aa), and what is not required to be proved.
	
	
	For present purposes, s 7(1)(e) criminalises the giving of money or the performance of services by Australian nationals or residents to other persons with the intention of supporting an incursion into a foreign State with the intention of engaging in hostile activities there. In order to prove the commission of an offence against s 7(1)(e), the Crown must establish:
	



	
	That, at the time the services were allegedly performed, the accused was either in Australia (or had been before the performance of the services for a purpose connected with such performance), or was an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia; and
	
	
	That the accused, relevantly, performed services for another person with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against s 6 (which includes, for reasons given above, attempt, incitement and conspiracy to commit the principal offence under s 6).
	



	
	There was an issue as to the intention that was required to be proved as the fault element of the offence. The plaintiff contended that there were two mental elements required: the intention to give money or perform services; and the intention to support or promote an offence against s 6. The Commonwealth contended that there is only one intention required to be proved: namely that of “supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against s 6”. The precise directions to be given to a jury in the trial of an accused charged with an offence against s 7(1)(e) are a matter for another day. Whether the intention is regarded as single, dual or multiple, proof of an offence under s 7(1)(e) requires proof of criteria which link the act of giving money or performing services with a foreign incursion for the purposes of engaging in hostile activities there.
	
	
	In my view, the fault element required is the single, albeit compound, intention required by s 7(1)(e). I note that this accords with the view expressed by Lasry J (with reference to a charge under s 7(1)(a) of the Act) in R v Mohamed (Ruling No. 1) [2015] VSC 290R. Despite the length of the debate in oral and in writing, I understood the plaintiff’s ultimate submission to be that the characterisation of the law was neither determined, nor substantially affected, by the resolution of this question.
	
	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the following matters cannot provide the requisite “external” element to support the validity of s 7(1)(e) since the Crown need not establish any of these matters to prove that a putative offender has committed an offence under s 7(1)(e):
	



	
	That any person for whom the accused performed services, or who benefited from the accused’s performance of services, actually entered a foreign State with intent to engage in a hostile activity;
	
	
	That the persons for whom the accused is alleged to have performed services themselves intended to enter into the foreign State;
	
	
	That any physical event outside Australia actually occurred as a result of the alleged performance of services;
	
	
	That the intended hostile activities in support of which the services were performed would be likely to have any particular consequences such as, for example, to advance either the interests of a foreign government, Australia’s foreign relations or the defence of the Commonwealth;
	
	
	That entry into the foreign State was imminent or likely or that the putative offender’s intention was likely to result in an entry into a foreign State for the specified purpose;
	
	
	That the putative offender knew the essential elements of the hostile activities said to be intended in the foreign State;
	
	
	That the persons to whom the putative offender is alleged to have performed services were themselves Australian citizens or residents (and therefore irrespective of whether those persons could be found guilty of an offence under s 6(1)(a), having regard to s 6(2)); or
	
	
	That any of the requirements for derivative offences such as attempt, conspiracy or incitement were met.
	


Whether there is a requirement of proportionality


	
	Proportionality, in the present context, gives rise to the question whether the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to the particular end or purpose. As referred to above, whether proportionality is relevant to characterisation in the context of the external affairs power was a substantial issue between the parties. Accordingly, I propose to address it before turning to the submissions on the various aspects of the external affairs power.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s submissions to the contrary, I do not discern any support in the authorities to which reference has been made above that any aspect of the external affairs power, other than the treaty aspect, are to be qualified by the principle of proportionality. Although proportionality is regarded as relevant to a purposive power, such as defence, it is not relevant to powers with respect to subject matters such as external affairs and aliens. The following extract from the reasons of Dawson J in Leask v The Commonwealth at 602 - 603 summarises the law:
	


“To introduce the concept of proportionality, whether it be via the notion that a law must be reasonably appropriate and adapted to some end in view or by any other route, is to introduce a concept which is alien to the principles which this court has hitherto applied in determining the validity of laws passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.

. . . the test remains one of sufficient connection. If that connection is established, it matters not how ill-adapted, inappropriate or disproportionate a law is or may be thought to be.”


	
	Unlike the environmental legislation considered in the Tasmanian Dams Case or the industrial legislation considered in the Industrial Relations Act Case, s 7(1)(e) is not concerned with a matter which has an “external” element solely because the Commonwealth has entered into a treaty in respect of it. Accordingly, “proportionality”, which has limited application in the context addressed in the passage cited above from the Industrial Relations Act Case, is of no relevance for present purposes, except to the extent to which the Commonwealth relied on implementation of recommendations of international agencies as an aspect of the external affairs power (the treaty aspect not being engaged in the present case). I do not accept the plaintiff’s reading of the reasons of the majority at 487 of the Industrial Relations Case.
	
	
	It follows from this conclusion that several of the arguments made by the plaintiff must be rejected since they depended on the relevance of proportionality.
	
	
	First, it is not necessary that I be persuaded that s 7(1)(e) is in fact appropriate and adapted to a particular purpose or object, since it is for Parliament and not the courts, to judge the means by which it proscribes the engagement in armed hostilities in foreign States, and the preparatory steps thereto. That Parliament has chosen a means of criminalising conduct which does not rest on orthodox notions of accessorial liability such as aiding and abetting, or conspiring in the commission of, the principal offence, is not to the point (and would not be determinative even if proportionality were relevant: see Tajjour v New South Wales [2014] HCA 35; 88 ALJR 860 at [81] per Hayne J).
	
	
	Secondly, the plaintiff’s argument that, in so far as Parliament’s concern is recruitment, it has addressed that topic in ss 8 and 9 also falls away. Any lack of correspondence between the conditions for making a declaration under s 9(2) and those relating to the elements of an offence under s 6 becomes irrelevant when it is appreciated that proportionality does not apply.
	
	
	Thirdly, the plaintiff’s contention that there is no “need” to give the Commonwealth power to regulate conduct within the territory of Australia because the Australian States have plenary power to do so, would only have relevance if the principle of proportionality applied. The reserved powers doctrine (according to which the ambit of the legislative power of Australian States was relevant to whether a Commonwealth law could be characterised as one with respect to one of the enumerated heads of Commonwealth power), which was rejected almost a century ago in Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920) 28 CLR 129 (Engineers Case), made the extent of the power of the Australian States otherwise irrelevant to the question whether a law could be characterised as being one with respect to a head of Commonwealth power.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the four aspects of the external affairs power on which the Commonwealth relies to support the characterisation of s 7(1)(e) as a law with respect to external affairs: external relations; geographical externality; international concern; and recommendations of international agencies.
	


Whether s 7(1)(e) is authorised by the external relations aspect of the external affairs power


	
	The authorities referred to above establish that a law that regulates conduct that takes place wholly within Australia can become an external affair if it has the potential to affect Australia’s external relations: The King v Sharkey and Thomas v Mowbray. For the reasons given, neither the assessment of purpose nor the requirement of proportionality has any role in the task of characterising a law as being one with respect to external affairs on the basis of the external relations aspect. A matter that concerns Australia’s relations with other States is also within this aspect of the power even if it concerns a matter that could have been, but was not, the subject of a treaty (such as extradition, as in Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth).
	
	
	The authorities considered above provide no basis for limiting the external relations aspect of the external affairs power to those hostile activities which might have the effect of damaging Australia’s relationship with the foreign State in respect of which the incursion is contemplated. The selection of friends or foes among the nation States of the world (or the classification of one for one purpose and another for a different purpose) is not a matter for the courts. The power is one with respect to “external affairs” and not one with respect to “the advancement of Australia’s relations with particular foreign States”.
	
	
	I reject the plaintiff’s submission that, before I could characterise s 7(1)(e) of the Act as being a law with respect to the external relations aspect of the external affairs power, I would need to be satisfied by evidence that the law would have an actual effect on external relations. This is not what Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v The State of New South Wales [No. 2] (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 165 requires. The passage relied upon referred to the dicta of Williams J in Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth at 222 in the context of the defence power, in respect of which different considerations apply because it is a purposive power which expands and contracts by reference to external circumstances in respect of which constitutional fact evidence is generally required. There is no support in the authorities for the proposition for which the plaintiff contended that constitutional validity under the external affairs power depends on “discernible advancement” of Australia’s relations with other States: see Zines, The High Court and the Constitution (5th ed 2008, The Federation Press) at 399. The difficulties likely to be associated with a court’s making such an assessment is a further (but not the principal) reason for not importing such a qualification into the external affairs power.
	
	
	I regard the tolerance or acquiescence by a State of actions on its territory for the purpose of supporting foreign incursions, as being inimical to its relationship with other States generally, in the same way as tolerance or acquiescence of the publication of seditious words that tend to incite violence and disaffection against foreign States was found to be in Sharkey. The prohibition (and criminalisation) of such actions under the domestic law (or the failure to do so) has the potential to affect Australia’s external relations. By criminalising preparatory acts, s 7(1)(e) is, on its face, intended, and designed, to support the principle of the sovereignty and equality of States as well as the principle of non-intervention. These matters concern Australia’s role as a member of the “family of nations” and thus provide a sufficient connection to the external relations aspect of the external affairs power, without the need to have regard to the constitutional fact evidence.
	
	
	The potential of a law such as s 7(1)(e) to affect Australia’s external relations is, however, further demonstrated by the constitutional fact evidence, the effect of which is considered below.
	


The effect of the constitutional fact evidence


	
	The constitutional fact evidence established that the duties of States, not to acquiesce in conduct by persons within their own territories that was designed to lead to armed hostilities in other States, was a subject of several UN resolutions prior to the date of royal assent of the Act. The resolutions imposed obligations on States not only with respect to specific conflicts but also, in the case of the Friendly Relations Declaration, generally. Although some of the resolutions referred exclusively to mercenaries, the Friendly Relations Declaration did not distinguish between mercenaries (the convention definition of which would neither include the plaintiff nor the persons for whom he is alleged to have performed services), on the one hand, and the broader genus of foreign fighters (motivated by religion, culture, ideology or some other reason), on the other. The terms of the declaration and its purpose are inconsistent with any such distinction.
	
	
	Because the matters addressed in the Friendly Relations Declaration were expressed to derive from such fundamental tenets of customary international law as the equality of States and the principle of non-intervention, I regard the prohibition on a State tolerating “subversive, terrorist or armed activities” which “interfere in civil strife in another State” as being a matter not just of international concern (as to which see further below), but also one that affects one State’s (and relevantly, Australia’s) external relations with other States generally, irrespective of military, political or cultural alliances between particular States.
	
	
	The material relied upon, including the Friendly Relations Declaration and Oppenheim’s commentary, establishes that States are under a duty, in order to comply with UN resolutions, to take steps to criminalise the activities of those within their territory who seek to assist foreign fighters to engage in hostile activities within the territories of foreign States. The Act, including s 7(1)(e), is intended to deter and prevent such activities.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought to distinguish Sharkey on the ground that the definition of seditious intent in s 24A(c) of the Crimes Act pertained to conduct which might affect a foreign Government (and therefore Australia’s relationship with same). The plaintiff submitted that, while Sharkey might support the constitutionality of s 7(1)(e) in so far as it relied on s 6(1)(a) and s 6(3)(a), (c) and (d), it did not support an offence based on s 6(3)(aa). The plaintiff contended that, because an offence based on the definition of s 6(3)(aa) did not require any particular objective at all beyond engaging in hostile activities in the foreign State, it could not be concluded that the conduct would be significant to the interests of the foreign government or, indeed, have any effect whatsoever on external relations.
	
	
	I accept that there is a distinction between s 6(3)(aa) on the one hand, and s 6(3)(a), (c) and (d) on the other, in that s6(3)(aa) criminalises conduct irrespective of whether it has any discernible effect on the government of the foreign State, whereas s 6(3)(a), (c) and (d) are expressed to criminalise conduct on the basis of such an effect. Section 6(3)(b) is in a different category (which may overlap with s 6(3)(aa)) in that it criminalises conduct which has the objective of causing by force or violence the public of the foreign State to be in fear of death or injury.
	
	
	I am not, however, persuaded of the materiality of the distinction for present purposes. Although matters directly affecting the government of a foreign State can be seen to fall squarely within the external relations aspect of the external affairs power, it does not follow that matters which do not necessarily directly affect the government of a foreign State do not.
	
	
	In my view, matters such as: whether the foreign State is friend or foe of the State whose citizens or residents are supporting such forays; and whether the hostilities in the foreign State directly involve the government of such State or are confined to hostilities between non-governmental groups, are immaterial to the vice which the imposition of such obligations is designed to address: foreign support of armed hostilities within a State outside the auspices of the UN or agreement between the governments of the respective States. This is a matter which I regard as engaging the external relations aspect of the external affairs power since it has the potential to affect Australia’s external relations. For this reason, there is no basis to distinguish the criminalisation of actions intended to be preparatory to entry into a foreign State for the purposes of engaging in hostile activities (s 7(1)(e), coupled with s 6(3)(aa)), from the criminalisation of words intended to incite disaffection with the governments of foreign States which was found to be within power in Sharkey.
	
	
	Even if the test as formulated by the plaintiff – that the law “discernibly pursues the conduct of foreign relations” – were (contrary to my view of the authorities) the correct test, I am persuaded that s 7(1)(e) satisfies it for the reasons given above.
	
	
	The High Court in Sharkey held that s 24A(c), coupled with s 24D, of the Crimes Act was a valid exercise of the external affairs power although it applied to acts that occurred wholly within Australia and criminalised acts which, if not deterred or prohibited, had the potential to affect Australia’s external relations. In my view, the decision in Sharkey requires the conclusion that s 7(1)(e) is a valid exercise of the external affairs power.
	


Whether s 7(1)(e) is authorised by the geographical externality aspect of the external affairs power


	
	An element of the offence is that the person giving the money or performing the services must intend thereby to support entry into a foreign State which is, in turn, intended to involve hostile activities on the part of the recipient of the goods or services or an associate of the recipient. The “external affair”, or matter outside Australia, is the entry on the territory of the foreign State in respect of which activity with the proscribed intention is contemplated.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s submissions on this aspect of the external affairs power were twofold.
	
	
	First, the plaintiff contended that an offence against s 7(1)(e), particularly when coupled with s 6(3)(aa), is “largely an offence of intention”. He argued that since a person’s state of mind is “imperceptible, intangible and (in many cases) unknowable”, the validity of the law cannot depend on intention because that would involve an unacceptably uncertain criterion of power.
	
	
	Secondly, the plaintiff contended that the only aspect of s 7(1)(e) of the Act that was “external” was the putative offender’s state of mind, which was insufficient to make it a law with respect to external affairs. He argued that the requirement for an external place, matter or thing outside the geographical limits of Australia was satisfied only by tangibles and could therefore not be satisfied by intention. He submitted that an offence against s 7(1)(e) had no greater externality than would an offence of jaywalking while daydreaming of overseas holidays.
	
	
	The first submission disregards a fundamental principle of criminal law. Generally, a person’s state of mind needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before an accused can be found guilty of an offence. The maxim actus no facit reum nisi mens sit rea (the deed does not make a man guilty unless his mind be guilty) is well established and forms the basis for the presumption that mens rea (mental element) is an essential ingredient of every offence: Sweet v Parsley [1970] AC 132 at 149 per Reid LJ. In addressing the proof of intent, Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, vol. 2 (1979) said at [242]:
	


“General principle. The state of mind which accompanies an act is often of legal consequence as forming an ingredient necessary for the attachment of certain consequences.

(1)   Criminal intent. The state of mind accompanying a forbidden act is frequently an element material to make the act a crime.”


	
	A person’s state of mind is generally assessed by reference both to the person’s acts and statements, including admissions and communications with third parties. The present case is no exception in circumstances where the Crown case includes tape recordings and transcriptions of what passed between the plaintiff and others in intercepted communications.
	
	
	As to the second submission, I can discern no basis in the authorities for limiting the geographical externality aspect of the external affairs power to tangibles. Indeed, I regard this submission as foreclosed by the dicta of Gummow and Crennan JJ in Thomas v Mowbray at [153] that the relevant external “matter or thing” was “apprehended intimidation or injury to the government or public of a foreign country”.
	
	
	An offence against s 7(1)(e) is committed if the act of performing the services is done with the objective of supporting an offence against s 6. Thus, although the act might be done wholly within Australia, the associated mental element has an external purpose. The connection with the external purpose is, in my view, neither “remote”, nor “fortuitous”, nor “insubstantial”. By contrast, any connection, in the postulated example, between the act of jaywalking and the exotic reveries of the putative offender at the time could only be regarded as fortuitous.
	
	
	Nor is it an answer to say that, where the external component on which the law depends for its validity is intention, and the person with the relevant intention is located in Australia, the law cannot be a law with respect to external affairs. Such a proposition is inconsistent with The King v Sharkey. As long as the mental element of the offence, as here, requires a connection with an external matter (providing services with the intention of supporting entry into a foreign State with the intention of engaging in hostile activity there), it does not matter that the putative offender is, at all material times, in Australia or that the services were performed wholly in Australia. Nor does what the plaintiff described as the lack of “real world effect” deprive the prophylactic measures incorporated in s 7(1)(e) of their character as a law with respect to external affairs.
	
	
	In my view, s 7(1)(e) of the Act is a law with respect to external affairs, in the sense in which that term has been authoritatively understood: namely, to extend to a matter outside Australia. Neither this analysis nor this conclusion requires regard to be had to the constitutional fact evidence.
	


Whether s 7(1)(e) is authorised by the international concern aspect of the external affairs power


	
	I reject the plaintiff’s contention that matters of international concern are not (or no longer) an aspect of the external affairs power. The dicta set out above (including the statements of Stephen J in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen at 217, which were approved by Brennan J in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth at 561) support the continued relevance of matters of international concern to validity under the external affairs power. The reservations expressed by three members of the court in XYZ v The Commonwealth (Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ) about “international concern” as a basis for validity of a law under the external affairs power neither indicate a concluded view, nor amount to a decision to overrule earlier dicta.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, the constitutional fact evidence (including the Friendly Relations Declaration) established that the use of foreign fighters (including, but not limited to, mercenaries) in internal State conflicts was of international concern before the date of royal assent of the Act, as originally passed, and continued to be of international concern up to (and after) the date of royal assent of the 1987 Amending Act. The evidence also established that States were expected, if not required, to take prophylactic measures to prevent and deter conduct within their own territories which was intended to support such incursions into the territories of other States. In these circumstances, I regard s 7(1)(e) as valid because it falls within the international concern aspect of the external affairs power.
	


Whether s 7(1)(e) is authorised by the external affairs power if it is regarded as giving effect to the recommendations of international agencies in pursuit of international objectives


	
	It will be seen from the reasons set out above, that there may, in cases such as the present, be considerable overlap between the various aspects of the external affairs power. It was common ground that the treaty aspect was not engaged in the present case. However, the Commonwealth submitted that the recommendations of international agencies such as the UN, in pursuit of international objectives, enlivened the external affairs power. I regard the express approval by the majority in the Industrial Relations Act Case at 483 of the dicta of Evatt and McTiernan JJ in The King v Burgess; ex parte Henry as establishing the proposition for which the Commonwealth contended. Thus, it is not, in my view, to the point that, unlike treaties, the “recommendations” do not necessarily impose legal duties on States to take certain steps and enact laws with a particular effect.
	
	
	The external affairs power authorised the Commonwealth to carry into effect legislation which can be regarded as having as its purpose the implementation of the recommendations in the Friendly Relations Declaration. It is not necessary to consider the limits of this aspect of the external affairs power in circumstances such as the present case where the recommendations pertained to a subject of international concern, and (to borrow the words of Evatt and McTiernan JJ) “of concern to Australia as a member of the family of nations”.
	


Conclusion


	
	My view that s 7(1)(e) is a valid law with respect to external affairs makes it unnecessary to consider either the defence power or the incidental power (and whether, as contended by the plaintiff, the latter incorporates a requirement of proportionality).
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff accepted that costs ought follow the event in the declaratory proceedings. No order for costs may be made in the criminal proceedings.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	


In proceedings 363649 of 2013:


	
	Dismiss the applicant’s (accused’s) notice of motion filed on 27 July 2015.
	


In proceedings 226628 of 2015:


	
	Dismiss the amended summons.
	
	
	Order the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs of the proceedings.

		27 August 2015",2015-08-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702840,R v Sanchez [2015] NSWDC 394,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Whilst living in the United States of America the offender Mario Sanchez was offered a job. He was told that he would be paid $5,000 plus expenses to travel to Australia and perform the very simple task of collecting money from location A and taking it to location B. His suspicions were undoubtedly aroused by this offer. He sought reassurance. The person who asked him, the brother of his ex-wife, assured him that everything was above board and so Mr Sanchez came to Australia in order to earn that money.
	
	
	Today he gave evidence that he did not believe that when he came to Australia he was going to be involved in anything criminal and that that realisation only came to him as he was on his way to location A to pick up the money.
	
	
	I reject that. It is inconceivable that the offender could have thought that everything was above board, given the nature of the task required of him, moving money from one location to another and the amount which he was to be paid. I will sentence the offender on this basis: He realised there was a significant risk when he came into Australia that he was here for an illegal purpose.
	
	
	The offender arrived in Australia on 30 March having agreed that he would do what his ex-brother-in-law asked him to. He booked into a hotel and the following day went to an address at Arndell Park where he got a large sum of money, slightly more than $400,000 in cash. He took that back to his hotel room and was in the process of counting it when police officers entered.
	
	
	The offender has now pleaded guilty to an offence of dealing with money, being Australia currency worth more than $100,000, which is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The maximum penalty for that offence is three years imprisonment, the maximum penalty having relatively recently been increased.
	
	
	Of course one way that the authorities attempt to deal with crime is by intercepting the proceeds and making it harder for criminals to obtain their ill-gotten gains. Thus offences of the type for which Mr Sanchez pleaded guilty are important weapons in the armoury which the authorities use to fight crime.
	
	
	His offence was serious for that reason. He is a man who has just turned 39 in fact he had his 39th birthday in custody a few days ago. He is of prior good character. He left Cuba and moved to America to live with his father. He has four children, two aged 18 and 13 were living with him before he left to come to Australia and commit this offence. And he has two other children who live with their mother, they are aged six and 11 and the offender assists them by sending money to them.
	
	
	His father has apparently recently been diagnosed with leukaemia. The hardship to third parties occasioned by sentencing Mr Sanchez to gaol is certainly not exceptional but it is part of the general mix of subjective factors and certainly he will do his time in custody harder, knowing that his father is ill and that his children need his help. On the other hand not too much can be made of the fact that the offender will be serving his sentence in a foreign country. He came to Australia, as I have said, at least suspicious of the illegality of what he was being asked to perform.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and in that regard he has also assisted the authorities in two respects. He has told police apparently all he knew about where the money came from and where it was to go and since he has been in custody, has assisted the authorities in another way. There was an allegation of an assault upon his cellmate by four prison officers. The offender has provided statements to police about that matter. Somewhat remarkably the evidence would suggest those four corrective service officers still work in the pod where Mr Sanchez is incarcerated. That is enough to indicate again how Mr Sanchez will do his time in custody harder than would ordinarily be the case. In order to reflect Mr Sanchez’s willingness to assist the authorities by pleading guilty and his assistance to the authorities I will impose him a sentence which is 40% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Consistent with Mr Sanchez’s prior good character he has expressed his remorse and done well in custody, behaving himself and participating, as the reference from the chaplain indicates, in activities of a positive nature. I believe that his remorse, which he expressed today, is genuine.
	
	
	It remains however the case that his conduct was serious and he went into this with his eyes open. A sentence of full time custody is therefore required.
	
	
	He has done almost five months in custody so far. Ms Manea who appears for him today submitted that that was enough, I do not agree. A further period, albeit a short further period of full time custody is required in order to reflect the objective gravity of his conduct.
	
	
	The order I make is this the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a sentence of 12 months to have commenced on 31 March 2015. He is to be released after serving six months that is on 30 September 2015 upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of six months expiring on 30 March 2016.
	
	
	Mr Sanchez let me just explain to you what I’ve done. The thing you really want to know is how long further you have to do in prison. You will be released on 30 September 2015 that’s just more than a month from today okay. I presume you will then be deported but that’s not a matter for me, it’s a matter for other people. But in any case as far as I am concerned, as far as you are concerned the sentence that I imposed upon you requires that you spent slightly more than a month more in custody okay, do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Take a seat.
	
	
	DUNSTAN: Your Honour can I just check something in terms of the cognisance release order he may be required to set some sort of surety it can be self in the sum of a nominal sum.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Self in the sum of $500. Thank you for your assistance.

		20 May 2016",2015-08-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702842,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v NW [2015] NSWChC 3,"Judgment

The Charges and the plea


	
	The young person, NW, was charged that on 12 February 2015 he committed an indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years, to wit 5 years.
	
	
	He pleaded not guilty and the matter was set down for hearing. The issue for determination at this point is whether the presumption of doli incapax has been rebutted. The young person was approximately 13 years and 1 month old at the time of the alleged offence.
	


Defended Hearing


	
	The hearing commenced on 26 August 2015 by way of a voir dire concerning the issue of doli incapax. The DPP provided a brief opening. I note that the opening related to the entire case, and not simply the doli incapax issue. For the purpose of determining that issue, I can only have regard to the evidence before me on the voir dire – material contained in an opening is of course not evidence.
	
	
	By consent, the transcript of interview of the complainant AB was tendered (Exhibit VD1). Complaint was made very soon after the incident. In brief, AB told investigating officers that she was outside when NW took down her pants. She said “No…and he started doing it…..putting the stick up my bum and it hurt.” The interview took place at a hospital the day after the incident. There is no evidence before me on the voir dire as to the extent of injuries, if any.
	
	
	The complainant’s grandmother (JF) gave evidence that a Department of Family and Community Services caseworker, Mr Thurston, asked her to take NW into her care (as a registered foster carer) on 2 May 2014. The young person remained in her care until the time of the incident on 12 February 2015.
	
	
	JF was made aware by Mr Thurston that NW was to attend Rural New Street (RNS). A pamphlet from RNS, tendered by consent through the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Locke (Exhibit VD4) confirmed JF’s evidence that RNS is a (specialised) counselling service for children who have sexually harmed another person. JF said that NW had his own case worker, Kate, who spoke with JF and NW every Monday about what NW is, and is not, allowed to do (e.g. not play with any child under his age); what games he is not allowed to play (e.g. Hide and Seek); what is good touching and what is bad touching. A Safety Plan was put in place. JF said that NW fiddled with his fingers and didn’t react in any way when things were explained to him.
	
	
	Detective Locke said that NW attended RNS from 2 June 2014 until 9 February 2015 (a period of 8 months and 1 week). The last attendance was 9 February 2015, though there was no evidence as to whether the incident of 12 February caused an end to his attendance, or whether he had simply stopped going from 9 February.
	
	
	In July 2014, JF’s grandchildren AB (the complainant) and K came to live with her. Around Christmas 2014, another of JF’s grandchildren was at her home – a 5 year old, U. JF found NW holding U by the arms and rubbing U’s head into NW’s groin. She said that NW had been to so many meetings (with RNS). He was sent to his room. She asked him “Why have I put you in the bedroom?” NW said, “For touching U.”
	
	
	Another incident occurred in January 2015, when NW had AB on his shoulders taking her down the side of the house. Asked why he was going to his room this time, NW said, “For picking her up. I was getting her a drink.” A photo was tendered by consent (Exhibit VD2) showing the rear yard of JF’s home. She marked an area that NW was not allowed to take the children to. She also marked the area where the January incident occurred, saying that NW had been told ‘everyday’ not to take children to that area.
	
	
	JF said that she was present with NW at RNS when Kate the case worker showed NW a diagram of a human body, male and female, front and back, with ‘boobs, private parts and groin’ marked. This was to do with the good touching/bad touching discussion.
	
	
	In cross examination, it was suggested to JF that if the grandchildren cried, she would automatically blame NW. This was denied by JF, indicating that in such circumstances she would ask the girls first. It was suggested that NW was always being told that he had done something wrong. JF said that NW would be praised when he did something good. He might be taken to the park or bought something (e.g. a hat). An example of him doing something good was by mowing the lawns every Sunday. JF thought NW was good at computer games. He did not attend school in 2014 from the time of placement until the end of the year, but then commenced distance education.
	
	
	I found JF to be a credible witness who did not embellish or exaggerate matters.
	
	
	AM gave evidence. She said that there was an incident involving her 6 year old son TM and NW of a sexual nature, in January 2014. She took NW aside and spoke with him. NW said words to the effect, “It had happened to me in numerous other homes and that it is the right thing to do.” AM told him, “It’s never the right thing to do. It happened to me when I was younger and the people got into a lot of trouble for it.” NW started crying and apologised, saying that he was “sorry that he’d done that.” He promised “never to do it again” and that he would ask his carers (MR and RS) to help him with counselling. She said that NW looked up to her like an older sister. She told him that “the last person that did that to me went to gaol.” NW cried. She said that NW did not always listen to her, but she believed him when he promised never to do it again. It should be noted that the care of NW was transferred from MR and RS to JF after this incident. I found AM to be a compelling, credible and honest witness.
	
	
	MR was carer for NW from early 2013 for approximately 12 months. There was an incident with her grandson, TM (son of AM) of a sexual nature. She questioned NW about why he did what he did, to which he replied, “What? I didn’t do anything wrong.” I note that this conversation was not long prior to the conversation referred to above between AM and NW. MR said that she explained to NW about inappropriate touching “ten times over and another ten times”. She was shown a document comprising 17 pages which included a Post Suspension Readmission Agreement relating to a school suspension. MR said that NW signed the document. There is reference in attached documents to the fact that he “enjoys praise and rewards; takes pride in his bookwork, and his written work is always presented neatly” (as at 17.9.12). There are comments in an Education Plan with the heading Young Person’s Input on Education Plan which give some insight about NW’s ability to reflect on his education. There was a further suspension in April 2014 for aggressive behaviour.
	
	
	In a document from the school that he was attending dated 15 June 2014, it was noted that:
	


… the student required explicit instruction to follow two step commands on a one to one basis with distractions removed to prevent incidents and or injuries from occurring to himself or his peers. The student was escorted to class as a result of excessive truanting. The student was supervised directly in the playground setting to prevent incidents of physical and verbal violence from occurring due to a lack of expressive and receptive skills and poor social skills.

Further:

The student was removed from the carer in the [town] setting due to an allegation made from the carer about the student. The student was part way involved in a cognitive and behavioural assessment being conducted in which the outcome resulted as mild intellectual disability processed whilst the student was awaiting a new placement out of the [town] area.

The documents were tendered by consent (Exhibit VD3). No independent psychological evidence was tendered to support or rebut the words found in that document.


	
	RS gave evidence. He is the partner of MR. Part of his evidence involved noticing that NW would masturbate profusely – 4 to 5 times a day. He found him lying on his back in the yard masturbating and said words to the effect, “I’m a boy, but it is disgusting to do it in public. Do it in private.” Every time that he caught him masturbating, he would say not to do it. He caught him looking over the fence towards a neighbour in a pool, whilst masturbating. Eventually, RS gave up and told his wife.
	
	
	JL was a former carer of NW from when he was 8 years old for a period of 18 months. Given his age at that time, it would be not appropriate in my opinion for me to take into account her observations of NW when he was that age. Her observations, if taken into account, would not assist NW.
	
	
	AT was NW’s case worker from FACS. He attended JF’s place on 27 May 2014, very shortly after the placement commenced, and took NW for a drive to explain to him the reason about the change of placement. He said, “It was due to your behaviour and what had happened with a child in the previous placement”, he couldn’t be placed with other children. The issue of consequences for actions is raised again. He asked NW if he understood and he just nodded and put his head down. I am satisfied from AT’s evidence that he believed that NW understood. He informed NW that RNS would start work with him, but did not explain what RNS was about.
	


Case Law and Legislation


	
	On the day of hearing, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal handed down a decision on doli incapax: RP v R [2015] NSWCCA 215. Johnson J (agreeing with Davies J, with Hamill J reaching a different conclusion on count 3) held that “the doli incapax issue will be considered in the context of the developing understanding of a child which takes into account the child’s previous acts, knowledge and experiences.”
	
	
	Davies J set out a number of legal principles, citing various decisions. In BP v R; SW v R [2006] NSWCCA 172 at [27] per Hodgson JA (Adams and Johnson JJ agreeing), reference was made to the modification to the common law regarding the criminal responsibility of children in NSW by s 5 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which provides that no child under the age of 10 years can be guilty of an offence. The common law presumption remains that a child aged between 10 and 14 is doli incapax, i.e. incapable of committing a crime because of a lack of understanding between right and wrong, with a lack of mens rea. It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the child not only did the act as charged, but that they also had the necessary element, and at the time, knew it was seriously wrong rather than being an act of “mere naughtiness or mischief”.
	
	
	In BP v R; SW v R at [28]:
	


… the child must know that the act is seriously wrong as a matter of morality, or according to the ordinary principles of reasonable persons, not that it is a crime or contrary to law: Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, The Queen v M.


	
	At [29], “evidence to prove the child’s guilty knowledge must not be the mere proof of doing the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong the act may be”: see C (A Minor) v DPP [1995] UKHL 15 at [38]. The court noted that C v DPP was said in R v CRH (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 December 1996, unrep) to represent the common law in Australia, though it was strongly disapproved in the Victorian court of Appeal in R v ALH [2003] VSCA 129.
	
	
	At [30], it was held that it was unnecessary to resolve the conflict as there was evidence in addition to the mere doing of the acts charged, noting that “there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence.” An example was given of evidence that could support the inference that “the accused knew what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being and as such was seriously wrong” – the victim crying, screaming, struggling and asking the accused to stop. It was said that such evidence, together with “evidence that the accused asked another person to stop the victim screaming and continued what he was doing after the victim said she would tell police”, as well as a statement from another witness, was in Hodgson JA’s opinion “plainly sufficient to base a finding by the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that [the accused] had sufficient understanding of the wrongness of his conduct.”
	
	
	In RP v R at [36], Davies J cited C v DPP at [38]:
	


The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge. The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what the defendant said or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty mind.


	
	In RP v R at [53]:
	


A determination of whether a child aged between 10 and 14 years is doli incapax is a question of fact for a jury. It must also be acknowledged that determination of the issue is largely one of impression. Logic and reasoning take the matter only so far. There is no bright line between a realisation that an act or particular behaviour is simply naughty or mischievous and a realisation that it is seriously wrong.


	
	In RH v DPP (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 305, citing the decision of Hoeben CJ at CL in RH v DPP (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 520 at [22], it was affirmed that “the test whether the prosecution had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in favour of [the accused] was a subjective one.”
	


Factors that may rebut the presumption of doli incapax


	
	The following factors go to the rebuttal of the presumption:
	



	
	Previous consequences for actions of the young person, including: being moved to a different carer following a sexual incident prior to May 2014; being sent to his room following a sexual incident involving U; being sent to Rural New Street specialised counselling for children and young persons who have sexually harmed another person; frequently being reminded of rules, what behaviour is not appropriate, and being sent to his room following a sexualized incident with TM.
	
	
	The fact that the young person underwent specialised counselling with RNS for in excess of 8 months, which included a Safety Plan, setting boundaries regarding what games were not to be played, and receiving instruction concerning good touch and bad touch or inappropriate touch areas including reference to a diagram of the body, with anterior and posterior aspects showing breasts, genital areas and the bottom.
	
	
	The conversation held with AM following a sexual incident with TM which included words and actions consistent with an understanding that such actions are “never the right thing to do”, including a promise never to do it again (early 2014) and an indication that he would ask his carer’s to help him get counselling (noting counselling started in June 2014), and that he apologised and started to cry.
	
	
	The removal of the complainant’s pants despite the house rules, the Safety Plan, the counselling, the reminder of what is and is not appropriate.
	
	
	The protestation of the complainant, aged 5, saying “No” to NW to both the removal of the pants and the subsequent assault with the stick.
	
	
	The sexualized nature of the allegation – inserting a stick into the bottom of the complainant.
	
	
	The insertion of a stick into the bottom of a 5 year old child is heinous. The application of a stick to the bottom of a 5 year old child is heinous. Either way, such acts are more obviously wrong than for example publicly masturbating whilst watching a neighbour in a pool.
	
	
	The age of NW coupled with the nature of the offence alleged make it easier to rebut the presumption.
	
	
	The incident on 12 February 2015 closely follows in time the incidents from Christmas 2014 and January 2015 which had consequences.
	
	
	The nature of the incident is not identical, nor similar, to previous sexualized behaviour referred to in evidence, although the details of those incidents are sparse in these proceedings. There is no evidence of use of a stick or implement or weapon in previous incidents or any incident giving rise to some form of disciplinary action, whether at home or at school.
	
	
	There is evidence of aggressive behaviour at school with consequences of suspension, and a signed acknowledgment as part of a post suspension interview accepting the consequences of his actions as well as future conduct (p 1, Exhibit VD3).
	



	
	In RP v R at [159], Hamill J accepted that “evidence supported that the Applicant was of very low intelligence [borderline intellectual disability] and possessed a lesser appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct.” Notwithstanding that, each Justice concluded that with respect to at least one count (count 2), doli incapax was rebutted, and by majority, with respect to 2 counts (counts 2 and 3) which occurred months apart. Whilst the modicum of evidence relating to the young person’s mental state allows for a finding that the he is of low intelligence, I am not satisfied on the evidence that he possessed a lesser appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct for the matter before this court.
	
	
	I have considered the evidence concerning the initial comments made to AM following the incident with TM, namely that due to things that he had experienced, he thought that (what he did) was the right thing to do. However, I note his promise to AM, his apology, his reaction of crying and the fact that the conduct referred to at that time did not involve the removal of the pants of a 5 year old and the use of a stick to assault that child in or on her bottom. I also observe the actions giving rise to the communication with AM occurred prior to the protracted RNS counselling, and prior to the apparent caring and disciplined care provided by JF. There is absolutely no suggestion that whatever the young person had previously experienced was of any similarity to the conduct complained of by AB.
	
	
	In R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13 at [48], it was said that:
	


Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal.


	
	Under the circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that NW knew that what he was doing was gravely or seriously wrong in a moral sense. Accordingly, I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the prosecution have rebutted the presumption of doli incapax.
	


Orders


	
	The presumption of doli incapax is rebutted.

2702843,ER v Khan [2015] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: These proceedings are brought by the applicant, ER, pursuant to s 5F (3AA(c)) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against a determination made by the District Court of New South Wales (his Honour, Judge McClintock SC) on 20 May 2015 that documents produced under two subpoenas do not contain protected confidences within the meaning of Division 2 of Part 5 of Chapter 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The application to this Court under s 5F (3AA(c)) Criminal Appeal Act on behalf of the applicant/complainant was filed on 27 May 2015 and subsequently listed for call-over on 4 June 2015.
	
	
	The respondent, John Leslie Khan, has been charged with a number of offences alleged to have been committed by him against the applicant on 24 September 2014. In broad terms, it is alleged that he had sexual intercourse with the applicant/complainant without her consent and that he detained her for his sexual advantage. She was, as at that date, 15 years of age.
	
	
	The trial of the proceedings in the District Court, originally listed to commence on 4 May 2015, was adjourned pending the determination of the present application. A second trial date of 6 June 2015 was also vacated following an order by the District Court staying access to the subpoenaed material.
	
	
	The respondent is presently in custody and is bail refused.
	
	
	The provisions of s 5F(3AA) and (3AB), so far as relevant to the present application, are in the following terms:
	


5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order

…

(3AA)   A person who is not a party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a decision in those proceedings to grant leave under Division 2 of Part 5 of Chapter 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or a determination in those proceedings that a document or evidence does not contain a protected confidence within the meaning of that Division, if the person is:

(a)   …

(b)   …

(c)   a person who claims the document or evidence does, despite the determination, contain a protected confidence in relation to which the person is a protected confider.

(3AB)   An appeal under subsection (3AA) may be made whether or not an appeal has been made by a party to the proceedings, but only if:

(a)   the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or

(b)   …


	
	The indictment presented against the respondent charges him with the following offences:
	


Count 1: that he, on or about 24 September 2014, at Malabar in the State of New South Wales did assault [PCC] and that at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on [PCC], she being then under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age: s 61M(2) Crimes Act.

Count 9 is in the same terms.

Count 2: that he, on or about 24 September 2014, at Malabar in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [PCC] without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time [PCC] was under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age: s 61J(1) Crimes Act.

Counts 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are in the same terms and relate to separate acts of sexual penetration.

Count 5: that he, on or about 24 September 2014, at Malabar in the State of New South Wales did detain [PCC] without her consent with intent to obtain an advantage, namely sexual intercourse and at the time of the detention actual bodily harm was occasioned to [PCC]: s 86(2)(b) Crimes Act. The actual bodily harm asserted is a small amount of bruising.

The respondent has pleaded not guilty to each count on the indictment.

Documents Sought Under Subpoena


	
	On 17 April 2015, the respondent issued two subpoenas for production of documents in the District Court proceedings, one addressed to the Commissioner of Police (“the Commissioner”) and the other to the Department of Family and Community Services (“FACS”). They were both returnable on 21 April 2015.
	
	
	The Commissioner and FACS applied to have the respondent/accused’s subpoenas set aside and for an order preventing access to the subpoenaed documents on the basis that they were privileged.
	
	
	McClintock DCJ heard and subsequently determined all issues raised in relation to the subpoenaed documents by two separate judgments, the first delivered on 8 May 2015 and the second on 20 May 2015.
	
	
	In the first judgment, McClintock DCJ effectively refused the applications by the Commissioner and FACS to set aside the subpoenas.
	
	
	In the second judgment, his Honour noted that the material identified in the subpoenas had been produced and that access to it was sought (p 2). His Honour there noted:
	


“The issue in the present judgment is whether all, or any, of the documents subpoenaed fall within the ambit of Division 2 Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In other words, are there documents the subject to [sic] sexual assault communications privilege.

The subpoenas as they were drafted specifically indicated that they did not seek material that was the subject of sexual assault communications privilege. The accused does not seek access to that material. No leave was sought or given for the issue of the subpoenas. No issue is taken in respect of leave to issue. Mr Stidwill, who appears for the protected provider, claims in written submissions that the whole of the documents produced are protected confidences. It becomes necessary to examine what are ‘protected confidences’.”


	
	On the hearing of the application to set aside the subpoenas the respondent affirmed that no confidential communications were sought pursuant to them.
	
	
	In the first of two hearings, the Commissioner and FACS submitted to McClintock DCJ that the subpoenas should be set aside for want of legitimate forensic purpose and upon the basis that the proper application of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 rendered any records inadmissible. The applicant/complainant was separately represented on the application to set aside the subpoenas. By the submissions advanced on her behalf she joined submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner and FACS that there was no legitimate forensic purpose for them.
	
	
	As noted in the respondent’s written submissions, in the judgment of 8 May 2015, his Honour, Judge McClintock observed:
	


“The fundamental issues in the trial centre on the credit of the complainant; whether her account of the incidents and her assertion, in particular that sexual intercourse took place without her consent, can be believed. She is the sole witness and for the prosecution to succeed, her account of the offences must be believable beyond reasonable doubt. The material subpoenaed points to unreliability and has apparent relevance and possible utility to the defence (p 23) …”


	
	Following his Honour’s ruling on 8 May 2015, the applicant/complainant, sought a determination that the documents produced by the Commissioner and FACS were “confidential communications”.  Whilst an order for access to the documents produced under the subpoenas was sought by the respondent, it was again emphasised in the submissions for the respondent that no protected confidences were sought.
	
	
	The documents that had been produced by the Commissioner and FACS were tendered in order to permit his Honour to make the relevant determinations. In addition, affidavits were read (discussed below) and a summary of each of the separate documents was provided to his Honour by the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour made determinations with respect to each of the separate documents. There were 15 separate determinations in relation to the documents produced by the Commissioner. There were 115 separate determinations made in relation to the FACS documents produced in answer to the subpoena, making a total of 130 documents. They included more than 240 pages of material that had been produced in the FACS file alone.
	
	
	On 20 May 2015, as earlier indicated, his Honour determined that each individual document produced by the Commissioner was not a protected counselling communication. His Honour individually determined whether each of the documents produced by FACS constituted a protected counselling communication. His Honour made a number of determinations in respect of certain FACS documents that they were not protected confidences.
	
	
	It is in respect of these determinations that the current application is made to this Court.
	


The Legislative Scheme

(a) The Scheme


	
	Before turning to the submissions made on behalf of the parties to the present application, it is necessary to refer in some detail to the scheme that provides for sexual assault communications privilege and which privilege operates to prevent the disclosure of communications that were made for the purpose of counselling a complainant of sexual assault in the circumstances prescribed by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	Part 5 – Evidence in sexual offence proceedings – contains four Divisions. Division 2 contains provisions that establish and concern the privilege, entitled “Sexual assault communications privilege”, in respect of protected confidences. Division 2 comprises ss 295-306 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Central to his Honour’s judgment of 20 May 2015 was the question as to whether the documents produced under the subpoenas were, or related to, a protected confidence under s 296 and for that purpose, as his Honour observed, it was necessary for him to inspect each document: Judgment, 20 May 2015 at p 9.
	
	
	His Honour observed that in the event of a determination being made that any particular document constituted a protected confidence, a number of issues would arise in respect of granting leave (in particular, issues arising in terms of the provisions of s 299D). His Honour observed:
	


“… however such issues do not arise in the present circumstances as the accused does not presently seek access to any relevant counselling communication.” (at p 9)


	
	His Honour proceeded:
	


“It is necessary to consider whether the communications in the documents are within the definition of a ‘counselling communication’. A first step is that counselling communications cannot be made unless they are made in confidence.” (at p 9)


	
	His Honour, after referring to the fact that different views had been expressed as to the ambit of the expression “counselling communication” (at pp 9-10), observed:
	


“The precise interpretation of the ambit of the provisions was not authoritatively determined by the decision in KS v Veitch (No 2) (2012) 84 NSW Law Reports 172. I tend to sympathise with the reasoning of his Honour Judge Williams in Veitch (2013) 16 District Court Reports 181 at par 23, in respect of the definition. However in these proceedings, I take a much broader view than Judge Williams in relation to the ambit of ‘counselling’, accepting that it incorporates counselling relevant to the present circumstances that relates to prior sexual assaults. In the circumstances, I find it covers the present counselling in respect of alleged sexual assaults other than sexual assaults that are the subject of the proceedings.” (at p 10).

(b) The Relevant Provisions


	
	Section 295(1) contains definitions of words and expressions employed in Division 2.
	
	
	“Principal protected confider” means “the victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault by, to or about whom a protected confidence is made”.
	
	
	As to the expression “Protected confidence” the definition provision states “see section 296”.
	
	
	“Protected confider”, in relation to a protected confidence is defined as meaning:
	


(a)   the principal protected confider, or

(b)   any other person who made the protected confidence.


	
	“Sexual assault offence” is defined as meaning:
	


(a)   a prescribed sexual offence, or

(a1)   acts that would constitute a prescribed sexual offence if those acts

(i)   had occurred in this state, or

(ii)   had occurred at some later date,

(iii)   had occurred in this State and occurred at some later date, or

(b)   any other offence prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition.


	
	Section 295, Interpretation, includes in subsection (2) the following:
	


“Document recording a protected confidence

In this Division a reference to a document recording a protected confidence:

(a)   is a reference to any part of the document that records a protected confidence or any report, observation, opinion, advice, recommendation or other matter that relates to the protected confidence made by a protected confider, and

(b)   includes a reference to any copy, reproduction or duplicate of that part of the document.”


	
	Section 296 is in the following terms:
	


296 What is a protected confidence?

(1)   In this Division:

protected confidence means a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence.

(2)   A counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of this Division even if it:

(a)   was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or

(b)   was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence or any condition arising from a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence.

(3)   For the purposes of this section, a communication may be made in confidence even if it is made in the presence of a third party if the third party is present to facilitate communication or to otherwise further the counselling process.

(4)   In this section:

counselling communication means a communication:

(a)   made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or

(b)   made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or

(c)   made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or

(d)   made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person.

(5)   For the purposes of this section, a person counsels another person if:

(a)   the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and

(b)   the person:

(i)   listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or

(ii)   advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,

whether or not for fee or reward.


	
	The provisions of s 299 address the requirement that a witness, party or protected confider who may have grounds for making an application under Division 2 for objecting to the production of a document or the adducing of evidence be provided with a reasonable opportunity to seek legal advice.
	
	
	Section 299A provides that a protected confider who is not a party may appear in criminal proceedings or preliminary criminal proceedings if a document is sought to be produced or evidence is sought to be adduced that may disclose a protected confidence made by, to or about the protected confider. As noted above, the applicant/complainant had standing by virtue of s299A and was heard on the respondent’s application.
	
	
	Section 299B deals with the basis for determining whether there is a protected confidence. It is in the following terms:
	


299B Determining if there is a protected confidence

(1)   If a question arises under this Division relating to a document or evidence, a court may consider the document or evidence.

(2)   If there is a jury, the document or evidence is to be considered in the absence of the jury.

(3)   A court must not make available or disclose to a party (other than a protected confider) any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:

(a)   the court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence, or

(b)   a party has been given leave under this Division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.

(4)   A court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.

(5)   This section has effect despite sections 297 and 298.

The District Court’s Determination in this Case


	
	In his judgment of 20 May 2015, his Honour specifically considered the provisions concerning protected confidences, including in particular the definition of “counselling communication” (at pp 7-9).
	
	
	He noted that it had been submitted on behalf of the applicant/complainant that the whole of the FACS file was a protected confidence under s 296(1) and that this was said to be so because:
	


“… anything contained therein was made because of the current allegations or made before the current allegations or was made in connection with allegations. He asserts that whilst the file contains documents which are not, on their face, contact between the author of the document and the Protected Confider, nevertheless section 295(2) protects the documents because they are reports, observations et cetera that relate to the protected confider. The effect of the ambit of Mr Stidwill’s submissions is that anything said by a FACS officer in the file concerning the Protected Provider is protected. This has the somewhat unusual effect of apparently protecting any police documents that appear in the FACS files. Further, as I understand it, it is his submission that because investigations are undertaken by a Joint Investigation Response team (JIRT) which includes FACS officers, everything associated with the investigation is privileged.” (at pp 10-11)


	
	His Honour then proceeded:
	


“I am of the view that the provisions are designed to protect the Protected Provider from disclosure of matters relating to counselling with its focus on harm and on persons trained to find and treat such harm. It is not intended to protect the Protected Person from disclosures relating to reports about them that do not originate from such processes or do not refer to such process.

However, as I have already noted, I do accept that the provision relates to counselling that predates the existence of the sexual assault the subject of the present charges. The wide ambit of the definitions seem to accept that counselling a person in respect of a previous sexual assault is caught by the sections and accordingly I intend to apply that when considering each piece of individual material.” (at p 11)


	
	His Honour observed that the decision of this Court in PPC v Williams [2013] NSWCCA 286 had the effect of requiring him to go through every document in the files produced and make a determination in respect of whether each concerned matters related to counselling as defined. His Honour stated:
	


“In this process I use an interpretation of counselling which includes any counselling of the Protected Provider in respect of any sexual assault.” (at p 11)


	
	His Honour referred to a “Schedule of Claims” prepared by Mr Stidwill who appeared in the District Court on behalf of the applicant/complainant. His Honour stated that he was required to consider each document or class of document (if such an attribution was possible):
	


“… to ascertain whether they fall within the ambit of the section as a protected confidence. I do not have to consider whether leave is to be granted and if they fall within section 299D.” (at pp 11-12)


	
	The documents that were referred to in the above schedule were each identified by date and page, the documents not having been sequentially numbered. His Honour then made rulings in respect of the particular documents at pages 12-29 of the second judgment delivered on 20 May 2015. Pursuant to those rulings, access was denied in relation to some documents while being granted in relation to others. The applicant/complainant contends that access should not have been granted to certain documents.
	


Amended Grounds – An Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	The applicant in support of her application relied upon the following two amended grounds:
	


1.   His Honour erred in finding that certain documents produced under subpoenas were not protected confidences.

2.   His Honour erred in that he:

a.   failed to make findings on the central issue, ie protected confidence and counselling communications.

b.   failed to explain how the findings he made were arrived at including reviewing the evidence and making findings upon it.

c.   failed to make note of all that was necessary to enable the case to be laid properly and sufficiently before an appellate court.

d.   erred in the fact-finding process in that he failed to examine the relevant material, make findings of fact so as to determine if there existed counselling communications.

Evidence


	
	The application book filed in this Court contained copies of the following:
	



	
	Affidavits relied upon by the applicant in the District Court proceedings, namely:

Submissions for the Applicant – Ground 1


	
	The applicant relied upon written submissions dated 13 July 2015 which were supplemented at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	At the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, Mr Little of counsel for the applicant/complainant provided this Court with a bundle of FACS documents being part of the documents considered by McClintock DCJ. However, no specific reference was made to them in the course of submissions.
	
	
	As to the question of leave, it was submitted that leave should be granted on the basis that there is no authority binding on courts of first instance dealing with:
	


“●   the nature and extent of the privilege;

●   whose privilege it is;

●   how and when it [may] cease or be removed;

●   what occurs if confidences are communicated without consent or misconduct to others, eg, by and to police.” (Applicant’s Written Submissions at pp 1-2)


	
	A further ground for leave was stated to be that the applicant has no other remedy and there is a potential injustice if the arguments advanced are held to be the law (Written Submissions at p 2).
	


Sexual Assault Communications Privilege


	
	It was submitted for the applicant that the provisions of Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act created a new form of privilege. They were said to constitute beneficial legislation which protected complainants in cases alleging sexual assault and that the legislation should to be interpreted purposively in giving effect to the policy as discussed, in particular, in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266; (2012) 84 NSWLR 172 at [18] and [34].
	
	
	It was observed that the privilege is that of the confider and the subject of it was stated to be:
	


“… the actual confidence and the recording of it in evidence or a document attracts the privilege simply because the confidence is recorded there.” (Written Submissions at p 4)


	
	It was further submitted:
	


“It follows that a restatement of the privilege within records does not give rise to a loss of the privilege or the passing on of details to another agency eg, police where the accused does not actively consent or loses it because of the effect of s 301.” (Written Submissions at p 4)


	
	It was further observed that for a person to be counselled about an event there needs to be a history or statement of what the event was and that its re-statement within records of an institution such as FACS does not remove the privilege. It was noted:
	


“Obviously if she [the applicant] then makes a fresh communication including say in the nature of a statement then there is no privilege attaching to that fresh communication.” (Written Submissions at p 4)


	
	It was further submitted:
	


“The issue before the District Court should have been limited to the question

‘Was there a record of a protected confidence?’

And if so there was to be no access claimed nor sought.” (Written Submissions at p 4)


	
	The submissions then addressed provisions as to the meaning of “protected confidence” (s 291(1))
	
	
	The Schedule to Ms Ghazzaoui’s affidavit set out the general nature and description of the claim for privilege in respect of each document to which access was sought together with the role and identity of any counsellor referred to in a particular document.
	
	
	It was submitted for the applicant that there was sufficient evidence in the Schedule, combined with the evidence in Ms Reye’s affidavit, to find that the documents in question contained “counselling communications” as defined in the Act (Written Submissions at p 7).
	


Respondent’s Submissions – Ground 1


	
	In the respondent’s written submissions it was stated that what is protected by the terms of the legislation is “confidential counselling, not reports to police, or documents generated during police or FACS investigations” (at [44]).
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that there is no indication in the legislation that:
	


“… reports to Police or FACS would be subject to any privilege. Given that such reports arise in almost every criminal trial where there is a sexual assault complaint, the absence of any reference to such reports or documents must be deliberate …” (Respondent’s Written Submissions at [46])


	
	Reference was made in the respondent’s written submissions to the second reading speech in relation to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Bill (2002) in which the then Attorney-General referred to the policy behind the provisions establishing the privilege:
	


“[T]he policy behind the sexual assault communication privilege is that the benefits of counselling services provided to sexual assault victims should not be compromised by the prospect that communications made in connection with those services may later be revealed to the accused or disclosed in court.”


	
	The respondent submitted:
	


“What has been enacted and amended numerous times is a detailed and clear legislative scheme for the protection of sexual assault counselling communications. The respondent seeks no such material. There is a vast difference between the counselling notes of a treating sexual assault counsellor on the one hand, describing personal thoughts, feelings and private information, and documents generated by the police or FACS on the other. Once a complaint has escalated to FACS or to the police, confidentiality can no longer apply to events that then occur; records kept of those events do not have the quality of counselling. Any reasonable expectation of confidentiality must by then be lost.” (Respondent’s Written Submissions at [49])


	
	In relation to the issues raised by Ground 1, the respondent noted that he is necessarily constrained by the lack of access to the material produced and any further information about such material.
	
	
	It was noted that if a document is a “counselling communication” then it must also fit within the definition of a “protected confidence”. To do so it must be a counselling communication made by, to or about the alleged victim. Read as a whole, s 296 contemplates that the communication referred to is the communication between the victim and the treating professional (with the single exception of a third person who is present to facilitate that communication or process): Respondent’s Written Submissions at [52].
	
	
	It was submitted that reporting a matter to police, a police investigation, notes about such an investigation, the opinions of the police or the result of investigations are clearly not “counselling communications” and cannot be “protected confidences”: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [52].
	
	
	Emphasis was given to the inclusion in s 296(4) of the words “made in confidence” as indicating the fundamental quality that a communication must have to permit categorisation of it as a “counselling communication”: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [53].
	
	
	It was contended for the respondent that his Honour did not fail to identify the essential issue, namely, whether any of the subpoenaed documents were “the subject of sexual assault communications privilege” (Judgment at p 2). It was noted by the respondent that his Honour had then identified the need to examine what were “protected confidences”, and set out the relevant provisions of Division 2. His Honour observed in relation to his approach:
	


“Where I identify a counselling communication relating to either the present matter or any other sexual assault matter or harm matter, I will indicate that that document falls within the ambit of the division [and not grant access].” (Judgment at p 15)


	
	The respondent’s submissions noted that his Honour carefully considered each document. This was said to be evident from the fact that at the end of the lengthy exercise undertaken, his Honour’s ruling disclosed four distinct determinations:
	


“(a)   documents that were clearly not protected confidences that were to be released;

(b)   documents over which there attached some uncertainty and upon which his Honour reserved pending further consideration;

(c)   documents where there was ‘derivative’ counselling material and which therefore contained protected disclosures and were not to be released; and

(d)   documents that contained direct reference to counselling and were accordingly not to be released.” (Respondent’s Written Submissions at [58])


	
	It was noted that his Honour made a number of determinations of “counselling” or “counselling document” and declined to grant access to such documents. It was submitted that his Honour’s analysis indicated a “sound interpretative method” and that no error was demonstrated either in the identification of the issue before the Court, nor in the determination of that issue.
	
	
	It was submitted for the respondent that the findings made were open and that no error had occurred: Respondent’s Written Submissions at [62].
	


Consideration

Ground 1


	
	The subpoenas to the Commissioner and to FACS were drafted upon the basis that they did not seek material that was the subject of sexual assault communication privilege. A statement to that effect appeared in the Schedule to each subpoena.
	
	
	In determining Ground 1, which in essence concerns the status or character of the subpoenaed documents, it is necessary to consider the nature and scope of the statutory privilege conferred by the provisions of Chapter 6, Division 2, Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	Sexual assault communication privilege attaches to a “protected confidence”, an expression that takes its meaning from s 296. Section 296(1) provides that “protected confidence”, inter alia, means a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence.
	
	
	The provisions of s 296 (set out in para [33] above) establish the statutory concept of a “counselling communication”. They define the metes and bounds of “protected confidence”.
	
	
	Central to sexual assault communications privilege are the concepts of “confidence” and “counselling”. They arise and apply where a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence has participated in “counselling” provided or conducted by a “counsellor”. Those concepts represent the foundation‑stone for the statutory privilege established by Division 2.
	
	
	In determining a claim of privilege under that Division it is necessary to determine in a particular case whether there existed a “counselling communication” within one or other of the four categories established by s 296(4).
	
	
	The first category is directed to a communication made by the counselled person “in confidence” to a counsellor being a person “who is counselling the person” etc: s 296(4)(a).
	
	
	Under s 296, the second category includes communications either to or about the counselled person by a counsellor in the course of the communication made “in confidence”: s 296(4)(b).
	
	
	“Counselling communication” within the third category includes a communication made by specified persons “about the counselled person”, namely communications either by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process: s 296(4)(c).
	
	
	“Counselling communication” within the fourth category includes a communication made either by or to the counsellor “in confidence”, or by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person: s 296(4)(d).
	
	
	In the present case a claim of sexual assault communications privilege was essentially sought on the basis of communications made either by or to the applicant/complainant or by others, including a counsellor.
	
	
	Whether or not a “counselling communication” existed in relation to any particular document depends upon the proper interpretation and application of the relevant provisions including, in particular, those in s 296(4) and (5) discussed above and the nature or content of the document.
	
	
	In determining if a protected confidence exists in relation to a particular document or other record a court is, of course, entitled to do so on the basis of an examination of the contents of a document or record and, as well, upon the basis of any evidence concerning or relating to the same or both: s 299B(1). As to the latter, the evidence in the present proceedings, including in particular the affidavit evidence referred to above at [44], is examined below.
	
	
	In determining if there is a protected confidence, s 299B(3) places constraints upon the court once a determination is made. Section 299B(3) provides:
	


(3)   A court must not make available or disclose to a party (other than a protected confider) any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:

(a)   the court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence, or

(b)   a party has been given leave under this Division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.


	
	McClintock DCJ gave particular attention to the provisions of s 299B at pages 2‑8 of his Honour’s judgment. This is a relevant matter in relation to Ground 2 of the application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	There was, and could have been, no issue as to the onus or burden of proof in establishing sexual assault communications privilege. As to the issue of the onus on a claim for legal professional privilege see Kennedy v Wallace (2004) 142 FCR 185; [2004] FCAFC 337 at [13]. Whilst the provisions of Division 2 do not expressly deal with that aspect, Mr Little of counsel, on behalf of the applicant, properly conceded that his client, in claiming that the documents in question were privileged, carried the onus of establishing that proposition.
	
	
	In the present case, it was open to the applicant to establish sexual assault communication privilege by evidence, including the evidence of any relevant counsellor and/or any other person in order to establish the nature or character of particular documents/records, as being, for example, a counsellor’s record of counselling communications such as notes or reports relating to a protected confidence that fell within one of the four categories referred to in s 296(4).
	
	
	The evidence does not indicate or establish that Ms Reyes, Ms Ingram or Ms Ghazzaoui had, alone or in conjunction with others, counselled the applicant within the terms of s 296(4) and (5). The applicant’s written submissions at pages 6-7 stated that Ms Reyes and Ms Ghazzaoui held qualifications and job descriptions of “a counsellor”. However, the evidence did not establish that any of them acted as a “counsellor” to the applicant as, for example, by providing support, advice, therapy or treatment for her in the course of counselling. The evidence of Ms Reyes, Ms Ingram and of Ms Ghazzaoui was not directed to establishing that any one of them had been a party to a “counselling communication” within s 296(4).
	
	
	Ms Reyes is an Acting Manager of Casework at the Joint Investigation Response Team (JIRT). She is a caseworker with FACS and she is also attached, as I have stated, to the JIRT. Ms Reyes stated that she perused the FACS file in relation to the applicant and in paras [7] to [31] of her affidavit made comments and observations upon specified documents on the FACS file. One of the documents had been prepared by her (referred to in para [16] of her affidavit). However, Ms Reyes’ affidavit does not state or identify that any document or record was in fact a protected confidence/counselling communication within s 296. Whilst the nature of the documents referred to in her affidavit and the circumstances in which they were created were addressed in her affidavit, there is no statement or indication by Ms Reyes that those documents were documents falling within s 296 or contained information based on or derived from communications made “in confidence” between the applicant and “a counsellor”. Nor were any facts or circumstances identified which characterised documents as counselling communications.
	
	
	Ms Ingram is employed by FACS, as at the date of her affidavit, as Manager, Client Services, Eastern Sydney Community Service Centre. In her affidavit Ms Ingram stated:
	


“4.   I have reviewed the documents collated by FACS which are responsive to the subpoena issued by the defence in this matter.

5.   I object to production of these documents. The documents contain material relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant (ie [ER]) and/or evidence that discloses or implies that the complainant may have had sexual experience or lack of sexual experience and that the complainant has or may have taken part or not taken part in sexual activities.

6.   I further object to production of the documents to the extent that they represent protected confidences within the meaning of s 296 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. From my review of the documents I believe that there are some documents which fall into this category.

7.   I further object to producing the documents to the extent that they contain information that could identify, or tend to identify, the author or [sic – of] reports in contravention of s 29 Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998. From my review of the documents I believe that there are some documents which fall into this category.”


	
	Ms Ingram did not identify any facts or circumstances which supported her implication that amongst the documents produced were documents that contained protected confidences.
	
	
	Ms Ghazzaoui, caseworker with FACS was attached to the JIRT. Ms Ghazzaoui in her affidavit at para [5] stated:
	


“I have worked with [ER] for a period of about 12 months. During that time I have counselled her regarding events occurring in her life pre August 2014. It is my opinion that [ER] would be greatly distressed if the events in her life not relating to the present charges were revealed to the accused or his legal team. I have witnessed [ER] distressed on a number of occasions when recounting events in her life to myself and other co workers.”


	
	Ms Ghazzaoui did not address in any of the paragraphs of her affidavit the character or status of particular documents the subject of the privilege claim.
	
	
	The Schedule to Ms Ghazzaoui’s affidavit comprises 15 pages. As noted above, it set out information under a number of headings, being Document Number, Document Title, Date of Document, Nature and Description of Claim and Role and Identity of Counsellor.
	
	
	In general terms, the information in the Schedule as to “Nature and Descriptions of Claim” consists of short or summary descriptions as to the circumstances in which particular documents were prepared. These included, for example, documents prepared by FACS caseworkers at community service centres operated by FACS, in some instances, based on or containing information from “contact records” or “reports” created from information given to the Child Help Protection Line. Other records included:
	



	
	Departmental (FACS) File notes.
	
	
	Home visit notes.
	
	
	JIRT interviews between specified personnel.
	
	
	Helpline caseworker notes.
	
	
	JIRT summaries based on contact reports.
	
	
	JIRT documents summarising JIRT actions and recording information received by caseworkers.
	
	
	FACS summaries of applicant’s history with FACS prepared by a FACS caseworker, being a summary of departmental records.
	
	
	Documents recording exchanges of information between police and FACS.
	
	
	Caseworker summaries concerning the applicant sourced from departmental databases including contact reports and other documents.
	
	
	A document for a meeting between police and FACs prepared from contact records.
	
	
	An assessment prepared to detail allegations and the JIRT response.
	
	
	A briefing note used at a meeting between Police, FACS and Department of Health.
	



	
	In relation to the Schedule I note:
	



	
	The entries under “Nature and descriptions of claim” do not expressly identify or refer to any particular document as being in fact a record of a “counselling communication” within the meaning of s 296 or as containing information derived from a counselling communication(s).
	
	
	Although the Schedule contains the names of persons under the sub-title “Role and identity of counsellor” it is clear from the terms of the Schedule that the persons so identified were not stated to have in fact undertaken counselling of the applicant within the meaning of s 296(4) or (5) or in particular, to have participated in a counselling communication with the applicant.
	



	
	As noted above, the evidence tendered in the District Court hearing included the JIRT Memorandum of Understanding. It is clear from that document that the role and responsibilities of officers who participated in JIRT activities or operations acted in joint investigatory activities and not activities involving or concerned with counselling communications within s 296.
	
	
	There was, in my assessment, no basis in the affidavit evidence before McClintock DCJ for a conclusion that any contact records or other documents referred to in the Schedule of Documents to Ms Ghazzaoui’s affidavit related directly to or were created derivatively from any counselling communications involving or concerning the applicant (subject to observations made below at [113]-[116]).
	
	
	In those circumstances, his Honour was required to proceed to determine the status or character of the subpoenaed documents and the claim of sexual assault communications privilege by a process of examining each document. This his Honour did with observations made by him in relation to each. I will return to this aspect below in relation to Ground 2.
	
	
	It is noted here, however, that his Honour upheld the claim of privilege in respect of a number of documents referred to in the Schedule to Ms Ghazzaoui’s affidavit.
	
	
	I would not uphold Ground 1.
	


Ground 2


	
	The applicant, as earlier noted, submitted that his Honour had erred in the respects set out in Ground 2(a), (b), (c) and (d) in the amended grounds. Each of those sub-paragraphs asserts error upon different bases. Properly understood they essentially assert error by the judge by way of failures by him to make “findings” as to “protected confidences” and “counselling communications” together with an asserted failure by his Honour to explain his reasoning process in relation to the rulings made, and a contention that his Honour failed to examine “relevant material”.
	
	
	The matters raised by Ground 2(a), (b), (c) and (d) must be considered in the particular context of the case, including the evidence adduced before his Honour, and the basis upon which he was required to determine the privilege claim. As to matters of context I note the following matters.
	
	
	As earlier observed, the affidavit material relied upon by the applicant/complainant before the judge was not directed to establishing relevant factual matters to support the privilege claimed. In relation to a claim for client legal privilege the authorities emphasise the need for focused and specific evidence in order to ground a claim for the privilege: see Barnes v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 88 at [18]; Bailey v Department of Land and Water Conservation [2009] NSWCA 100; (2009) 74 NSWLR 333 at [40]. The same requirement, in my opinion, exists with a claim for sexual assault communications privilege where there is a need for evidence to support his claim.
	
	
	In Kennedy v Wallace, supra, Black CJ and Emmett J observed:
	


“Mr Kennedy’s claim to legal professional privilege depends upon a positive finding about the purpose for which the two documents were brought into existence. The only evidence consisted of the assertions made by Mr Kennedy in his affidavits. Those assertions are conclusions that are not supported by any revealed reasoning process. Mr Kennedy gave no evidence as to the topics upon which he intended to consult Mr Hafner. He gave no evidence as to what he meant by ‘obtaining legal advice’ in his affidavit of 1 March 2004.

The appellant’s decision to base his claim for privilege in this way was attended with considerable risk since, as Lockhart J observed in National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211; 100 ALR 151 at 159, it is not sufficient for a party merely to assert a claim for privilege nor will an affidavit asserting the purpose for which the document was brought into existence followed by a statement about the category of legal professional privilege to which the document is said to belong necessarily be sufficient. Moreover, in the leading case of Grant v Downs (1976) 135 CLR 674; 11 ALR 577, Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ warned against the erroneous view that the privilege is ‘necessarily or conclusively established by resort to any verbal formula or ritual’: at CLR 689; ALR 589. In the same case, their Honours also observed that whatever the facts may be, it is always for the party claiming privilege to show that the documents for which the claim is made are in fact privileged.” (at [12]-[13])


	
	In the circumstances in which his Honour did not have the benefit of any evidence directly relevant to the characterisation of a very large number of documents, he was necessarily limited to examining each document and basing each determination as to “protected confidence” and “counselling communication” from the nature and/or contents of each.
	
	
	In circumstances such as these, the practical difficulties that face a judge in determining the existence of a protected confidence has previously been the subject of attention and discussion in NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25. Adams J observed:
	


“Speaking generally, it is obvious that the s 299D issues cannot be considered without examining the documents themselves or having sufficient information to make what might be called the statutory inquiries. The practical reality will almost invariably be that the documents have to be examined. That, indeed, was this case. Since reading the material was essential, the learned trial judge, in my respectful view, had a duty to do so, regardless whether or not it was requested. The application for access, which enlivened s 299D, of necessity implied a request to examine the material. (In my view, it should be inferred that his Honour did examine it.) I readily acknowledge that this places a heavy burden on trial judges but it is an inescapable consequence of the draconian terms in which the legislation is drafted. It might be appropriate for the Parliament to consider empowering the judge to give access to counsel for the Crown and defence to examine the material and make submissions (perhaps in writing to preserve confidence) on whether, and in what way, the s 299D tests are or are not satisfied. This would considerably simplify the judge's task. Such access could be subject to non-publication conditions, including a prohibition on disclosing the material to any other persons, including of course, either police or the accused.” (at [4])


	
	In an article published in the Judicial Officers’ Bulletin, April 2015, Vol 27, No 3, entitled “Use of the sexual assault communications privilege in sexual assault trials” by Ian Nash, Public Defender, the observation was made:
	


“As the legal representatives of the parties (other than those of the protected confider) can’t examine the documents prior to access being granted, their ability to assist the court is extremely limited (s 299B(3)). This creates particular difficulties when large quantities of documents fall within the terms of the subpoena and there is a dispute about whether any contain counselling communications. Judges are forced to examine each and every document, or each category of document (where documents related to the same incident or issue concerning the applicant) themselves for the purposes of determining the existence of any protected confidence.”(at p 26)


	
	As is apparent from the provisions of s 299B(1) (reproduced in para [36] above), a court determining a claim of sexual assault communications privilege may consider both the documents in question and/or evidence about them or their contents. Additionally, s 299B(4) provides:
	


“A court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.”


	
	This provision confers power upon a court to make orders that facilitate the task of determining whether sexual assault communications privilege exists. It has been observed in relation to client legal privilege, that a court may make orders allowing evidence to be given in confidence under such conditions as to preserve the claimed privilege (which the evidence was adduced to support): Kennedy v Wallace, supra, per Black CJ and Emmett J at [17]. Section 299B(4) in my opinion would similarly permit such a course to be taken when determining a question of sexual assault communications privilege.
	
	
	Regrettably, without evidence that addressed the facts said to found the privilege, his Honour was in a position whereby, doing the best he could, he was required to make rulings based on the contents of each of the documents. This is the relevant context to which I have earlier referred in considering Ground 2.
	
	
	Ground 2, in my opinion, proceeds upon the basis that there were factual questions requiring resolution or findings to be made on evidence. His Honour’s task, as I have indicated, was essentially an interpretive exercise based wholly upon an examination of each of the documents in question, there being no specific evidence that addressed or focused upon the circumstances in which documents were created or their possible connection with any protected confidence or counselling communications.
	
	
	An examination of the judgment of 20 May 2015, in particular in respect of the rulings at pages 12 to 29 under the sub-heading “Analysis of the Documents” reveals a methodical and careful examination made by his Honour in respect of which I note the following:
	



	
	The examination of each document was conducted with the relevant provisions of s 296 well in mind.
	
	
	Where there was a basis for a conclusion that certain documents were protected by the privilege his Honour so stated.
	
	
	In relation to documents in which the position was not sufficiently clear for a determination of the claimed privilege to be made, his Honour reserved for further determination the claim in respect of such documents.
	
	
	His Honour’s observations clearly demonstrate that he examined each of the documents for the purpose of determining whether the documents were in fact “counselling” records or whether they were departmental file records that contained within them material derived from documents that were protected confidences (termed by his Honour as “derivative” from original or source material).
	



	
	I have concluded that, in the circumstances in which the claim for privilege proceeded before his Honour, it has not been demonstrated that there was a failure by him to make findings or disclose the reasoning process associated with the rulings made. His Honour was constrained by the provisions of the Act (s 299B(3)) not to disclose the contents of any documents containing counselling communications. That constraint limited him in providing reasons that would expressly or inferentially disclose information as to any counselling communications.
	
	
	Subject to one matter referred to in the next paragraph below, I consider that the statements his Honour made by way of explanation in relation to each ruling were sufficient having regard to the circumstances and context in which the application was made.
	
	
	The document at pages 74-77 are described at p 6 of the Schedule to Ms Ghazzaoui’s affidavit under the sub-heading ‘Nature and description of claim’ as follows:
	


“Created by Colin Foster, helpline caseworker. The information in this contact report comes from Anna Fidis and the document indicates that Anna Fidis is a “counsellor”. The document on, page 3, indicates that the information within the contact reports comes from a counselling session…”


	
	His Honour, in relation to the documents at pages 74-77 made the following ruling:
	


“So far as the contact record at 74-77, there is reference in the submission to a person involved being a counsellor but notwithstanding the person being a counsellor or a wish that things be kept confidential, the matters must come within the ambit of the division. This, in fact, is a record of a third party contact. There is no counselling involved that I could ascertain. In the circumstances, it is not within the division and accordingly it is to be released.” (Judgment, 20 May 2015 at p 21)


	
	The ruling made in relation to these documents was that they were not protected by sexual assault communication privilege. His Honour’s reasons record, inter alia: “There is no counselling involved that I could ascertain”.  That statement is accurate as to the communication as between the parties to the Contact Record (Colin Foster and Ms Fidis). However Ms Fidis, counsellor, is identified as the source of the information in the Contact Report and that information is identified as being derived from “a counselling session”. In these circumstances I am of the opinion that the claim for privilege in relation to the document at pages 74-77 should be included in the documents his Honour reserved for further consideration (see para (3) in [110] above), and that the ruling made by his Honour in relation to them be reviewed in light of the above comments. I note that this Court has not had the benefit of seeing the documents. I acknowledge the possibility that there may be some material in them that supports his Honour’s determination.
	
	
	As it is not possible to reach any definitive conclusion as to whether there was any error in respect of the documents at pages 74-77, no basis has been established for the purposes of the leave to appeal application. The sole purpose of having addressed the issue in this judgment is limited to drawing attention to it for reconsideration by the District Court.
	
	
	I have concluded that Ground 2 should be dismissed.
	
	
	I have accordingly concluded that, for the reasons set out above, the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed and I would so order.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Hall J.

		28 August 2015",2015-08-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702848,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, A2, KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, have each pleaded not guilty to charges, including allegations of female genital mutilation (“FGM”) contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm under s.59 of that Act.
	
	
	A number of pretrial applications were identified and the Court has been in the process of hearing and determining those applications. The parties formed the view that a particular issue was of significance to the proceedings generally and requested that it be dealt with as a matter of priority. The Court acceded to this request.
	


The Present Issue


	
	This issue concerns the directions to be given to the jury, in the circumstances of the present case, concerning the meaning of certain words in s.45 Crimes Act 1900. In particular, attention was focused upon the meaning of the words “otherwise mutilates” in s.45(1).
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, the Court was satisfied that it was appropriate to deal with this topic as a pretrial issue. In doing so, the Court is not considering an application for the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay based upon a claim that the charges are foredoomed to fail: Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119; 80 NSWLR 486 at 490 [15]-[19]. Nor is the Court engaging in a process of fact finding in advance of the trial or seeking to determine whether the Crown has a case that should be left to a jury: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 212, 214-215.
	
	
	Rather, the Court is construing relevant words in s.45, a legal function, with some reference to evidence to be adduced in the trial to provide some context, meaning and understanding to the elements of the s.45 offence in this case. This is being done to aid the formulation of directions to be given to a jury concerning the elements of the offence.
	
	
	I will refer to the charges and allegations against the Accused persons as contained in the Crown Case Statement (“CCS”) before moving to the terms of s.45, the submissions made concerning its proper construction and my decision on the construction questions and proposed directions to be given to a jury at the trial of the Accused persons.

A Short Introduction to Relevant Persons and Events Drawn from the CCS


	
	The Accused in this matter are:
	



	
	A2, the mother of C1 and C2;
	
	
	KM, a retired midwife who, on the Crown case, conducted the FGM procedures; and
	
	
	Mr Vaziri, the highest Dawoodi Bohra (sometimes described as Daudi Bohra) authority in Sydney, who preaches and teaches at a mosque at Auburn.
	



	
	The Accused are members of the Dawoodi Bohra community. The Dawoodi Bohra community is a world-wide subsect of Shia Islam. “Khatna” is a term used within the community to describe circumcision.
	
	
	On 19 July 2012, a report was received by the Department of Family and Community Services stating that a procedure amounting to FGM had been performed on a child in the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	Thereafter, an investigation was undertaken in which C1 and C2 were spoken to in recorded interviews.
	
	
	C1 was born on 19 October 2003. It is the Crown case that FGM was performed upon C1 between October 2009 and August 2012.
	
	
	C2 was born on 26 October 2005. It is the Crown case that FGM was performed upon C2 between January 2012 and August 2012.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that A2 was present during the FGM procedure conducted by KM on each of the girls, and that she encouraged KM to perform the FGM procedures. The Crown contends that A2 is liable for the FGM procedure conducted on her daughters as she was an accessory before the fact, a principal in the second degree and a party to a joint criminal enterprise with KM.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that KM performed the FGM procedure on each of the girls and is a principal in the first degree.
	
	
	The Crown contends that Mr Vaziri encouraged witnesses to lie in their police interviews and encouraged members of the community to tell Police that they did not believe in or practise female circumcision. On the Crown case, such actions were performed, directly or indirectly, to assist A2 and KM in avoiding police detection. As such, the Crown contends that Mr Vaziri was an accessory after the fact to the offences of A2 and KM.
	


An Extended Account of the Crown Case Against the Accused Persons


	
	It is appropriate to set out, in some detail, the case against the Accused persons, drawn principally from the CCS. This will serve to place the Crown allegations in context. Some reference will also be made to proposed medical evidence. Counsel referred to aspects of this proposed evidence in submissions made on the present statutory construction issue.
	
	
	The CCS recites the circumstances in which an investigation of the Accused persons commenced in July 2012 and steps taken to progress the investigation, including interviews and the use of surveillance device warrants and telephone interception warrants.
	


Charging of the Accused Persons


	
	On 9 September 2012, A2 participated in interviews with Police and was charged with offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, KM was charged with two counts under s.45 Crimes Act 1900. She exercised her right to silence and did not participate in an interview.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, Mr Vaziri participated in an interview with Police and was charged with two counts of being an accessory after the fact to FGM contrary to s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The CCS recites the interviewing of other persons, some of whom were charged with charges being later withdrawn or discharged at committal proceedings. It is not necessary to refer to these features in this judgment.
	


The Alleged FGM Procedures on C1 and C2


	
	The CCS (paragraphs 16-31) summarises the Crown allegations with respect to the FGM procedures.
	


The Account of C1


	
	On 29 August 2012, C1 (born 19 October 2003) was interviewed at her school by Detective Senior Constable Christine McDonald and a FACS case worker, Alison Wishart. No other person was present during the videotaped interview. C1 was eight years and 10 months old at the time. (A DVD recording of this interview is a pretrial exhibit, Exhibit PTF, as is a transcript of the interview, Exhibit PTA, Tab 4).
	
	
	During her interview, C1 explained her knowledge of the term “Khatna”. She stated that “Khatna” was when “they give you a little cut down there”. She explained that she knew what “Khatna” was “because it’s happened to [her]”, detailing that when she was seven years old, she had her private part cut by an unknown female at her grandmother’s house.
	
	
	C1 recalled being taken into a bedroom and placed on to a bed. She described that, before the procedure took place, she was “nervous” and was told to “imagine a place” she liked. C1 chose to picture herself as a “princess in a garden”.
	
	
	C1 told Police that “it hurt” when her “private part [was] cut”. The CCS indicates that it is unknown whether C1 was anaesthetised during the procedure, however she recalled opening her eyes stating that “because of imagining the garden I felt a bit funny and I felt I was on a bed in the garden with them all around but I shook my head a bit”. She also stated that she “felt happy because it was over”.
	
	
	C1 also stated that whilst this procedure occurred there were a number of women, including her mother, A2, A5 (her paternal grandmother), A3 (her paternal grandaunt) and another unknown female surrounding her to “calm [her] down”. On the Crown case, the unknown female was KM.
	
	
	Following the procedure, C1 recalled being told to drink lots of water and being handed a glass of lemonade before being taken to have a shower. She remembered being “scared” of the shower, as she thought it was going to hurt.
	
	
	During her interview, C1 also provided Police with information regarding the procedure being conducted on her younger sister, C2. She stated that the last time she saw the person who performed the procedure on her was “when she had to do that thing to my sister”.
	
	
	When questioned further about C2’s procedure, C1 believed it had occurred “some time this year” (2012). She stated that she had travelled to Auburn with her mother and her sisters where they met the unknown woman who had previously performed the procedure on her. C1 then had to travel with the unknown woman, directing her back to the family home in Baulkham Hills.
	
	
	C1 recalled watching a movie downstairs in her home with C2, and a male child who accompanied the unknown lady (said to be the grandson of KM). Whilst they were watching the movie, A2 called out for C2 to come upstairs. C1 then saw C2 go upstairs, where she believes she was with the unknown female, her mother and A4 (her paternal aunt).
	
	
	I have overruled an objection by C1 to giving evidence against her mother, A2, under s.18 Evidence Act 1995. Accordingly, the evidence of C1 will be before a jury at the forthcoming trial.
	


The Account of C2


	
	C2 (born 26 October 2005) was also interviewed at her school by Detective Senior Constable McDonald and Ms Wishart on 29 August 2012. She was six years and 10 months old at that time. (A DVD recording of this interview is a pretrial exhibit, Exhibit PTB, as is a transcript of the interview, Exhibit PTA, Tab 5).
	
	
	During her interview, C2 indicated that a procedure was conducted on her, in her parents’ room, in her home in Baulkham Hills. She recalled lying down on a white cushion and stated that she “felt hurting in her bottom”.
	
	
	C2 could not particularise who was in the room at the time the procedure took place. She also could not state who conducted the procedure, only saying that it was “a woman”.
	
	
	After the procedure, C2 recalls speaking to her father, A1, who told her “it’s OK”. C2 also believed she spoke to her sister about the procedure, but she could not recall what was said.
	
	
	I have held that C2 is competent to give sworn evidence and have overruled an objection by C2 to giving evidence against her mother, A2, under s.18 Evidence Act 1995. Accordingly, the evidence of C2 will be before a jury at the forthcoming trial.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that C2’s FGM procedure took place during the July 2012 winter school holidays. During this time, call charge records show that A2 contacted KM seven times between 26 June and 18 July 2012.
	


Medical Examination of C1 and C2 by Dr Susan Marks


	
	On 3 September 2012, C1 and C2 were examined by Dr Susan Marks from the Child Protection Unit at Westmead Children’s Hospital. Dr Marks was unable to confirm or deny whether the girls had been circumcised. She has reported that she cannot exclude that a Type 1 or Type 4 FGM procedure (under the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) guidelines) (see [204] below) had been conducted, as she could not visualise the head of the clitoris on either child.
	
	
	Dr Marks asserts that if there had been a small cut to the head of the clitoris, it would have been painful at the time, but would have healed in three to five days. Dr Marks also confirmed that any cut or nick to the clitoris would include, at the very minimum, the removal of skin cells.
	
	
	In reports prepared for these proceedings (part Exhibit PTJ), Dr Marks said that the procedures said to have been carried out on C1 and C2 could have included:
	



	
	a cut or nick to any part of the clitoris, including the clitoral hood (prepuce), clitoral head (glans), including pricking or piercing, and/or
	
	
	the removal of part of the clitoral head (glans).
	



	
	According to the CCS (paragraph 31), a cultural expert and member of the Dawoodi Bohra community, states that “the practice of Khatna [within the Dawoodi Bohra community] is a small cut to the tip of the clitoris and the chances of scarring would be slim”. She asserts that it is only when Dawoodi Bohra women get older that they start to realise the problems “regarding the sensitivity and hyper sensitivity” caused by their circumcision. The admissibility of the evidence of this witness is presently under challenge.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by A2 in Recorded Conversations and Police Investigation (CCS, paragraphs 32-48)


	
	At 2.18 pm on 29 August 2012, Ms Wishart advised A2 via telephone that C1 and C2 had been interviewed. At that time, Ms Wishart arranged for A1 and A2 to attend the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad at 4.30 pm that day for a voluntary interview with herself and Detective Senior Constable McDonald.
	
	
	When A2 collected C1 and C2 from school on 29 August 2012, she spoke to the children about their interviews. When C1 explained what she told the Police, A2 responded ""yes ok. You told them everything.  I told you not to say, any one. I told you not to say. Now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you my child this is a big secret, never tell anyone"". This conversation was recorded by the surveillance device issued under the Surveillance Devices Act 2008 that had been placed in the vehicle being driven by A2 at that time.
	
	
	Later on in the afternoon, another conversation took place between A1, A2, C1 and C2 whilst the family were travelling in a different vehicle. During this conversation (also recorded under warrant), A1 tried to convince C1 that she had not been “cut” to which C1 responded “yes, once they asked for scissors … I saw scissors … they do something with scissors'? She asked me don't we do with scissors … do not we do with scissors with something?”.
	
	
	After dropping C1 and C2 with a carer, A1 and A2 drove to the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad. Whilst they were still in the vehicle on their way to the interview, A1 told A2, “we can say that, yes we called this lady for check up to make sure that they haven't had anything done. Say this way, that we called to check them if anything is being done, because they go to Africa and is been done there.  We go to India and Africa and we always do up there. … When they came for check up, we called all the family members and she knows that lady as she is nurse. She is used to, and we normally the ladies don't check children as it is not our subject the children …”.
	
	
	Once at the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad, A1 and A2 were interviewed separately by Detective Senior Constable McDonald and Ms Wishart. The interviews were not electronically recorded, rather contemporaneous notes were made by Detective Senior Constable McDonald. No one else was present during either interview
	
	
	Whilst A1 was being interviewed, A2 contacted her mother by telephone, alerting her of the situation with the Police. The conversation was recorded by way of telephone interception warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). Whilst talking to her mother, A2 stated, ""Our daughters circum-, circumcision, circumcised, don’t we. About that, to us do you see, how now become a government matter over here, yes"" and “Caused to perform for our daughter, didn’t? For the seven even years old!"".
	
	
	All references hereafter to conversations relate to conversations recorded by way of telephone interception warrant or surveillance device warrant. I note that recorded conversations are said to have involved the use of a mixture of languages, including Gujarati and English.
	
	
	When A1’s interview was finished, he returned to the waiting room and had a conversation with A2. During this conversation, A1 again discussed with A2 what she should and should not say to the Police, stating, ""Do not tell them we got information that [C1] and [C2]’s circumcision have been done here"" and, ""If they ask you, tell them, you do not know what happened in it"".  He enquired whether C1’s procedure took place “last year” and told A2 to tell Police that his mother had told them to have the girls circumcised but they refused. A1 also asked, “in us do they cut the skin … or do they cut the whole clitoris?”. To which A2 responded “No … they just do a little bit … just little”.
	
	
	When A2 was interviewed by Police, she indicated that she was aware that the practice of FGM was illegal in Australia, and that she was aware that some of her friends and family had had the procedure performed upon them in Africa. She explained the different types of FGM and detailed that, in the Dawoodi Bohra community, the practice is only for a “bit of skin [to be] removed”. She stated that she had discussed the practice with her daughters whilst they were holidaying in Africa in 2012, but stated that she did not want her daughters circumcised. When A2 was asked the reason why her daughters would say they have been cut on their private parts, she stated, “I think it’s just the checking that they are getting confused” and that “[we] got them checked at different times by [KM]”.'
	
	
	A2 indicated that C1 was examined around the first term school holidays in April 2012 and C2 during the winter school holidays in July 2012. She said that C1 was examined by a female person known as “[KM]” at their family home in Baulkham Hills. She stated that A4 and A5 were also present during the examination. A2 stated that when C2 was examined, the persons present were believed to be A3, A5 and A6. A2 also indicated that during an examination, the underpants are removed and it is “just having a check down there to make sure everything is ok down there”. A2 recalled that KM said, ""everything's alright"", which made her believe her daughters had not been circumcised.
	
	
	After their interview on 29 August 2012, A2 telephoned KM. KM had been made aware of the police investigation earlier in the day by A1. During the conversation, A2 told KM that C1 explained everything to Police - that she had been circumcised and that her procedure had occurred in Australia. She stated that C2 did not know anything about her procedure. A2 also stated that she told Police that if the children had been circumcised, the procedure would have occurred in Africa. The two women then discussed how the Police found out that C1 and C2 had been circumcised, speculating that someone from within the community must have told them.
	
	
	Following her conversation with KM, A2 called her mother and they discussed what was told to Police. A2 stated she told Police the procedure could have taken place in Africa, when C1 and C2 were with their grandparents. She also explained that the Police went to C1 and C2’s school and ""[C1] in fact told everything"". Upon hearing this, A2’s mother stated, “Had you not taught [C1] … Had you not taught [C1] in order that would not speak?"" and A2 responded ""had taught, but these people of ours, those people, in fact are trained, wouldn’t be, in the matter causing the information to be taken out from all”.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, A2 telephoned A3 and explained the police investigation. During the conversation, A2 stated ""We got [C1], [C2] circumcised didn't we … first time happened at yours and the second time was here only. Named mummy, … and all”. She also informed A3 of the story she must tell if questioned by the Police explaining, ""if any questions arise at all, you are just to say that 'yes, we were there ... it did happen, but just checking occurred'. And I haven't said yours that it happened at your house; I said that you were at our house and happened in this year. Now, I slightly, that is a little untrue story, now, knowledge, whether I will later clarify or not, with that one”.
	
	
	On the same morning, A2 had another conversation with both C1 and C2 whilst they were driving in the Toyota motor vehicle. During the conversation, she tried to find out how the Police knew what had happened, stating, ""we just want to know, that how they came to know about it. We are just checking that you haven't said it by mistake to any friend or teacher”.
	
	
	After the conversation referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, A2 telephoned A1. During the conversation, A2 stated C1 told Police that, ""We performed it in Wollongong” and that she has phoned A3 to inform her of the investigation. She explained that she told A3 that they have to ""save Aunty [KM]"" and that she is only to tell Police ""[KM] has just checked everything … if anything would have happened, it has happened in Africa”. The couple also discussed that they did not tell Police that anything occurred at A3’s home. They agreed that they would eventually have to tell the Police an examination occurred at A3’s home because C1 had already told them that. A2 also stated, ""If we all will remain together, those people do not have an evidence of any kind to incriminate”.
	
	
	On 4 September 2012, the day after C1 and C2 were examined medically by Dr Marks, A2 received a telephone call from KM. It is apparent from the conversation that the women believed that the examination of C1 and C2 by Dr Marks went well (the results of this examination are mentioned at [42]-[43] above). KM stated to A2, ""then it is good that, because I had the knowledge that those people would not be able to see anything [during the examination]”. A2 explained that the case was not closed and there would be an ongoing investigation by the Police and FACS separately, however she believed that without any physical evidence, the Police would not be able to take the matter further. At the end of the conversation, KM told A2, ""Especially now do explain to [C1] that if they ask anything all … in the school … .just to say as this that, ’I do not have the knowledge, call my mother, the matter is finished'”.
	
	
	During this conversation, A2 and KM also speculated about how the Police could have found out about the procedures. KM suggested A4 told someone stating, “[A7] tells me 'mummy' ummm [A4] is certainly quite friendly with everything in the mosque ... perhaps ... she could have uttered by mistake because [she] trusts everyone instantly, all her friends ... She is not of a type who would speak... although she was there’”.
	
	
	On 7 September 2012, A2 was arrested and charged with two counts of FGM. At the police station, A2 participated in an ERISP during which she stated that she had a very limited knowledge of FGM, as she had only heard about the topic in newspapers and during conversations with her friends and family who had had the procedure performed on them in Africa. A2 asserted her belief that C1 and C2 had not been circumcised, and reiterated that they must have become confused with the examination conducted on them by KM. She detailed that C1’s examination occurred “a couple years back” after a previous trip to Africa in 2008. C1’s examination was said to have occurred at A3’s house and C2’s at her own house. A2 stated that she had had C1 and C2 examined because, at their age, there was a risk of them having been circumcised when they were Africa. A2 did not adopt what she had previously stated in her interview on 29 August 2012 in respect of the “Khatna” procedure.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by KM in Recorded Conversations and Police Investigations (CCS, paragraphs 49-59)


	
	At 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012, KM received a telephone call from A1, informing her that C1 and C2 had informed the Police about “Khatna”. KM became concerned that her name had been given to Police and asked if they could just tell Police that she only checked the children and “that was it”, commenting “there is no scar or anything there”. A1 confirmed that they would tell Police that C1 and C2 were examined in case they had been circumcised in Africa.
	
	
	At 4.08 pm on the same day, KM contacted a Dawoodi Bohra Sheikh, Elder Jaffar. During this conversation, she stated, ""Over here, we, urn, I am quite in trouble and urn I do not have the information if the Elder Brother, The Elder Brother Khusar has told you anything or not because I do not want to go to gaol at my age. Now, please ask the Elder Brother, what does here, because this umm, in fact, I, with the Lord's permission, used to pay attention to the age of seven years of the female children. Now, this one girl has spoken something to someone in the school. Now, then, have called that one's parents to the Police. Then the girl's parents will give my name; I don't have the knowledge if the girl has given my name"".  She repeated this sentiment again during the conversation when she stated ""I, with the Lords' consent, I, for many years, used to pay attention to a seven year old girl. You understand what I say, don't you?"".
	
	
	At 5.50 pm, KM received a telephone call from A2, informing her how the interview with Police went. During the conversation, KM questioned whether C1 told Police ""that it was done to her”, and A2 responded “yes”. KM informed A2 of the conversation she had with Elder Jaffar, explaining her belief that “this matter is of our community”. She also stated that she is “suddenly worried now"" and too old to have to sit in gaol.
	
	
	Between 7.35 pm and 8.28 pm, KM had a number of telephone conversations with her husband, PM, and her daughter, A7. During these conversations, KM explained that the Police were investigating the circumcision of C1 and C2. She stated that someone had made a complaint about her and that the Police must have a solid tip or they would not have interviewed the children. KM also explained that this was the first that her husband would have heard of the situation.
	
	
	At 8.48 pm, KM and A7 had another conversation. During this conversation, A7 stated “I think whoever has done a report, it's; I mean, either it's been done against them [the As] or against you. But if it was against you then you've got to ask yourself that ‘wouldn't they have not [done] it some time ago?’ because you know; obviously; it's not; it's not the first time what you have done”.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, KM was contacted by Mr Vaziri. Mr Vaziri stated that “35,000” had been sanctioned for her, and that she must complete a form to send to London in order to receive a cheque. During this conversation, KM stated that she was really scared, so scared in fact that she rang Elder Jaffar and told him that she did not want to go to gaol.
	
	
	After the medical examination of C1 and C2 on 3 September 2012, KM had a conversation with A7 and PM. During this conversation, the following exchange took place between the two women:
	


KM stated:   “She said that everything is well, for both of them [C1 and C2]”.

A7 stated: “Yeah, thank goodness ... now mum, don't do this again”.

KM stated: “No, No, I am not going to do anything now”.

A7 stated: “Yeah, now just refused, if anyone asks. Just say ‘Now my hands are not good, and'”

KM stated: “Yes, I was telling these people also the same thing that ‘I shake a lot; my hands and I won't do it’. But they said ‘no please do it'. Anyway, whatever happened has happened. That's it, I am not going to do it now … now you see, those people will keep a perfectly close on this because they have warned them”.


	
	On 4 September 2012, KM telephoned A2. KM stated to A2, “Then it is good that, because I had the knowledge that those people would not be able to see anything [during the examination]"". At the end of the conversation, KM told A2, “Especially now do explain to [C1] that if they ask anything all … in the school just to say as this that, ‘I do not have the knowledge, call my mother’ the matter is finished”. KM also speculated that A4 “could have uttered by mistake because [she] trusts everyone instantly all her friends … she is not of a type who would speak … although she was there”.
	
	
	On 10 September 2012, KM was contacted by A1 who informed her that the Police were attending the homes of community members, giving them pamphlets and asking them questions about female circumcision. A1 repeated the story that must be told to Police stating that everyone has been informed to say “no comment” if they are asked about the day of the procedure, and that KM only came to check C1 and C2. When KM was asked what she will say about using an instrument during the examination, she stated, “I will just say - that there was nothing my hand. Certainly, by no means I would just [do] something [to] all with the hand, hmmm, do that in this way to the lower [part] of someone else's daughter? Indeed, I look hmm, examined to a little extent by opening the cervix just in this way with the forceps”.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, KM was arrested by Police. At the police station, she did not wish to participate in an interview.
	
	
	At 2.53 pm on 13 September 2012, KM telephoned A1 and informed him of her arrest. KM told A1 that she did not tell Police anything and wanted to confirm everyone “maintained one story only …that you invited me merely to examine”.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by Mr Vaziri in Recorded Conversations and Police Investigations (CCS, paragraphs 60-71)


	
	At 3.04 pm on 29 August 2012, A1 telephoned Mr Vaziri, informing him that C1 and C2 had told the Police about Khatna. A1 told Mr Vaziri, “Now it seem [C1] has already told them everything circumcisions-kharanat has happened”. He also stated that the Police had requested an interview with both himself and A2. When asked by A1, Mr Vaziri agreed that the practice of Khatna was illegal in Australia. A1 asked Mr Vaziri what to tell the Police. Mr Vaziri stated, ""This is my thought. Tell that ‘In fact, we had gone in Milad and we had left at our neighbours, who, who has traveller’s lodge over here and then do not have the knowledge as to what happened’”.
	
	
	At 6.18 pm on the same day, A1 telephoned Mr Vaziri again, informing him that the Police had been told that any circumcision on C1 and C2 must have taken place in Africa and that a lady was only called to examine the children, to verify that they had not been circumcised. A1 also told Mr Vaziri that female circumcision is illegal in Australia and the Police want to have C1 and C2 examined. Upon hearing this, Mr Vaziri advised A1 to seek legal advice. He also stated, ""Brother only one thing. Always keep providing the same oral testimony that you have said. Then; change in it; don't change it … Don't introduce any change in that nothing at all, not even a little"". During this conversation, A1 also advised that C1's circumcision was performed at A3’s house and C2's circumcision was performed at his own house. A1 also speculated that KM would be very anxious because she was the person who conducted the circumcisions.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, Mr Vaziri telephoned KM. During this call, he informed KM that “35,000” had been sanctioned for her, and that in order to receive a cheque she had to complete a form that would be sent to London. During the conversation, KM informed Mr Vaziri that she was very scared about the police investigation and had telephoned another Elder, telling him that she did not want to go to gaol.
	
	
	On 3 September 2012, Mr Vaziri received a telephone call from Hussein Karimjee, a member of the community and a solicitor assisting the A family. Mr Karimjee informed Mr Vaziri that he had spoken to an Elder in London and that a document was being created to outline the community's attitude to FGM. Mr Karimjee instructed Mr Vaziri to tell Police that the community does not agree with or encourage anyone to conduct FGM in Australia or any other country. Additionally, he recommended that KM no longer perform procedures within the community as she was more than likely being watched by Police. Mr Karimjee also warned that no one from the community should go overseas for the purpose of having their daughters circumcised.
	
	
	During his conversation with Mr Karimjee, Mr Vaziri questioned what he should say “according to Sharia”. Mr Karimjee stated that mutilation and circumcision are not written anywhere and it is not encouraged within the community. He reasoned that the procedure performed within the community is so minimal that it cannot be seen as mutilation. Mr Karimjee stated that without further evidence no one would believe the words of an eight-year old, however he also warned that the investigation is continuing and the people within the community needed to be cautious and alert as to what they should and should not tell Police.
	
	
	On 6 September 2012, Mr Karimjee again telephoned Mr Vaziri and the two discussed Mr Vaziri's upcoming interview with Police. Mr Vaziri stated he had been advised by another Elder to be confident in the interview. Mr Karimjee told Mr Vaziri that he should say, as far as he was aware, C1 and C2 were very quiet after they returned from Africa, so KM was engaged to verify that they had not been circumcised. Mr Karimjee informed Mr Vaziri that C1 had already advised Police that many people came to Wollongong when her procedure took place, that scissors were used and that she was in pain for two-to-three days after the procedure. Additionally, Mr Karimjee stated that the medical examination “did not show anything” and therefore Police had no evidence of a procedure taking place. At the end of the conversation, Mr Vaziri asked Mr Karimjee if there were any difficulties in him representing everyone involved, to which Mr Karimjee responded there would be no problem so long as everyone told the same story.
	
	
	At 6.09 pm on 10 September 2012, Mr Vaziri telephoned an unknown female member of the Dawoodi Bohra community. During this phone call, Mr Vaziri advised the unknown female that the Police are going to the houses of community members and asking them questions about female circumcision. The unknown female stated that Police had already been to her house, but she told Police that she did not know the meaning of the work ""khatna"" and had no idea whether young girls were being circumcised. Mr Vaziri told the unknown female that, if the Police return and ask any further questions, she is to say ""I am not saying … mean we do not do it”.
	
	
	At 6.42 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned a male Dawoodi Bohra community member known as A8. Similarly to the previous call, Mr Vaziri warned A8 that Police are going to the homes of community members and asking them questions about female circumcision. During the conversation, Mr Vaziri told A8, ""If someone asking you or your wife this should your answer; 'We do not believe in it’”. Mr Vaziri told A8 to relay the message to his wife whilst he was still on the phone stating the Police ""are leaving soon for information"". Mr Vaziri also stated, ""Which ever country you live, loyal to that country. That what should do”.
	
	
	At 8.57 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned Mr Karimjee. During this conversation, the two again discussed what Mr Vaziri would tell Police in his interview. Mr Karimjee reiterated that Mr Vaziri was to say he does not teach or believe in female circumcision, warning that Mr Vaziri must repeat the phrase exactly to Police. Mr Vaziri informed Mr Karimjee that the Police had gone to the houses of the community members and handed out pamphlets. He also raised concerns that the Police had found the community website.
	
	
	At 9.50 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned Mr Karimjee again. During this conversation Mr Vaziri raised concerns that there was no control over the situation. Mr Karimjee told Mr Vaziri there is no reason to worry, stating, ""What knowledge do those people have as to Your Honour's plan ... they do not have information as to what Your Honour's plan was"". Mr Karimjee repeated his warning that the community will have to take care now, to which Mr Vaziri responded, ""Yes exactly, in fact these people also have the information"".
	
	
	At 5.20 am on 13 September 2012, police officers attached to the investigation attended the Auburn Mosque and arrested Mr Vaziri. Mr Vaziri was conveyed to Auburn Police Station where he participated in a recorded interview. During the interview, Mr Vaziri stated that he had never heard of FGM, female circumcision or “Khatna” being performed on females. When Mr Vaziri was advised that the [As] had been charged the week prior with committing FGM on their children, he stated they had approached him after being arrested in order to obtain a “blessing” from the 52nd Dai Mutlaq (the highest living Dawoodi Bohra authority, who is based in India). Mr Vaziri then conceded this meant he had heard of FGM prior to walking into the interview room, but this conversation with the As] was, in fact, the first time he had heard of it.
	
	
	Later in his police interview, Mr Vaziri stated the first time he had heard of FGM was 4 days prior when he was handed a pamphlet about it at the mosque. He stated he was completely against FGM and that if he ever found out about it happening in his community, he would report it to Police. Mr Vaziri further stated he never provided advice to the [As], he simply conveyed their request for a blessing to the 52nd Dai Mutlaq. He also stated he is the highest Dawoodi Bohra authority in Sydney, but is not in a position to authorise any ritual involving FGM and explained that the Quran dictates that Muslims must abide by the laws of the land they are living in. When asked if he was aware FGM is illegal in New South Wales, he stated he did not need to know because it had never been an issue for him. He also stated he did not know if the practice was illegal in India and again, had never needed to because he had never even come across it.
	


The Real Issues in the Trial


	
	To place the present statutory construction issue into context, it is helpful to note what appear to be the real issues in the trial.
	
	
	The issues in dispute were touched upon during the pretrial hearing concerning the competence and compellability of C1 and C2. During submissions, I enquired of Mr Sutherland SC, counsel for A2 and Mr Vaziri (PT49-51) (emphasis added):
	


“HIS HONOUR: The next thing I wanted to raise was an issue arising from the submissions. In the Crown written submissions at para 15 the Crown foreshadowed what the defence case with respect to A2 and KM may be, concerning [C2]. The defence written submissions at paras 6 and 7 - 6 in particular - indicated what the issues at trial will include. Is there an issue in the trial and this is directed to Mr Sutherland and Mr Bouveng what is in issue at trial with respect to the Crown allegation with respect to [C2]? I'm looking at paras 6 and 7 to assist me to understand that. 

SUTHERLAND: Your Honour, the Crown submission flows from a discussion in one of the intercepted calls. The fundamental issue at trial will be the proposition that whatever took place involved no damage, injury or other physical intervention falling within the relevant statutory definition. 

HIS HONOUR: But is there an issue that something took place? 

SUTHERLAND: No. 

HIS HONOUR: I'm conscious that the cascading issues which I'm looking at here and will occupy some time relate to the accounts of [C2] and [C1], and the Crown seek to adduce evidence in one way or another of what each of the children said happened at a particular time in a room. 

SUTHERLAND: Indeed, yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there going to be any dispute that each child on separate occasions was in the room with certain people? 

SUTHERLAND: No. 

HIS HONOUR: And that some contact was made with their body? 

SUTHERLAND: No, there will not be a dispute about that, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: What is the dispute then with respect to [C2], firstly? 

SUTHERLAND: What it was that was done. 

HIS HONOUR: And with [C1]? 

SUTHERLAND: The same. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there any issue that A2 was present at the time on each occasion? 

SUTHERLAND: I don't believe so, your Honour. The short answer is no. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think it's the Crown case that Mr Vaziri was said to have been present. Is that so?

SUTHERLAND: Correct, your Honour. He's charged as an accessory after the fact.

HIS HONOUR: As an accessory, yes.

SUTHERLAND: I think it can fairly be said not that we want to run off on this tangent at the moment but I think it can fairly be said that the substance of the allegation against him relates to conversations between him and a now Crown witness, an uncharged person, charged previously but discharged at committal, namely, [A1] himself. 

HIS HONOUR: That's the father?

SUTHERLAND: Father. 

HIS HONOUR: of [C2] and [C1]. 

SUTHERLAND: And [C1], yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. 

SUTHERLAND: Mr Bouveng can speak for himself, but in relation to his client, the issues, I expect, are what is it that happened. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Well, I might just ask Mr Bouveng. Your client is alleged by the Crown to have been present and to have been the person who undertook the acts in question, I think. That's the Crown case, isn't it, against your client? 

BOUVENG: It is. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there any issue that your client was present on these occasions? 

BOUVENG: There isn't. 

HIS HONOUR: What is in issue then with respect to your client and the allegation of [C2]? 

BOUVENG: Precisely what Mr Sutherland just indicated on behalf of A2, that is, what is it that was done on those two occasions with [C2] and [C1], and whether or not what was done amounts to the act as raised under s 45 and s 59. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right. That assists me just to have an understanding. I know that we're at an early stage but it will assist me to have that understanding.” 


	
	The Notice of Defence Response under s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, served on behalf of A2 and dated 29 June 2015, stated the nature of her defence in the following way:
	


“The nature of the accused person’s A2s defence is that she did not commit any of the offences. Specifically, A2 did not act in a criminal enterprise with KM who did not excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of the complainants, nor did KM assault either of the complainants occasioning actual bodily harm.”


	
	The Notice stated that A2 proposes to give consent under s.184 Evidence Act 1995 admitting the following matters of fact:
	


“*   That she was present when KM undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C1] at her request; and

*   That she was present when KM undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C2] at her request.”


	
	The Notice of Defence Response dated 29 June 2015 on behalf of KM is to a similar effect. KM’s defence is described in the following way:
	


“The nature of the accused person KM’s defence is that she did not commit any of the offences. Specifically, KM did not excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of the complainants, nor did she assault either of the complainants occasioning actual bodily harm.”


	
	KM’s Notice of Defence Response foreshadowed the following admissions:
	


“*   That she undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C1] at the request of A2; and

*   That she undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C2] at the request of A2.”


	
	The Notice of Defence Response for each Accused person notified, for the purposes of s.143(1)(d) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the following point of law which was intended to be raised:
	


“What injury constitutes the legal definition of ‘mutilation’ under s.45, as particularised in the latest indictment filed by the Crown”.


	
	The present judgment addresses that point of law, for the purpose identified at the commencement of the judgment (at [3]-[5]).
	
	
	The Notice of Defence Response dated 29 June 2015 for Mr Vaziri includes a denial that he committed the offences and an indication that he does not propose to give any notice of consent under s.184 Evidence Act 1995.
	


Provisions in the Crimes Act 1900 Concerning the Prohibition of FGM

Enactment of s.45 in 1994


	
	Section 45 Crimes Act 1900 was enacted in 1994 by way of the Crimes (Female General Mutilation) Amendment Act 1994 (“the 1994 FGM Act”).
	
	
	The 1994 FGM Act inserted s.45 in Division 6 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900. Part 3 is entitled “Offences Against the Person” and Division 6 of Part 3 is entitled “Acts Causing Danger to Life or Bodily Harm”.
	
	
	The long title of the 1994 FGM Act was “an Act to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to prohibit female genital mutilation”.
	
	
	Section 45, as it stood at relevant times (for the purpose of these proceedings) between 2009 and 2012, was in the following terms:
	


“45    Prohibition of female genital mutilation

(1)    A person who:

(a)    excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person, or

(b)    aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to perform any of those acts on another person,

is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(2)    An offence is committed against this section even if one or more of the acts constituting the offence occurred outside New South Wales if the person mutilated by or because of the acts is ordinarily resident in the State.

(3)    It is not an offence against this section to perform a surgical operation if that operation:

(a)    is necessary for the health of the person on whom it is performed and is performed by a medical practitioner, or

(b)    is performed on a person in labour or who has just given birth, and for medical purposes connected with that labour or birth, by a medical practitioner or authorised professional, or

(c)    is a sexual reassignment procedure and is performed by a medical practitioner.

(4)    In determining whether an operation is necessary for the health of a person only matters relevant to the medical welfare of the person are to be taken into account.

(5)    It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the person mutilated by or because of the acts alleged to have been committed consented to the acts.

(6)    This section applies only to acts occurring after the commencement of the section.

(7)    In this section:

authorised professional means:

(a)    a registered midwife, or

(b)    a midwifery student, or

(c)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person authorised to practise midwifery by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the functions of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, or

(d)    a medical student.

medical practitioner, in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia, includes a person authorised to practise medicine by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the Medical Board of Australia.

medical student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the medical profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a medical practitioner in that place.

midwifery student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the nursing and midwifery profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a midwife practitioner in that place.

sexual reassignment procedure means a surgical procedure to alter the genital appearance of a person to the appearance (as nearly as practicable) of the opposite sex to the sex of the person.”


	
	Reference will be made later in this judgment to the Explanatory Memorandum and parts of the Second Reading Debate, together with other extrinsic material upon which the parties relied on the hearing of this issue.
	
	
	The 1994 FGM Act commenced on 1 May 1995.
	
	
	It should be noted that:
	



	
	the 1994 FGM Act did not purport to define FGM beyond the terms used in the section itself, in particular s.45(1)(a);
	
	
	s.45 is not age specific in that it is not directed solely to performance of a prohibited procedure upon a child or young person.
	


Amendment of s.45 in 2014 and the Enactment of s.45A


	
	Although not directly applicable to these proceedings, it is appropriate to refer to amendments effected by the Crimes Amendment (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2014 (“the 2014 FGM Amendment Act”). Given the relationship between the 1994 and 2014 legislation, the proper construction of the term “mutilates” in s.45(1)(a) will be assisted by an examination of the changes made by the 2014 FGM Amendment Act, and extrinsic material relevant to that legislation.
	
	
	The 2014 FGM Amendment Act amended s.45 and inserted s.45A into the Act. The amendment of s.45 and the enactment of a closely related provision, s.45A, will bear upon the proper construction of the terms FGM and “mutilates” in s.45. It is appropriate to set out in full the current provisions of s.45 and s.45A:
	


“45    Prohibition of female genital mutilation

(1)    A person who:

(a)    excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person, or

(b)    aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to perform any of those acts on another person,

      is liable to imprisonment for 21 years.

(2)    (Repealed)

(3)    It is not an offence against this section to perform a surgical operation if that operation:

(a)    is necessary for the health of the person on whom it is performed and is performed by a medical practitioner, or

(b)    is performed on a person in labour or who has just given birth, and for medical purposes connected with that labour or birth, by a medical practitioner or authorised professional, or

(c)    is a sexual reassignment procedure and is performed by a medical practitioner.

(4)    In determining whether an operation is necessary for the health of a person only matters relevant to the medical welfare of the person are to be taken into account.

(5)    It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the person mutilated by or because of the acts alleged to have been committed consented to the acts.

(6)    `This section applies only to acts occurring after the commencement of the section.

(7)    In this section:

authorised professional means:

(a)    a registered midwife, or

(b)    a midwifery student, or

(c)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person authorised to practise midwifery by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the functions of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, or

(d)    a medical student.

medical practitioner, in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia, includes a person authorised to practise medicine by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the Medical Board of Australia.

medical student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the medical profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a medical practitioner in that place.

midwifery student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the nursing and midwifery profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a midwife practitioner in that place.

sexual reassignment procedure means a surgical procedure to alter the genital appearance of a person to the appearance (as nearly as practicable) of the opposite sex to the sex of the person.

45A    Removing person from State for female genital mutilation

(1)    A person is guilty of an offence if the person takes another person from the State, or arranges for another person to be taken from the State, with the intention of having female genital mutilation performed on the other person.

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 21 years.

(2)    In proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) and in the absence of proof to the contrary, it is to be presumed that the accused took another person, or arranged for another person to be taken, from the State with the intention of female genital mutilation being performed on the other person if it is proved that:

(a)    the accused took the person, or arranged for the person to be taken, from the State, and

(b)    female genital mutilation was performed on the person while outside the State.

(3)    It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the person taken from the State consented to being so taken.

(4)    In this section:

female genital mutilation means an act referred to in section 45 (1) (a), the performance of which would be an offence against that section if performed in the State.”


	
	As will be noted, s.45 was amended by the removal of s.45(2) and the increase of the maximum penalty from seven years’ imprisonment to 21 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	For the purpose of s.45A, the legislature defined “female genital mutilation” as meaning “an act referred to in section 45(1)(a), the performance of which would be an offence against that section if performed in the State”: s.45(4).
	
	
	In adopting this approach, it appears that the legislature accepted that the term FGM in s.45 had a settled meaning which could be applied, without further elaboration, in the new offence created by s.45A.
	
	
	Accordingly, the construction of s.45(1) under consideration in these proceedings will have equal application to the offence created by s.45A.
	


The Competing Submissions Concerning the Meaning of the word “Mutilates” in s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900


	
	Before embarking upon an examination of the competing submissions and my conclusion concerning the issue of interpretation addressed in this judgment, it is useful to set out the end point submissions of the parties concerning the meaning which should be accorded to the word “mutilates” in the context of this case.
	
	
	The Crown submits that any physical injury to any extent to the female genital organs, which is done for non-medical reasons, can amount to mutilation for the purposes of s.45. The Crown submits that a nick or cut to the genitalia for the purposes of FGM is capable of falling within the concept of mutilation in s.45. The Crown says that, at the very least, the procedure performed by KM on C1 and C2 was a cutting or nicking (including pricking or piercing) of the clitoris so as to be capable of falling within the terms of s.45. The Crown submits that the jury should be directed that any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons falls within the meaning of “mutilation” for the purpose of s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC, for A2 and Mr Vaziri, and Mr Bouveng, for KM, joined in a submission that a jury should be directed that the word “mutilates” in s.45 means to cut off, destroy, or alter radically a part of the body, in the present case (given the terms of the Indictment), the clitoris.
	
	
	The Court had the benefit of detailed written submissions from the Crown (MFI20) and the Accused persons (MFI23) together with oral submissions made on 19 August 2015 by reference to these submissions (PT495-529). Volumes of material relied upon by the parties on the construction issue were provided by the Crown (Exhibit PTP) and the Accused persons (Exhibit PT7). As a result of issues raised in the course of oral submissions, both the Crown and the Accused persons provided supplementary submissions on 20 August 2015 concerning the meaning to be accorded to the word “clitoris”, which appears in s.45(1)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	In what follows, I will provide a short overview of the submissions, followed by my analysis of the issues giving rise to the conclusions reached on the construction issue and the proper directions to be given to a jury.
	


Short Overview of Submissions of the Parties

The Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown invited the Court to construe the term “otherwise mutilates” in s.45(1) in a purposive way, keeping in mind the context in which the words are used.
	
	
	The Crown contended:
	



	
	that an available dictionary meaning of the word “mutilates” is to cause an injury, so that the ordinary meaning of the term is capable of accommodating the Crown submission;
	
	
	even if the ordinary meaning of the word “mutilates” is narrower than this, the Court should accord the term the meaning contended for by the Crown having regard to the purpose or object of the provision (s.33 Interpretation Act 1987) and by reference to available extrinsic material (s.34 Interpretation Act 1987).
	



	
	The Court was taken to the Second Reading Debates surrounding the 1994 FGM Act and material referred to in those debates, including a 1994 report of the Family Law Council to which further reference will be made.
	
	
	Reference was made, as well, to WHO publications concerning FGM, and material relied upon for official community education purposes within New South Wales to explain FGM and to foster its prevention, following the enactment of the 1994 FGM Act.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the term “otherwise mutilates” is a type of catch-all phrase to be understood in the context of FGM generally, as expanded upon in the range of publications and other materials to which the Crown points.
	
	
	It was submitted that an important feature in the construction of the term “mutilates” in this context is that the affected area is the most sensitive and intimate part of the body of (usually) a child, being the genital area.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a finding that mutilation did not extend to any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons, would be contrary to the legislative purpose and would fail to recognise the legislative context and would fail, as well, to provide proper protection for those for whom it was enacted to protect, particularly children who are considered vulnerable.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the purpose of the 1994 FGM Act was to cover the field in terms of FGM and that it was not limited to the most severe forms of that conduct referred to in the extrinsic material.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that acceptance of the construction advanced for the Accused persons would unduly narrow the conduct caught by s.45(1) in a manner which was inconsistent with the purpose or object of the enactment and which would serve to defeat that purpose or object.
	


Submissions of the Accused Persons


	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons that the ordinary meaning of the word “mutilates” should be applied here and that that word involved far more than “any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons” as contended for by the Crown. The Court was taken to various dictionary definitions of the word “mutilate”. It was submitted that the word “mutilates” is a strong one connoting the injuring, disfiguring, depravation, castration, destruction of use, or making an imperfection by permanent or irreparable damage, excision or other act of destruction.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused persons took the Court to other legal dictionary definitions of the word “mutilation” in support of this submission. The Court was taken, as well, to consideration of the word “mutilate” in decisions from the United States of America.
	
	
	The Court was taken to the decision of Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, in In the Matter of B and G (Children) (No. 2) v Leeds City Council and Ors [2015] EWFC 3, where consideration was given to s.1 Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (UK) which is in similar terms to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. It was submitted that this decision provided some support for a narrow construction of the term “mutilates” as contended for by the defence in this case.
	
	
	Counsel took the Court to the use of the word “mutilation” in other statutes in Australia, including s.268.47 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and s.67 Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) in support of the defence submission.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Court should construe a penal provision such as s.45(1) in a literal and non-expansive fashion, with reliance being placed, amongst other cases, upon Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149.
	
	
	It was submitted that the wording of s.45 is clear and does not produce ambiguity, inconsistency or absurdity. It was submitted that a purposive construction did not justify an expansion of the scope of FGM beyond its textual limits. In these circumstances, it was submitted that there was no necessity for consideration of extraneous material although it was further contended that such material supported the defence approach in any event.
	
	
	Counsel relied upon other canons of statutory interpretation, including noscitur a sociis and the ejusdem generis principle. It was submitted that a genus exists here with “excise” and “infibulates” being methods of injury so that “mutilation” needs to follow with the same common characteristic: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Clark [2003] NSWCA 91; 57 NSWLR 113 at 143 [126]. It was submitted that the common characteristic here, giving rise to a genus, was the infliction of serious injury. It was submitted that, when “mutilate” is read in conjunction with the specific words “excise” and “infibulate”, it is confirmed that really serious injury is required to have been caused so as to constitute mutilation.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Second Reading Speech of the Minister with respect to the 1994 FGM Act indicated that the provision was directed to three forms of FGM, being “infibulation, clitoridectomy and sunna”. I will return to these concepts later in the judgment. It was submitted that this statement was contrary to the Crown submission in support of the breadth of the term “mutilates” in s.45.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the Crown construction would apply s.45 to genital cosmetic procedures, such as the insertion of genital studs or rings, where an adult woman requested and consented to such a procedure. In this way, it was submitted that the Crown approach would involve legislative overreach of a type beyond the intention of the legislature in 1994. Such a construction, it was said, would give rise to absurd or unreasonable outcomes, so as to emphasise the error in broad construction advanced by the Crown.
	
	
	A further submission was made by reference to the term “actual bodily harm” in s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900 (the alternative counts) and a contrast between that element and the Crown submission concerning the meaning of “mutilates” in s.45(1) of the Act.
	


Analysis of Matters Bearing Upon the Meaning of “Otherwise Mutilates” in s.45 Crimes Act 1900


	
	What follows involves identification and analysis of matters bearing upon the construction issue in this case. Following this analysis (which involves some conclusions), I will move to summarise my findings and conclusions on the construction issue.
	


Some Principles of Statutory Interpretation


	
	It is appropriate to refer to a number of judicial statements bearing upon the task of statutory interpretation, before moving to the Interpretation Act 1987 and other aspects to be considered in determining the issue.
	
	
	A helpful starting point are the well-known statements in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355, where McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at 381 [69] and 384 [78] (footnotes omitted):
	


“[69]   The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision must be determined ‘by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole’. In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397, Dixon CJ pointed out that ‘the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed’. Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed.

   …

[78]   … the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning.”


	
	Further assistance is provided by the statement of Bathurst CJ (Beazley and Basten JJA agreeing) in Rail Corporation New South Wales v Brown [2012] NSWCA 296; 82 NSWLR 318 at 329 [39]-[40]:
	


“39   As has recently been pointed out by the High Court on a number of occasions, the process of construction begins with the construction of the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words in question, having regard to their context and legislative purpose: Australian Education Union v Department of Education and Children's Services [2012] HCA 3 at [26]; Roadshow Films Pty Limited v iiNet [2012] HCA 16 at [22]; Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [41], [45]-[48].

40   Further, although the legislative purpose in enacting the provision and the mischief to be remedied are factors which are to be taken into account in construing the provision in question (see the cases cited above; CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Interpretation Act 1987 s 33, s 34) it is not for a court to construe its own idea of a desirable policy, impute that to the legislature and then characterise it as a statutory purpose: Australian Education Union supra at [26] and the cases there cited; Alcan supra at [46].”


	
	In Monis v The Queen [2013] HCA 4; 249 CLR 92, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ, in the course of construing a penal provision, said at 202 [309]:
	


“The appellants' approach to the meaning of the word ‘offensive’ in s 471.12 denies the relevance of context. The modern approach to interpretation, particularly in the case of general words, requires that the context be considered in the first instance and not merely later when some ambiguity is said to arise [K & S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon & Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48; (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 315 per Mason J; [1985] HCA 48]. Such an approach was confirmed as correct in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [(1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69]]. Whilst the process of construction concerns language, it is not assisted by a focus upon the clarity of expression of a word to the exclusion of its context.”


	
	In Milne v The Queen, at 164 [38], the Full High Court said with respect to the use of a purposive construction of a penal provision (footnotes omitted):
	


“Section 400.3(1) creates a serious offence. It is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 25 years. In the end the ‘broad construction’ proffered by the respondent seemed to involve little more than the proposition that, however construed, it fits the facts of this case. As a matter of textual analysis, it does not. Purposive construction does not justify expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits. In this case, those limits are not narrowly defined. The language of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii), and its associated definitions, is capable of application to a range of circumstances which fall within their ordinary meanings. Its construction according to the ordinary meaning of its words is sufficient to provide a broad coverage consistent with its purpose and without resort to ‘extended’ meanings of those words.”


	
	These propositions will be kept in mind in undertaking the process of statutory interpretation in this case.
	


Relevant Provisions of the Interpretation Act 1987


	
	The purposive construction rule in this State is reflected in s.33 Interpretation Act 1987, which states:
	


“Regard to be had to purposes or objects of Acts and statutory rules

In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or statutory rule or, in the case of a statutory rule, in the Act under which the rule was made) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.”


	
	Section 34 concerns the use of extrinsic material in statutory interpretation. The provision will be mentioned for a number of purposes in this judgment. The section provides:
	


“34    Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of Acts and statutory rules

(1)    In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, if any material not forming part of the Act or statutory rule is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:

(a)    to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made), or

(b)    to determine the meaning of the provision:

(i)    if the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or

(ii)    if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

(2)    Without limiting the effect of subsection (1), the material that may be considered in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, or a statutory rule made under the Act, includes:

(a)    all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer,

(b)    any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission, committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid before either House of Parliament before the provision was enacted or made,

(c) any relevant report of a committee of Parliament or of either House of Parliament before the provision was enacted or made,

(d)    any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the Act,

(e)    any explanatory note or memorandum relating to the Bill for the Act, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of Parliament by a Minister or other member of Parliament introducing the Bill before the provision was enacted or made,

(f)    the speech made to a House of Parliament by a Minister or other member of Parliament on the occasion of the moving by that Minister or member of a motion that the Bill for the Act be read a second time in that House,

(g)    any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes of this section, and

(h)    any relevant material in the Minutes of Proceedings or the Votes and Proceedings of either House of Parliament or in any official record of debates in Parliament or either House of Parliament.

(3)    In determining whether consideration should be given to any material, or in considering the weight to be given to any material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to:

(a)    the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made), and

(b)    the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.”


	
	Both the long title to the 1994 FGM Act (see [98] above) and the heading of s.45 refer to “prohibition of female genital mutilation”. The term “female genital mutilation” is not used within the body of s.45 itself.
	
	
	The long title may be referred to as an aid to the construction of the 1994 FGM Act: Pearce and Geddes, “Statutory Interpretation in Australia”, Lexis Nexis Butterworths, 2014, 8th Edn, paragraph 4.48.
	
	
	The heading of the section shall be taken not to be part of the statute: s.35(2) Interpretation Act 1987. However, the heading of s.45 is available as extrinsic material under s.34 Interpretation Act 1987: s.35(5) Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	As will be seen, I consider the words “prohibition of female genital mutilation” as used in the long title and the heading, to have particular significance in the context of this case.
	


Use of Dictionary Definitions


	
	The Court was taken to a range of dictionary definitions concerning various terms in the course of submissions.
	
	
	If a word or phrase is not defined in a statute, it may be helpful to refer to a dictionary for its popular meaning (or meanings) or, where appropriate, its technical meaning (or meanings) and, in the latter context, specialist dictionaries such as legal or medical dictionaries may be of assistance: Pearce and Geddes, above, paragraph 3.30.
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind the observations of Mason P (Stein and Giles JJA agreeing) in House of Peace Pty Limited v Bankstown City Council [2000] NSWCA 44; 48 NSWLR 498 at 505 [28]:
	


“A dictionary may offer a reasonably authoritative source for describing the range of meanings of a word, including obsolete meanings. Dictionaries recognise that usage varies from time-to-time and place-to-place. However, they do not speak with one voice, even if published relatively concurrently. They can illustrate usage in context, but can never enter the particular interpretative task confronting a person required to construe a particular document for a particular purpose.”


	
	Mason P referred, at 506 [32], to the role of the Macquarie Dictionary:
	


“The Macquarie Dictionary was first published in 1981. One of its Prefaces discusses the need for an Australian Dictionary. It explains the sense in which that publication was the first general reference dictionary offering a comprehensive survey of Australian English. This should caution against undiscriminating selection from the body of material set out above. It certainly cautions against undiscerning aggregation.”

The learned President, at 506 [33], describes the Macquarie Dictionary as the “most authoritative Australian dictionary”.


	
	It is necessary to keep in mind that the Court must interpret a phrase as used in its context, assisted as it may be, but not necessarily bound, by one of a variety of dictionary definitions: Falconer v Pedersen [1974] VR 185 at 187; Pearce and Geddes, above, paragraph 3.30.
	
	
	I approach the use of the various definitions set out below with these statements of principle in mind.
	
	
	The verb “mutilate” is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary (6th Edn) as:
	


“1.   to remove a limb or other important part from (a person or animal, the body, etc.)

2.   castrate.

3.   to injure, disfigure, or make imperfect by removing or irreparably damaging parts.

[Latin mutilates, past participle, cut off, maimed].”


	
	“Mutilate” is defined in the Australian Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press (1999) as:
	


“1.   a.    deprive (a person or animal) of a limb or organ.

b.   destroy the use of (a limb or organ).

2.   render (a book etc.) imperfect by excision or some act of destruction.”


	
	“Mutilate” is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Volume II) 3rd Edn (1991 reprint) as:
	


“1.   to deprive (a person or animal) of a limb or organ of the body; to cut off or otherwise destroy the use of (a limb or organ)

2.   to render (a thing eg a record etc.) imperfect by cutting off or destroying a part”


	
	As the word “maim” was mentioned (in an historical sense at least) in the Macquarie Dictionary definition of “mutilate”, the Crown referred to the definition of “maim” in the Macquarie Dictionary which states:
	


“1.   to deprive of the use of some bodily member; mutilate; cripple.

2.   to impair; make essentially defective.

Noun - 3. Rare an injury or defect.”


	
	If the enquiry concerning the meaning of the word “mutilates” is confined to its bare dictionary meaning (unassisted by context or statutory purpose), the better view may be that more is required than the causing of injury. That view, however, must be tempered by the fact that the area of the body in question here is the sensitive and intimate part comprised of the female genital area. As the Crown submits, this feature should be kept in mind in construing the word “mutilates” in this context.
	
	
	A further feature may be elicited from reference to dictionary meanings. The term “female genital mutilation” itself has acquired a dictionary meaning in the Macquarie Dictionary and the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.
	
	
	The Macquarie Dictionary (online version) defines “female genital mutilation” in the following way:
	


“noun the practice of cutting the clitoris, either as a ritualistic nick, or by clitoral circumcision, or by clitoridectomy, sometimes with infibulation; illegal in Australia. Abbrev.: FGM.”


	
	The Oxford English Dictionary (online version) defines “female genital mutilation” in the following way:
	


“n. female circumcision or infibulation; injury to the external genital organs of girls and women resulting from this; abbreviated FGM.”


	
	The Oxford English Dictionary (online version) defines “female circumcision” as follows:
	


“n. an operation on the female genitals analogous to circumcision in males; spec. any of various traditional customs involving incision into or removal of part of the genitals of girls (as clitoridectomy and infibulation) practised in parts of northern Africa and elsewhere; female genital mutilation, female genital cutting.”


	
	This development accords with a view that the term FGM has become a type of term of art or catch-all term, describing a range of conduct extending from, at the lower end, cutting (including a nick) to, at the more extreme end, infibulation and clitoridectomy. I will return to this aspect later in the judgment.
	
	
	It is sufficient to say, at this point, that a focus upon a traditional meaning of the word “mutilates” in dictionaries provides limited assistance only in determining the meaning of the word “mutilates” in its present statutory context.
	
	
	It must be kept in mind, as well, that where s.34 Interpretation Act 1987 is utilised, the ordinary meaning of a term is not confined to its ordinary dictionary meaning. The ordinary meaning is that conveyed by the text of the provision, taking into account its context in the statute and the purpose or object underlying the statute: s.34(1)(a), (3)(a).
	


Other Uses of the Word “Mutilates” in Legal Dictionaries, Statutes and Court Decisions


	
	I derive no real assistance from consideration of the word “mutilate” or “mutilation” in other cases in different contexts in Australia or the United States of America. The cases referred to by counsel for the Accused persons do not, in my view, provide assistance in resolution of the present issue. Likewise, reliance upon the use of the word “mutilation” in s.268.47 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and s.67 Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth). In my view, those statutory contexts are far removed from the present case.
	
	
	The researches of counsel, and my researches, have not revealed any decision of direct assistance to the present issue of statutory construction in Australia.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, counsel for the Accused persons referred to the decision of Sir James Munby in B and G (Children (No. 2) v Leeds City Council and Ors. In that case, the Family Court considered the question of whether or not G (a female child) had been subjected to FGM in the context of an application for the child and her brother to be placed into care. The hearing proceeded over 12 days with evidence being given by a range of witnesses. The determination of the Family Court was that it was not possible to make a finding, on the evidence, that the child G had been had been subjected to FGM. The application for the children to be taken into care thus failed.
	
	
	The President of the Family Division considered the meaning of FGM by reference to the WHO and UNICEF classifications. The President said at [7]-[9]:
	


“Female genital mutilation (FGM)

7.   Before proceeding further, however, it is necessary to be clear as to what is meant by FGM. I start with Eliminating Female genital mutilation, an interagency statement published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others in 2008. Annex 2 sets out the following typology, dating from 2007:

‘Type I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy).

When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type I mutilation, the following subdivisions are proposed: Type Ia, removal of the clitoral hood or prepuce only; Type Ib, removal of the clitoris with the prepuce.

Type II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision).

When it is important to distinguish between the major variations that have been documented, the following subdivisions are proposed: Type IIa, removal of the labia minora only; Type IIb, partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora; Type IIc, partial or total removal of the clitoris, the labia minora and the labia majora.

Type III: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation).

When it is important to distinguish between variations in infibulations, the following subdivisions are proposed: Type IIIa: removal and apposition of the labia minora; Type IIIb: removal and apposition of the labia majora.

Type IV: Unclassified: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example, pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.’

8.    The same classification is reflected in the WHO’s Fact Sheet N241, Female genital mutilation, published in February 2014:

‘Female genital mutilation is classified into four major types.

1 Clitoridectomy: partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals) and, in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).

2 Excision: partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (the labia are ‘the lips’ that surround the vagina).

3 Infibulation: narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the inner, or outer, labia, with or without removal of the clitoris.

4 Other: all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.’

9.   For some purposes unicef uses a different classification. Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change, published by unicef in 2013, sets out the following typology (page 48):

‘types of FGM/C are classified into four main categories: 1) cut, no flesh removed, 2) cut, some flesh removed, 3) sewn closed, and 4) type not determined/not sure/doesn’t know. These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. Cut, no flesh removed describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. Cut, some flesh removed corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And sewn closed corresponds to Type III, infibulation’.”


	
	Sir James then turned, at [10]-[12], to the criminal legislation contained in the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (UK) (which is similar to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900):
	


“10.    Next, it is necessary to consider the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. It suffices for present purposes to refer to section 1, which is in the following terms:

‘(1)    A person is guilty of an offence if he excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of a girl’s labia majora, labia minora or clitoris.

(2)   But no offence is committed by an approved person who performs - 

(a)   a surgical operation on a girl which is necessary for her physical or mental health, or

(b)   a surgical operation on a girl who is in any stage of labour, or has just given birth, for purposes connected with the labour or birth.

(3)   The following are approved persons - 

(a)   in relation to an operation falling within subsection (2)(a), a registered medical practitioner,

(b)   in relation to an operation falling within subsection (2)(b), a registered medical practitioner, a registered midwife or a person undergoing a course of training with a view to becoming such a practitioner or midwife.

(4)   There is also no offence committed by a person who –

(a)   performs a surgical operation falling within subsection (2)(a) or (b) outside the United Kingdom, and

(b)   in relation to such an operation exercises functions corresponding to those of an approved person.

(5)   For the purpose of determining whether an operation is necessary for the mental health of a girl it is immaterial whether she or any other person believes that the operation is required as a matter of custom or ritual.’

Section 6(1) provides that ‘Girl includes woman.’

11.   It will be seen that for the purposes of the criminal law what is prohibited is to ‘excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate’ the ‘whole or any part’ of the ‘labia majora, labia minora or clitoris.’ This brings within the ambit of the criminal law all forms of FGM of WHO Types I, II and III (including, it may be noted Type Ia). But WHO Type IV comes within the ambit of the criminal law only if it involves ‘mutilation’.

12.   The word ‘mutilation’ is not further elaborated or defined in the statute, so I turn to the dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘mutilation’ as meaning ‘the action of mutilating a person or animal; the severing or maiming of a limb or bodily organ’, ‘mutilate’ being defined as meaning ‘To deprive (a person or animal) of the use of a limb or bodily organ, by dismemberment or otherwise; to cut off or destroy (a limb or organ); to wound severely, inflict violent or disfiguring injury on.”


	
	The extent of any further analysis of the criminal provision was confined to [70], where the President of the Family Division said:
	


“I should add that my conclusions in relation to whether FGM, including FGM Type IV, constitutes ‘significant harm’ for the purposes of family law, is quite separate from the question of whether particular examples of FGM Type IV involve the commission of criminal offences under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. As I have already pointed out, FGM Type IV comes within the ambit of the criminal law only if it involves ‘mutilation’. The question of whether a particular case of FGM Type IV – for example, the case as presented here by the local authority in relation to G – involves mutilation is, in my judgment, not a matter for determination by the family court, and certainly not a matter I need to determine in the present case. It is a matter properly for determination by a criminal court as and when the point arises for decision in a particular case.”


	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons that the only judicial interpretation of the UK equivalent of s.45(1)(a), as contained in this case, stated that:
	



	
	Types I, II and III of the WHO categories of FGM (see also [204]) come within the criminal prohibition, but that Type IV only comes within the prohibition if “mutilation” is involved;
	
	
	the term “mutilation” is able to be understood by reference to its ordinary meaning as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary.
	



	
	These propositions summarise the position reached by Sir James Munby, without the need to further decide, in that case.
	
	
	However, the task of construction for this Court under the law of this State, involves far more than the preliminary views expressed in the UK case. It is necessary for this Court to apply statutory and other principles to reach a conclusion in the context of this case.
	
	
	The UK decision is of interest to the Court in determining the present issue. Section 1(1) of the UK Act is relevantly the same as s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. It is noteworthy that the Family Court referred (at [12]) to a dictionary definition of the word “mutilates” for its purposes. However, it does not appear that any submission was put to the Family Court, let alone considered further, by reference to statutory context or the purpose or object of the legislation. Sections 33 and 34 Interpretation Act 1987 play a part in the resolution of the present issue.
	
	
	Insofar as the UK decision involves the expression of a judicial opinion concerning the capacity of the categories contained in the WHO classification to fall within the UK provision, it should be noted by this Court in the discharge of its task. Its usefulness, however, does not extend beyond that step.
	


Extrinsic Material Including Background to the 1994 FGM Act


	
	I am satisfied, for the purposes of s.34(1) and (3) Interpretation Act 1987,  that a proper foundation exists for the Court to consider extrinsic material under s.34 in the construction of s.45 and, in particular, the meaning of the words “otherwise mutilates”. This approach is taken principally because there is debate as to whether the narrow dictionary meaning of the word “mutilates” should be adopted, there is ambiguity concerning the term “mutilates” and there are competing submissions as to whether an absurd or unreasonable result would occur if a particular construction was adopted. “Ambiguity” in s.34 is not limited to lexical or verbal ambiguity and syntactic or grammatical ambiguity - it extends to circumstances in which the meaning is, for whatever reason, doubtful: R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; 54 NSWLR 300 at 312-313 [55] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	I am satisfied that a broad range of extrinsic material may be considered by the Court in the resolution of the present issue. Section 34(2) Interpretation Act 1987 provides for a non-exhaustive list of material which does not form part of the Act, but which is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision.
	
	
	It is apparent from the documentary material before the Court on this application (Exhibits PTP and PT7) that there was widespread community discussion in Australia by early 1994 concerning FGM.
	
	
	In September 1993, the Commonwealth Attorney General had asked the Family Law Council to examine, amongst other things, the adequacy of existing Australian laws to deal with the issue of FGM. The Family Law Council is a statutory authority established by s.115 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). In January 1994, the Family Law Council issued a discussion paper on FGM (Exhibit PTP, Tab 24) followed by a report issued in June 1994 (Exhibit PTP, Tab 25; Exhibit PT7, Tab 57). The Discussion Paper and Report were relied upon heavily during the Second Reading Debates surrounding the 1994 FGM Act.
	
	
	On 2 March 1994, the Attorney General, Mr Hannaford, informed the Legislative Council of his intention to introduce during that Parliamentary session “legislation to make female genital mutilation illegal in this State” (Exhibit PTP, Tab 14).
	
	
	Later in March 1994, debate occurred in the Legislative Council in which action was urged with respect to FGM (Exhibit PTP, Tab 15).
	
	
	It is useful, at this point, to refer to parts of the report of the Family Law Council of June 1994 (Exhibit PTP, Tab 25; Exhibit PT7, Tab 57). At page 6, paragraph 2.01, the Family Law Council said (footnotes omitted):
	


“2.01   Female genital mutilation.   Female genital mutilation ‘is the collective name given to several different traditional practices that involve the cutting of female genitals.’ It can involve any one of 4 procedures, although Armstrong suggests that ‘in reality the distinction between the types of circumcision is irrelevant since it depends on the sharpness of the instrument used, the struggling of the child and the skill and eyesight of the operator’.”


	
	The Family Law Council explained its understanding of the concept of FGM at pages 6-8, paragraphs 2.02-2.07 of the Report:
	


“2.02   ‘Circumcision’ of young women is a traditional cultural practice which is mainly performed in, but not confined to, a number of African countries. The global incidence of the practice is discussed later in this chapter. Those who oppose the practice call it ‘genital mutilation’. In this paper when the term ‘female genital mutilation’ is used it is meant to embrace all types of the practice where tissue damage results; for example, damage manifested by bruising, contusion or incision. However, where a specific procedure is being discussed, that particular procedure will be specified. Much of the information available on female genital mutilation, and referred to in this paper, relates to the practice as it is performed in African villages. It is therefore necessary to keep in mind that where the practice occurs in western countries it may not be under the same conditions using the same instruments, although the basic processes and their effects are similar.

2.03   Ritualised circumcision.   The first, and least severe form, is called ritualised circumcision. In this case the procedure may be wholly ritualised (e.g. where there is cleaning and/or application of substances around the clitoris). In other forms of ritualised circumcision the clitoris is scraped or nicked. This causes bleeding and may result in little mutilation or long term damage.

2.04   Clitoral circumcision.   The second form is generally simply called circumcision. It has also been called ‘sunna’. The word ‘sunna’ in Arabic means ‘tradition’, but it also means ‘tradition of Prophet Muhammad’ which indeed is a serious misnomer because the practice is not associated with Islam. Use of the term ‘sunna’ can lead to the incorrect linking of clitoral circumcision with the Islamic religion and, therefore, Council uses the term ‘clitoral circumcision’ in this report. Clitoral circumcision involves the removal of the clitoral prepuce - the outer layer of skin over the clitoris, which is sometimes called the ‘hood’. The glans and body of the clitoris are meant to remain intact. However, depending on factors such as the eyesight of the person performing the procedure, the type of implements used and the struggling of the child involved, it often can result in removal of the glans of the clitoris.

2.05   Clitoridectomy or excision.   A third form is called excision or clitoridectomy. This is said to be the most common form of female genital mutilation. It involves removal of the glans of the clitoris, but usually the entire clitoris, and often parts of the labia minora as well.

2.06   Infibulation.   The most severe form is infibulation or ‘Pharaonic’ circumcision. This involves removal of virtually all of the external female genitalia. The entire clitoris and labia minora and much of the labia majora is cut or scraped away. The remaining raw edges of the labia majora are then sewn together. In the villages acacia tree thorns are sometimes used and held in place with catgut or sewing thread. Sometimes a paste of gum arabic, sugar and egg is used to close the vulva. The entire area is closed up with just a small opening, about the size of a match stick, left for passing urine and menstrual fluid. A straw, stick or bamboo is inserted in the opening so that as the wound heals the flesh will not grow together and close the small opening. It is understood that in recent years in some areas, some doctors who perform the procedure sew together the labia without cutting.

2.07   The strong opposition to the practice of female genital mutilation is often, but not always, a reaction to the extreme version, infibulation. It is, however, important to place the practice of infibulation in perspective in the Australian context. In Council’s view, while there are women in Australia who have been infibulated, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that this particular procedure is being performed in this country. This issue is further discussed later in this chapter. It is also important, in discussing such matters as the effects of female genital mutilation, to keep in mind that much of the available literature relates to the more extreme versions of the practice.”


	
	In the course of examining the origins of FGM, the Family Law Council referred to the fact that the Daudi Bohra of India, an ethno-religious minority of half-a-million, was said to practice excision (pages 10, 13, paragraphs 2.17, 2.35).
	
	
	In its Report, the Family Law Council considered that there were several reasons for special legislation concerning FGM noting, in this respect (page 50, paragraph 6.37):
	


“•   Having a clear statement of the law on the issue will be a necessary part of community education about the practice;

•   There should be no doubt in any person’s mind that all forms of female genital mutilation are offences under Australian law; and

•   It is most important that there be visible laws against the practice of female genital mutilation, both as a deterrent to would-be perpetrators and as a protection and support for women and children who wish to resist the continuation of the practice. Such laws would also assist health workers and others in refusing to take part in such practices.”


	
	The Family Law Council recommended the enactment of special legislation, for reasons including those set out in the preceding paragraph (page 52, paragraph 6.41).
	
	
	The Family Law Council recommended that, to be fully effective, legislation should cover a range of matters, including the following (page 63, paragraph 6.80(a)):
	


“It should put the issue beyond doubt that female genital mutilation, in all of its forms, is a criminal offence.”


	
	The Explanatory Note, which accompanied the 1994 FGM Act, was in the following terms:
	


“Procedures involving the incision, and usually removal, of part or all of the external genitalia of young females are practised by some groups as a matter of custom or ritual. The practice can lead to infection, haemorrhaging, dysuria (painful urination) and dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation) due to pelvic congestion and complications during labour.

The object of this Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to make it an offence punishable by a maximum of 7 years imprisonment to mutilate external female genitalia or to aid, abet, counsel or procure such mutilation. An offence under the proposed section will be punishable even if committed outside of New South Wales if the mutilated person is ordinarily resident in New South Wales.

It will not be an offence for a doctor to perform a surgical operation that is necessary for the health of a person, for a doctor or midwife to perform a surgical operation on a person who is in any stage of labour or has just given birth or for a doctor to carry out a sexual reassignment procedure on a person.”


	
	The Second Reading Speech with respect to the 1994 FGM Act was delivered by the Hon RJ Webster on behalf of the Attorney General (Hansard, Legislative Council, 4 May 1994). The Minister commenced the Second Reading Speech as follows:
	


“This bill will make the practice of female genital mutilation a criminal offence in this State. Female genital mutilation, or FGM, is the term used to describe a number of practices involving the mutilation of female genitals for traditional or ritual reasons. The practice involves the excision or removal of parts or all of the external female genitalia. The procedure is usually performed on girls of tender age. It has been estimated that FGM occurs in more than forty countries, and tradition is the major factor which contributes to its continuation. While the practice is often linked to certain religious communities, this view is in fact mistaken. The origins of the practice pre-date most major religions.

The procedure of FGM has no physical benefits and is associated with a number of health hazards. The immediate physical effects of FGM, particularly in its most severe form, can include haemorrhage, shock, infection, and damage to nearby organs. Pain is said to last for some weeks following the procedure and can recur throughout life. The practice has been condemned at an international level. The World Health Organisation has recommended that governments adopt clear national policies to abolish the practice. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that all effective action be taken with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children. The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women provides that all appropriate measures be taken to eliminate discrimination in the field of health care.

The declaration on violence against women specifically includes female genital mutilation as part of its definition of violence against women. Some countries have moved specifically to prohibit the practice. The United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America have expressly prohibited FGM by way of legislation. In France FGM is not specifically penalised but is actionable under the penal code, which punishes violence against children. The Family Law Council of Australia recently released a detailed report on FGM. The council strongly recommended the introduction of legislation to make clear that FGM constitutes a criminal act and a form of child abuse. The Family Law Council observed that the extent to which any form of FGM is practised in Australia is not known. There has not been an open inquiry into the practice of FGM in this country.”


	
	The Minister turned to the rationale for specific legislation in New South Wales, including the clear deterrent and educational role to be played by enactment of legislation of this type:
	


“Of course, in New South Wales FGM could constitute an offence against the general assault and wounding provisions of the Crimes Act. However, the Government is of the view that a clear message should be sent to the community that the practice is not acceptable in this State. Such a message is given more clearly if there is a specific offence which expressly prohibits this conduct. Let it be made quite clear that in introducing this bill the Government is not intending to victimise or embarrass any particular group in our community. The bill has its roots in the protection of children from a practice that is extremely painful and has no beneficial physical effects.”


	
	The Minister then turned to the provisions of the Bill, with the following statement relied upon by the Accused persons in this case (see [130] above):
	


“I turn to the provisions of the bill. It will be an offence for anyone to perform FGM in this State. The three forms of FGM in order of severity are infibulation, clitoridectomy and sunna. The bill seeks to prohibit all of these various methods of FGM.”


	
	Soon after, the Minister stated that the “provision thus aims to prevent the FGM from being practised at all in this State”.
	
	
	The Minister emphasised the importance of community education concerning this provision, referring explicitly to the Family Law Council Report in this respect:
	


“Finally, the offence will carry a maximum term of seven years' imprisonment. Such a penalty is necessary for the purpose of deterrence and to reflect the seriousness with which the offence is viewed. A legislative proposal to make clear that FGM is a criminal offence is obviously a sensitive matter. There are a number of serious issues to be considered. These range from matters of child protection to issues concerning women, health and human rights. The Family Law Council emphasised in its report that community education is an important part of any overall strategy to deal with FGM. The Government recognises that the legislation, although forceful in its delivery of a social message, must be complemented by a community education program. An inter-departmental committee on FGM has therefore been convened to deal specifically with the content and implementation of such a program.”


	
	The Minister concluded the Second Reading Speech in the following way:
	


“It is important to stress that in passing a law against FGM the Government is not seeking to attack the values of any particular group in the community. Cultural diversity has always been recognised and supported in New South Wales. However, the wider community should not tolerate a practice which results in detrimental and unfortunate long-term physical effects. This is particularly so where the rights of young children are at stake. As responsible members of the community, we should place our condemnation of FGM beyond doubt. The legislation may lend support and comfort to those within certain cultures who oppose the practice but feel constrained to allow it to continue. The introduction of the legislation will provide much greater support to people who do not wish this procedure to be practised.”


	
	In the speech in reply, the Attorney General said (Hansard, Legislative Council, 10 May 1994):
	


“This legislation is aimed at protecting children who are resident in New South Wales. The law relating to child abuse will also apply to such children. Female genital mutilation will constitute child abuse as defined in the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987. Section 22 of that Act provides, in cases of child abuse, for a mandatory notification by the medical profession to the Director-General of the Department of Community Services. Officers in my department have consulted with officers in the Department of Community Services and the Child Protection Council regarding this issue.”


	
	In emphasising the intended scope of the provision, the Attorney General said in the speech in reply:
	


“Therefore the legislation in this regard is very tight and extremely tough. It is aimed at setting a clear example of the attitude of the Legislature to these offences. The Hon. Elisabeth Kirkby raised the concern that women may find themselves in a difficult position with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring offences because of cultural issues. In our view the provision is necessary as it ensures that those persons who are present assisting in the performance of female genital mutilation or who obtain the services of another to perform FGM will not escape the law. The objective of the legislation is to protect children from being subjected to FGM; indeed, it will lend comfort to those who do not wish to continue with the practice but, due to cultural pressures, have felt constrained to allow it to continue.”


	
	The Attorney General emphasised further the importance of the community education program, to be undertaken in conjunction with the enactment of s.45:
	


“Of course the decisions to charge and to proceed to trial are ultimately matters for the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions respectively, and I am not in a position to fetter the discretion of either of those agencies. The issues raised will be addressed in the community education program, which will be formulated by a number of administrations including the Department of Health, the Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Ministry for the Status of Women. The education program will be aimed at the health and medical professions as well as the relevant groups within the community. The education program will be sensitively administered by the office of ethnic affairs.

A number of questions were raised in relation to that program and, to reassure members of the House, I indicate that the Government has allocated $300,000 to the education program. The program will be conducted in three stages. Stage one will be an education program over 12 months targeted at health professionals. Stage two will be an education program over 12 months targeted at the general community and, in particular, the relevant community groups. Stage three will be an education program for those who are required to become mandatory reporters of FGM under the legislation. The education program for health professionals is necessary in order to formulate and develop protocols, procedures and support for medical professionals in dealing with the victims of FGM, including those who have had the procedure carried out overseas.

The proposed community education program is necessary to inform both the general community and the relevant community groups of the nature and implications of the legislation. Appropriate community education is necessary to deal with any adverse reaction to the legislation and is a necessary part of the Government's strategy for dealing with FGM. An education program for those required to become mandatory reporters is essential and requires sensitive handling. Broader education as part of child abuse prevention initiatives for those working directly with children, for example teachers and counsellors, requires funding and will get that funding. This part of the program will primarily involve the Department of School Education and the New South Wales Child Protection Council. The programs will draw upon existing programs in public agencies and will be based on the need to integrate education regarding FGM into existing programs dealing with child protection issues with the aim of equipping the agencies to integrate FGM as an issue for further programs.”


	
	The Second Reading Debate in the Legislative Assembly concerning the 1994 FGM Act commenced in May 1994 and continued in September 1994. The speeches in the Legislative Assembly reinforced the combination of enactment of a criminal offence and the need for a community education program. This is exemplified by the following extract from the speech of Mrs Chikarovski, Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, and Minister for the Status of Women, (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 22 September 1994):
	


“The Government recognises that Australia has a culturally diverse community. That is one of its strengths. But that is not to say that a culturally acceptable practice in other parts of the world is to be accepted in New South Wales as well. That is what this legislation is about: it is about saying that this practice is totally and completely unacceptable. In the past this matter would have come under existing child protection and criminal laws. However, today as a community we are concerned that a clearer message - to specifically outlaw female genital mutilation - must be sent. To do so only by legislation is not the approach; we must have an education program supporting the legislation. The Government recognises that as this is a cultural tradition people need to understand why it needs to be stopped. They need to understand why this particular cultural practice is not acceptable. That is why an education campaign will accompany the legislation.

The education campaign will be aimed at people within the community who want to practice this particular type of mutilation, but it will be aimed also at the health workers so that health workers understand what they need to be looking for and how to deal with this issue. The campaign will be targeted to the relevant communities, thus ensuring that the message is culturally appropriate and has the impact that we know this sort of campaign needs to have to ensure that women do not have to suffer this particular mutilation. The Government intends to work with the those communities, together with the Ethnic Affairs Commission, to ensure that this practice is stamped out. We understand that in certain communities we will need to make sure that people understand, that they come to terms with the fact that something they found to be acceptable is no longer acceptable. The community education campaign will enforce that message.”


	
	The 1994 FGM Act commenced on 1 May 1995. The community education program surrounding the commencement of the legislation was the subject of further comment in Parliament. The Hon MR Egan, Treasurer, stated (Hansard, Legislative Council, 31 May 1995):
	


“Members of the House will be aware that in September last year the Parliament passed the Crimes (Female Genital Mutilation) Amendment Bill. That legislation, which came into effect on 1 May this year - only a few weeks ago - will be supported by a 12-month community education program, for which the Ethnic Affairs Commission has been allocated $100,000. Those funds will be used to employ an officer to coordinate and develop support materials for the program. In relation to the programs initiated under the former Government, I am advised that a community education coordinator commenced duty at the Ethnic Affairs Commission on 24 April this year.

The program is supported by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Ethnic Affairs Commission and consisting of representatives of the Department of Women, Department of Health, Department of Community Services, Department of School Education, the Child Protection Council, the Attorney General's Department, the Privacy Committee and the Anti-Discrimination Board. The program will make contact with affected communities and provide them with resources to set up support systems and run their own educational programs. The program will also concentrate on the education of relevant professionals - including those in health, welfare and education - about protocols for dealing with female genital mutilation. In answer to the third part of the honourable member's question, I am also advised that after the 12 months duration of the project, it will be evaluated and the Government will determine what kinds of programs, if any, will be put in place in the future.”


	
	The approach taken by the legislature to the 1994 FGM Act, based upon the Family Law Council Report, is summarised neatly in the title of a 1995 article of Bill Hughes, the Director of Research of the Family Law Council - “Female Genital Mutilation: The Complementary Roles of Education and Legislation in Combating the Practice in Australia” (1995) 3 Journal of Law and Medicine 202.
	
	
	In circumstances where a community education program was linked inextricably by the legislature to the commencement and operation of the 1994 FGM Act, the Court was taken by the Crown to material which has been utilised as part of that program since the late 1990s. This extrinsic material is, in a sense, far removed from the usual extrinsic material to which a court will have resort where an issue of statutory construction arises. Material setting out a public servant’s understanding of the law has been considered unlikely to assist in the process of statutory construction: Pearce and Geddes, above, paragraph 3.26. However, it should be kept in mind that s.34(2) Interpretation Act 1987 provides a non-exhaustive list of extrinsic material which may be taken into account for the purpose of s.34(1) of that Act.
	
	
	Consideration of this educational material will, at the least, provide an understanding of what the community of New South Wales has been led to believe is the scope of s.45 Crimes Act 1900. It may, of course, be that the understanding promulgated through this material as part of a community education program is wrong. In effect, that is the submission advanced on behalf of the Accused persons. It remains for the Court to reach a conclusion with respect to the proper construction of the provision. I am satisfied that this material may be taken into account to understand the so far unchallenged meaning ascribed to s.45 and communicated to the community, including specific parts of the community where FGM was potentially a live question. This is especially so given the enactment of the 2014 FGM Amendment Act, where the fundamental importance of the community education program was once again explained.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a statement dated 13 August 2014 of Vivienne Strong, the then Manager of the New South Wales Education Program for Female Genital Mutilation (Exhibit PTP, Tab 38). A document entitled “NSW Education Program on Female Genital Mutilation”, in use since 2007, is in evidence (Exhibit PTP, Tab 34). Ms Strong explains the use that has been made of this document, as part of the community education program surrounding FGM, for a number of years. The document itself states (page 1):
	


“The NSW Education Program on Female Genital Mutilation (NSW FGM) is a state wide program funded through the NSW Department of Health. The Program commenced its work in September 1997 and ongoing funding has been provided in order that existing work could be consolidated, and further work with new and emerging communities could be planned and implemented.

What is Female Genital Mutilation?

Female genital mutilation (FGM) also known as female circumcision (FC) denotes the range of procedures involving partial or complete removal of the female genital organs. The World Health Organization recognises four different types of FGM (WHO 1995).”


	
	The document explains s.45 in the following way (page 3) (emphasis added):
	


“What is the law in NSW regarding the practice of FGM?

Section 45 of the NSW Crimes Act 1900, states that FGM is against the law.

A person cannot:

•   Excise, infibulate or mutilate the whole or any part of the labia minora or labia majora or clitoris of another person

•   Aid, abet, counsel or procure a person to perform any of these acts on another person

This means that it is against the law to:

•   Circumcise a woman, girl or female baby

•   Remove or cut out any part of the female genital area ('excise')

•   Stitch up the labia majora or labia minora of the female genitalia (infibulate)

•   Cut the clitoris or part of the clitoris 

•   Damage the female genital area in other ways.”


	
	Ms Strong explained in her statement the use of the WHO categorisation in this regard (paragraph 23):
	


“The FGM Program categorisation of FGM is based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) categorisation process of FGM. Female Genital mutilation is classified into four major types. These are the four types;

*   Type 1 Clitoridectomy: partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals) and, in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).

*   Type 2 Excision: partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (the labia are protective folds of tissue that cover the introitus or vaginal opening, and are sometimes known as 'the lips').

*   Type 3 Infibulation: narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the inner or outer labia, with or without removal of the clitoris.

*   Type 4 All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area. (Source: WHO Fact Sheet No 241 February 2012).”


	
	Accordingly, it may be seen that the community education program which has proceeded in this State since the 1990s has explained procedures prohibited by s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900 in a broad way, by reference to the WHO FGM classification and including, amongst other things, the cutting of the clitoris or part of the clitoris or “damage” to the female genital area in other ways.
	
	
	If the narrow construction advanced by the Accused persons (see [111] above) is accepted, then the question of what procedures are caught by s.45(1) will involve a matter of judgment, as to which minds may differ, as to whether more than injury, namely serious injury, has resulted from the procedure. Indeed, the defence construction would confine the operation of s.45 (and s.45A) to conduct which excises, infibulates or cuts off, destroys or alters radically the clitoris, labia major or labia minora. If this construction was correct, there would be a large gulf between what s.45(1) prohibits and the conduct communicated to the public by health authorities for many years.
	
	
	The 1994 FGM Act, and s.45 itself, is entitled “Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation”. The consistent theme of publications, including the authoritative work of the Family Law Council, indicated a proposed total ban on the carrying out of non-medical procedures, which may cause harm or injury, to the genital area of young girls.
	
	
	What has been understood for nearly two decades as a total prohibition on conduct of this sort would be altered radically, should the construction advanced on behalf of the Accused persons be accepted in this case.
	
	
	Laws in Australia concerning FGM have been the subject of ongoing consideration. In a final report entitled “Review of Australia’s Female Genital Mutilation Legal Framework” (March 2013), the Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department summarised the scope of existing State and Territory laws in the following way (Exhibit PTP, Tab 23, page 9) (emphasis added):
	


“Female genital mutilation is currently criminalised exclusively by State and Territory laws. An examination of these offences and feedback from relevant agencies indicates that all jurisdictions have passed criminal legislation that is generally reflective of the Model Laws. [Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) S73-77; Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s45, Criminal Code Act (NT) S186A-186D; Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) S323A-323B; Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) s33-33B; Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) S32-34A; Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) s178A, 178B, s389 and The Criminal Code (WA) s306.]

In all jurisdictions it is an offence for a person to perform any type of female genital mutilation. Although in some cases different language is used to define female genital mutilation, all definitions essentially cover the same conduct and are consistent with the definition of female genital mutilation accepted by the World Health Organization. Importantly, in all jurisdiction the consent of the victim, or their parent or guardian, is not a defence to female genital mutilation and specific granted for legitimate medical purposes (including those related to child birth and sex reassignment procedures).”


	
	It will be seen that the understanding expressed in a range of official documents is that the conduct prohibited by s.45 Crimes Act 1900 encompasses all conduct falling within the WHO FGM classification (see [204] above).
	
	
	I have mentioned earlier the amendments made by the 2014 FGM Amendment Act and their significance to the issues falling for consideration in this judgment (see [103]-[108] above). Certain submissions were made by reference to the Second Reading Debates surrounding that Act.
	
	
	I approach this aspect upon the basis that ss.45 and 45A must be read together. As noted, the definition of FGM in s.45A constitutes a simple reference back to conduct caught by s.45(1)(a) of the Act. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the Second Reading Debates surrounding the 2015 FGM Amendment Act may be considered as extrinsic material which assists upon the construction of s.45(1).
	
	
	In the Second Reading Speech, Mr Smith, the Attorney General, said (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 5 March 2014) (emphasis added):
	


“In December 2011 the Commonwealth Government announced the review of Australia's legislative framework criminalising female genital mutilation. In March 2013 the review of Australia's female genital mutilation legal framework made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring consistent offences and penalties. In April 2013 the Standing Committee on Law and Justice agreed to the recommendations. Female genital mutilation involves the partial or total removal of the female genitalia. It is an abhorrent practice. There are no health benefits and a number of short-and-long-term complications can arise from the practice. The immediate harm to the girl or woman can include severe pain, haemorrhage, tetanus and sepsis. Long-term health problems are associated with the practice.”


	
	Counsel for the Accused persons relied upon the underlined words in the Second Reading Speech.
	
	
	The Attorney General concluded the Second Reading Speech with a further reference to the importance of public education concerning FGM:
	


“The Government is committed to ending the practice of female genital mutilation. The Government will run a public awareness campaign to educate young women and the community about these legislative changes and the short- and long-term health consequences of the practice. These changes will ensure that people who perform female genital mutilation or take or arrange for persons to be taken from New South Wales to have female genital mutilation performed on them will receive appropriate punishment.”


	
	It will be noted that the Attorney has referred to the Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department Report of March 2013, to which reference has already been made (see [209] above). This Report was part of a recurring theme during the Second Reading Debates concerning the 2014 FGM Amendment Act.
	
	
	The contributions of a number of members to the debate emphasised the importance of the ongoing application of the criminal law and the community education campaign concerning FGM, which had been on foot for some time and which was to be re-emphasised. Speeches in this category included those of Mr Jonathan O’Dea, Ms Pru Goward, Minister for Planning and Minister for Women, and Mr Victor Dominello, Minister for Citizenship and Communities.
	
	
	Mr Mark Speakman, Parliamentary Secretary, opened his speech in the following way, drawing upon the WHO FGM classification:
	


“Female genital mutilation is an umbrella term that describes all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Female genital mutilation [FGM] includes clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation and harmful procedures such as pricking, piercing, incising, scraping or cauterising the genital area.”


	
	Mr Speakman emphasised, as well, what he described as the “multifaceted approach” which had been underway in New South Wales involving an education program on FGM. The Parliamentary Secretary said :
	


“As previous speakers have noted, female genital mutilation is an abhorrent procedure and the Government is committed to ending it. We are doing that not just by legislation but also by running a public awareness campaign to educate young women and the community about these legislative changes and the short- and long-term health consequences of the practice. The changes will ensure that people who perform female genital mutilation, or take people or arrange for them to be taken from New South Wales to have it done, will receive appropriate punishment.

As part of that multifaceted approach there is the ongoing New South Wales education program on female genital mutilation. It is a statewide program funded through the New South Wales Department of Health that commenced in 1997 and ongoing funding has been provided so that existing work can be consolidated and further work with new and emerging communities can be planned and implemented. The goals of the program are: to promote the development of a consistent and holistic health approach in working with communities and facilitate support and access to the full range of services for women, girls and their families affected by, or at risk of, the practice; to prevent the occurrence of female genital mutilation in New South Wales through an emphasis on community education, information and support; to assist women, girls and their families living in New South Wales who have been affected by the practice to minimise the harmful effects; and to strengthen community ownership of the issues and promote appropriate approaches to the prevention of female genital mutilation in New South Wales.

The program includes a professional education limb that targets counsellors, youth workers, health services, relevant government and non-government education, welfare workers and police. It also includes a community education program working directly with communities resident in New South Wales who have come from countries where female genital mutilation is practised. The increased penalties are an expression of the legislature's abhorrence of this practice. We are filling a gap in the legislation by inserting new section 45A so that there is a specific removal offence in New South Wales and this State catches up with every other Australian jurisdiction.”


	
	In the speech in reply in the Legislative Council, the Hon David Clarke, Parliamentary Secretary, emphasised, once again, the importance of the community education program (Hansard, Legislative Council, 13 May 2014):
	


“Several members made the point that increased penalties are not a sufficient response to the crime of female genital mutilation. The Government agrees; education is pivotal. That is why it is taking a whole-of-government educative approach with the Department of Attorney General and Justice, Family and Community Services, Women NSW, Health, the Community Relations Commission and other government departments and agencies to work together for an across-the-board response. However, the Crimes Amendment (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2014 is important.”


	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons that the Court should have regard to extrinsic material only to confirm that the meaning of “mutilates” in s.45(1) is the ordinary meaning of the word. It is important to keep in mind that s.34(1)(a) permits consideration to be given to extrinsic material to confirm that the meaning of the provision is “the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act … and the purpose or object underlining the Act …)”.
	
	
	In this case, I am satisfied that this enquiry extends beyond the dictionary meaning of the word “mutilates” and extends to the context in which the word is used, with a strong emphasis upon prohibition of FGM, and to assist an understanding of the purpose or object underlining s.45. This, in turn, will assist the Court, where competing constructions are available, to prefer a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the provision: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	The extrinsic material to which reference has been made sheds considerable light upon the purpose or object underlining the provision.
	
	
	I will return to this aspect when addressing principles of statutory construction. What has been said so far is sufficient to emphasise why I consider it highly relevant in this case to take into account an expansive range of extrinsic material bearing upon the important question falling for decision.
	


Some Syntactical Presumptions - Noscitur A Sociis and the Ejusdem Generis Rule


	
	The submissions for the Accused persons under these headings arise from the formula of words used in s.45(1)(a) - “a person who … excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates …”.
	
	
	The noscitur a sociis rule calls for the meaning of a word or phrase to be derived from its context. In the present case, the context of the phrase under consideration is broad and may be found or contributed to by factors both inside and outside the section.
	
	
	In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Dick [2007] NSWCA 190; 226 FLR 388, Spigelman CJ noted, at 391-392 [13], that the noscitur a sociis rule (the general principle of the law of interpretation that the meaning of a word can be gathered from its associated words) had a number of specific sub-principles with respect to the immediate textual context, with the most frequently cited principle being the ejusdem generis rule.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons (see [129] above), that a genus could be found in the phrase under consideration so as to invoke the ejusdem generis rule.
	
	
	Courts have recognised difficulty in application of the ejusdem generis rule where the word “otherwise” appears in the relevant phrase. This point was made by Windeyer J in Crowe v Graham [1968] HCA 6; 121 CLR 375 at 388 and by Sugerman P (Holmes JA and Taylor AJA agreeing) in Purdon v Dittmar (1972) 1 NSWLR 94 at 98-99. See Pearce and Geddes, above, paragraph 4.29.
	
	
	In Purdon v Dittmar, Sugerman P explained the point in the following way at 98-99 (incorporating a passage from the judgment of Windeyer J in Crowe v Graham) (emphasis added):
	


“The real problem is what is meant by these words, ‘otherwise  unlawfully obtained’, considered, not merely as an application of the ejusdem generis rule or of the principle noscitur a sociis, but considered as making an addition to, or as extending, the terms of what had been contained in s. 27. Because in my view there can be no question but that this was a deliberate change made in the law, an indication of an intention to get away from the application of the ejusdem generis doctrine. This is made clear, I think, by the meaning of the word ‘otherwise’ as explained in the large Oxford Dictionary. ‘Otherwise’ is defined as meaning: ‘In another way or in other ways; in a different way, or by other means, differently.’ In other words, the section now says ‘stolen or’ in some other or different way ‘unlawfully obtained’.

That accords, with respect, with the view which was taken by Windeyer J. in Crowe v. Graham. I should perhaps read a little more from what his Honour there said than the reference from the bar table. His Honour said: 

‘The words ‘or otherwise publishes’ in s. 16 (d) mean ‘or in other wise publishes’ that is to say ‘in some other manner or way publishes’. To read ‘or otherwise’ as meaning ‘likewise’, ‘in some like manner or way’, seems to me a departure from the ordinary meaning of the phrase. I do not think that the meaning and operation of s. 16 (d) are to be ascertained by asking what it would mean if the words ‘or otherwise publishes’ were not there, and then treating them as something added. It is true that they did not appear in an enactment which can be regarded as the forerunner of s. 16 (d). And it is true that that enactment appears to have been designed to prevent indecent prints and pictures being in one way or another forced upon the notice of unwilling persons. The acts if prohibited were nuisances, conduct annoying to persons unwillingly subjected to it. It can thus be said that if s. 16 (d) did not include the words ‘or otherwise publishes’ it would create a number of particular offences having a common characteristic, being in that sense generic. But the words ‘or otherwise publishes’ are there. Their effect is not to enlarge an existing genus by adding new things of like kind. It is to demonstrate a different and wider genus to which the prohibited acts all belong, namely publishing. Those who like Latin tags as rules of construction should remember that the ejusdem generis doctrine should be understood with, and in a sense as an exception to, the rule generalia verba sunt generaliter intelligenda.’

I pass by the difficulty which to my mind existed in the earlier decisions because there was not to be found there any such genus or family as was referred to in the case just cited. I come to the conclusion that the words ‘or otherwise obtained’ not only were deliberately inserted, but were so inserted by way of overcoming the operation of the ejusdem generis rule as it had previously been applied and by way of giving to the terms of s. 40,

as contrasted with s. 27 as it had been construed, an expanded meaning.”


	
	I do not accept the defence submission that, as a matter of construction, there is a genus with a common characteristic being causation of “serious injury”. Rather, the phrase in s.45(1) uses the words “excises” and “infibulates” and then moves, by words of expansion, using the term “otherwise mutilates”.
	
	
	In my view, the section may be construed appropriately as the legislature using two specific terms well recognised in the area of FGM (“excises” and “infibulates”) and then moving by way of an expansive third category (“otherwise mutilates”) to incorporate all other forms of FGM which section 45 itself was intended to prohibit.
	
	
	I do not think that application of syntactical presumptions operates to assist or support the submission advanced by the Accused persons in this case.
	


Submissions Made by Reference to Comparison of the Crown Submission Concerning s.45(1) and Elements of the Alternative Charges Under s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900


	
	A discrete submission was made by Mr Bouveng, inviting a comparison between the Crown submission as to the meaning of “mutilates” in s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900 and an element of the alternative counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm under s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900 as contained in Counts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the Indictment. It was submitted that, if the Crown submission was accepted, the conduct falling within the term “mutilates” in s.45(1) would, in effect, be less than that required to constitute “actual bodily harm” for the purpose of s.59(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the separate origins of these provisions and submitted that the meaning of the term “actual bodily harm” in s.59(2) did not bear upon the proper construction of s.45 of the Act. It submitted, as well, that the confined operation of s.45 (to the female genital area) was relevant, by way of contrast with the general application of s.59(2) to any part of the body of a person.
	
	
	As directions will need to be formulated in due course concerning the elements of the s.59(2) offence as charged in the Indictment, it is appropriate at this point say something about this submission.
	
	
	In McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305; 198 A Crim R 549, with the agreement of Macfarlan JA and Blanch J, I said at 558-559 [40]-[44]:
	


“40   What is an assault? The traditional common law distinction between assault and battery has largely fallen away for the purpose of application of the modern law of assault. The distinction between assault and battery noted that an assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend the infliction of immediate unlawful force on his or her person, and a battery is the actual infliction of unlawful force on another person: R v Knight (1988) 35 A Crim R 314 at 316-317. Where the assault takes the form of a battery, what is required is an intentional touching of the victim without that person’s consent and without lawful excuse: Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 38 NSWLR 184 at 192, 200. 

41   A practical distinction is sometimes drawn between a physical assault (or battery assault) and psychic assault (or apprehended unlawful force assault): Fitzgerald v Kennard at 200-201; Mikhael v Conroy (Finlay J, 6 December 1990, unreported, BC9002962 at pages 8-15); Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris (2005) 63 NSWLR 263 at 273-274 [48]-[49].

42   It is not an element of the crime of assault that injury be caused to the victim. Any touching of another person, however slight, may amount to a physical assault. It has been said that the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it: Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB (Marion’s Case) [1991]-[1992] 175 CLR 218 at 233, 265-266; Collins v Wilcock [1984] 1 WLR 1172 at 1177. 

43   If actual bodily harm was occasioned by an assault, then the offender is liable to conviction and sentence for a more serious offence where the occasioning of actual bodily harm is an element of the offence. In the case of a police officer victim, this offence arises under s.60(2). In the case of a victim who was not a police officer, the relevant offence is one under s.59 of the Act. 

44   The term ‘actual bodily harm’ is not defined in the Crimes Act 1900. The phrase ‘bodily harm’ has been said to include any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim: R v Overall (1993) 71 A Crim R 170 at 178. It need not be permanent, but must be more than merely transient or trifling - it is something less than ‘grievous bodily harm’, which requires really serious physical injury, and ‘wounding’, which requires breaking of the skin: R v Lardner (NSWCCA, 10 September 1998, unreported, BC9804715 at page 4). The distinction between grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm involves an assessment of the degree of harm done, with one being more serious than the other: R v Overall at 173-174. Bruises and scratches to a victim are typical examples of injuries that are capable of amounting to actual bodily harm: R v Cameron [1983] 2 NSWLR 66 at 67. If a victim has been injured psychologically in a very serious way, going beyond merely transient emotions, feelings and states of mind, that would likely amount to actual bodily harm: Li v R [2005] NSWCCA 442 at [45].”


	
	I do not discern from what was said at 558 [44] concerning the term “actual bodily harm”, any aspect which assists the Accused persons in the resolution of the present question.
	
	
	It must be borne in mind that s.45(1) is directed to procedures undertaken in a delicate, sensitive, intimate and precise part of the female anatomy, usually of a young girl. As I have said, the proper meaning of the word “mutilates” will keep this aspect clearly in mind. An offence under s.59(2) however, involves the infliction of actual bodily harm to any part of the body of the alleged victim. I see nothing in this part of the submissions which assists the Accused persons.
	


Conclusion Concerning The Proper Construction of the Words “Otherwise Mutilates” in s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900


	
	I have set out, at considerable length, my analysis of matters advanced by the parties as bearing upon the proper construction of s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900. As would be apparent, the issue raised in these proceedings is a novel one, not considered previously by a superior court in this country.
	
	
	The relative novelty of the proceedings, and the legal and factual issues raised by them, no doubt contributed to the decision of the Chief Justice to authorise the present trial to proceed in this Court under s.128 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The ordinary meaning of the word “mutilates” is not to be found by reference solely to dictionary definitions of that term. The ordinary meaning to be accorded to the term should take into account the context in which the word appears and the purpose or object of the provision: s.34(1) Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	In this case, the relevant context includes the fact that the word “mutilation” forms part of a concept described as FGM. The word “mutilates” in s.45(1) was not selected by the legislature in a vacuum. Rather, the word should be understood as part of a formula of words (FGM) which itself has now taken on its own dictionary meaning (see [157]-[159] above). The term FGM has been described in various ways, including “a collective name” (see paragraph 2.01 of the Family Law Report at [181] above) or “umbrella term” (see Mr Speakman’s speech at [218] above).
	
	
	The meaning and use of the word “mutilates”, in other factual and legal contexts, provides no real assistance to the resolution of the present question.
	
	
	As the long title to the 1994 FGM Act and the heading to s.45 itself make clear, the legislation is directed to the prohibition of FGM. The conduct sought to be prohibited by the section is, according to the material referred to so far in this judgment, usually performed by non-medical persons operating in circumstances of some secrecy and using instruments not designed for surgery. This characterisation is not intended to in some way define FGM. Rather, it is intended to place, in a practical context, the conduct which s.45 is intended to prohibit or eradicate.
	
	
	At the forefront of resolution of this issue is the fact that any FGM procedure will be directed, as a matter of course, to the sensitive and intimate female genital area, usually of young girls. To attempt to prescribe what conduct fell inside or outside the terms of s.45(1) would be fraught with difficulty, when it has been recognised that substantial margin for error may well surround the performance of FGM procedures generally (see paragraph 2.01 of the Family Law Council Report at [181] above).
	
	
	The strongest argument in support of the defence construction is the reference by the Minister in the Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Council in 1994 to three categories intended to be covered by the legislation, with the third being “sunna” (see [190] above). The term “sunna” was explained (to some extent) in the Second Reading Speech and was further considered in the report of the Family Law Council (see paragraph 2.04 of the Family Law Council Report at [182] above). On this approach, s.45(1) would presumably not extend to conduct described by the Family Law Council as “ritualised circumcision” (see [182] above), where the clitoris may be scraped or nicked or to WHO Type 4 conduct, involving harmful procedures for non-medical purposes, including pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterising (see [204] above).
	
	
	A difficulty with this approach is that even the term “sunna” lacks precision. As used in the Family Law Council Report, it involves removal of the clitoral prepuce or hood, leaving the glans and body of the clitoris intact (see [182] above). To cut out or off part of the female anatomy in this way itself would constitute an excision. On this approach, what work is to be done by the words “otherwise mutilates”?
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate course is to look at the purpose or object of the legislation, and to consider which construction would promote that purpose or object: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987. I would reduce the competing constructions to the following propositions:
	



	
	the Crown submission that s.45(1) extends to the causing of any injury for non-medical reasons - a construction which would pick up physical contact with the relevant part of the genital area and the causing of some harm resulting in injury of any type - this approach serves to promote the purpose or object of s.45 in prohibiting or eradicating FGM procedures generally;
	
	
	the defence submission which would allow under s.45 the infliction of injury as part of a FGM procedure, as long as it was not serious injury which cut off, destroyed or altered radically a part of a child’s genital area - this construction would allow FGM procedures which caused injury or harm but which fell short of the proposed defence construction - this construction would not serve to promote the purpose or object of the Act which was to prohibit and eradicate FGM procedures.
	



	
	In the unusual circumstances of s.45, where its legislative origin is linked inextricably with invocation of the criminal law and education of the community with a view to prohibition and eradication of FGM procedures, the education material referred to earlier provides assistance to the Court. At the least, this material, taken with other publications in evidence, serves to demonstrate that the defence construction of the provision would serve to undermine, rather than promote, the intention of the legislature to prohibit FGM procedures.
	
	
	I do not think that resolution of the present question is assisted by recourse to Parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom. A defence submission by reference to some statements made in 1983 in the House of Lords does not, in my view, assist the construction of a local statute in this State.
	
	
	I do not consider that the location of ss.45 and 45A in Division 6 of Part 3 Crimes Act 1900 operates against the construction advanced by the Crown. The offences involve the causation of injury to the person, importantly, in a sensitive and intimate part of (usually) a young girl’s body. They fall within the general description of “Offences Against the Person” and “Acts Causing Bodily Harm”.
	
	
	Nor do I consider that the defence submission concerning female genital cosmetic surgery (see [131] above) assists the resolution of the present construction issue. The 2013 Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department Review noted that the role of such surgery had been raised on the review. The Report said (Exhibit PTP, Tab 23, page 9):
	


“The broad definition of female genital mutilation and explicit removal of consent as a defence has raised some issues in relation to female genital cosmetic procedures. Anecdotal evidence suggests female genital cosmetic surgery has increased significantly since 1998, when the model legislation (and the majority of State and Territory offences) was drafted. Certainly, there are many examples of surgeons advertising procedures for Australian clients.

While most public discourse distinguishes between female genital cosmetic surgery and female genital mutilation, female genital cosmetic surgery may involve procedures that are technically very similar to those defined in the legislation. The status of these procedures under existing laws is untested. This is a complex issue, which this Report has been unable to fully consider. Further work should be done in close consultation with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies, communities, experts and other stakeholders to clarify the legal and policy position on female genital cosmetic procedures.”


	
	The practical answer to this aspect is that investigatory and prosecutorial discretion will limit attention being given to female genital cosmetic procedures undertaken on consenting adults, even if the conduct in question was capable technically of falling within s.45. It may be taken that the authorities will direct their attention to the well-recognised context in which FGM occurs, as exposed in extrinsic material including the community education publications, in use for many years.
	
	
	I do not think that the construction advanced by the Crown involves any form of statutory overreach. The degree of injury or harm established in a particular case under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 would be relevant to the question of penalty if a person or persons were convicted of the offence: s.21A(2)(g), (3)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	In approaching this construction question, I have kept firmly in mind the statements of Bathurst CJ in Rail Corporation New South Wales v Brown (see [136] above) and of the High Court of Australia in Milne v The Queen (see [138] above). The task of the Court is to construe s.45. It is not for the Court to construe its own idea of a desirable policy, impute that to the legislature and then characterise it as a statutory purpose. The purpose of construction does not justify a court in expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits.
	
	
	In the construction or interpretation of a statute, the object of the court is to ascertain, and give effect to, the will of Parliament: Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29; 213 CLR 401 at 418 [8] (Gleeson CJ). I am satisfied that the construction of s.45(1) advanced by the Crown, which I accept reflects the will of Parliament. It arises after application of relevant principles of statutory construction, including application of ss.33 and 34 Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	Accordingly, I accept the Crown submission as to the directions to be given to the jury in this case (see [110] above). I reject the submission made on behalf of the Accused persons in this respect (see [111] above).
	


The Meaning of the Word “Clitoris” in s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900


	
	The counts in the Indictment charging offences under s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 allege that the relevant Accused “mutilated the clitoris” of C1 or C2.
	
	
	In the course of oral submissions, it became clear that it may be necessary for the Court to construe the word “clitoris” as used in s.45. This arose, in particular, given reference in the submissions to injury to the clitoris or other areas, including the prepuce of the clitoris.
	
	
	In written submissions dated 20 August 2015, the Crown submitted that the prepuce, also known as the clitoral hood, should be considered as part of the clitoris. Given that the prepuce is a fusion of the labia minora and the clitoral glans, the Crown accepted that it could also be considered part of the labia minora. In the context of s.45, it was submitted that the term “clitoris” should be given a wide meaning.
	
	
	In defence written submissions dated 20 August 2015, it was submitted that the prepuce does not form part of the clitoris, and that a direction along these lines should be given to a jury at trial.
	
	
	The defence written submissions point to a number of dictionary definitions of “clitoris” and “prepuce”:
	


“3.   ‘Clitoris’ is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, Online as:

A homologue of the male penis, present, as a rudimentary organ, in the females of many of the higher vertebrata. 

4.   ‘Prepuce’ is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, Online as:

The fold of skin that surrounds the clitoris is also called the prepuce. 

9.   ‘Clitoris’ is defined in the Blacks Medical Dictionary 41st edition, A & C Black Publishers Limited (2005) as:

A small, sensitive organ comprising erectile tissue at the top of the female genitalia where the labial folds meet below the public bone. Clitoral tissue extends into the anterior roof of the vagina. During sexual excitement the clitoris enlarges and hardens and may be the focus of orgasm.”


	
	Both the Crown and counsel for the Accused persons took the Court to parts of the report of Dr Marks concerning the clitoris, prepuce and other relevant terms.
	
	
	The defence written submissions refer, as well, to a provision in the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 which referred more expansively to the performance of an action “to the whole or any part of the labia majora, labia minora, prepuce of the clitoris, clitoris or vagina of another person”. It was said that the Scottish Parliament had adopted a formula which demonstrated that the prepuce of the clitoris was separate to the clitoris itself, but that it was included for the purpose of FGM legislation in that jurisdiction.
	
	
	I have set out the competing submissions on this topic in this judgment. Counsel have not addressed orally on the written submissions made on 20 August 2015.
	
	
	To an extent, the issue is capable of being moot. The definitions and medical reports serve to demonstrate that if the prepuce is not part of the clitoris, it is part of the labia minora. Both of these terms are used expressly in s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. Of course, if this construction operated, it may be necessary for the Crown to consider an amendment to the Indictment.
	
	
	However, as presently advised, I approach the meaning of the word “clitoris” in s.45 with a broader understanding of the context in which it is used, and the purpose or object of the provision. FGM procedures are not carried out by surgeons using proper instruments in the sterile surrounds of an operating theatre.
	
	
	That is not to say that the word “clitoris” takes on a very broad meaning incorporating parts of the female genital area which cannot, on any practical and sensible view, be considered part of the clitoris. It must be kept in mind that the legislature has identified three particular areas in s.45(1)(a) and has not used a broader term such as “genital area”.
	
	
	However, as presently advised, I am satisfied that, as a matter of construction, the clitoris and the prepuce of the clitoris are so closely interrelated that the prepuce may be regarded as part of the clitoris although, for technical purposes, it may also be regarded as part of the labia minora.
	
	
	In my view, this aspect need not be further progressed in this judgment. It is sufficient to express these provisional views, with the topic to be further addressed by counsel in the formulation of written directions on this aspect.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the reasons expressed in this judgment, I am satisfied that the jury should be directed at the trial of the Accused persons, with respect to the word “mutilates” in s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, in accordance with the submission advanced by the Crown.
	
	
	With respect to directions to be given concerning the term “clitoris” in the section, subject to any further submission, I have in mind directing the jury that the word “clitoris” in s.45(1)(a) is capable of including the prepuce of the clitoris.

		13 November 2015",2015-08-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702850,A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R [2015] NSWCCA 244,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: On 27 August 2015, Johnson J delivered a judgment in a trial which was soon to commence with a jury: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221. Later that afternoon, on behalf of each of the accused there was filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against Interlocutory Judgment or Order (“the Notice”) pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The Court convened on 28 August 2015 to deal with an issue of whether the judgment is properly the subject of an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3); in other words whether the proposed appeal is competent. At the conclusion of the hearing an order was made refusing the application for leave to appeal on the basis that it was incompetent. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.
	
	
	Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act relevantly provides:
	


“(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:

(a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or

(b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.”


	
	It was intimated before Johnson J following the delivery of his judgment that an application may be made for him to issue a certificate pursuant to s 5F(3)(b). His Honour subsequently indicated that he would defer this issue given the matter was to be before this Court the next day.
	
	
	The Notice indicated that the “Judgment or Order Appealed Against” was:
	


“The judgment of Johnson J concerning the statutory construction of ‘mutilates’ for the purposes of s 45 Crimes Act 40/1900 (NSW), cited as R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221.”


	
	The “Judgment or Order Sought” from this Court was:
	


“Re-determine the definition of ‘mutilates’ in accordance with submissions by the Applicants.”


	
	The proposed grounds of appeal were:
	


1.   His Honour erred in accepting the Crown submission as to the direction to be given to the jury in this case being that “any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons” is the definition of ‘mutilates’ for the purposes of s 45 Crimes Act 40/1900 (NSW).

2.   His Honour’s determination is wrong as a matter of statutory construction.

3.   His Honour’s determination is infected with error as a result of applying the facts of this case to the question of statutory interpretation of the decision.

An issue as to the meaning of “mutilates” in s 45 of the Crimes Act


	
	A2, KM and Mr Vaziri have each pleaded not guilty to charges under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): female genital mutilation contrary to s 45(1)(a) and, in the alternative, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, contrary to s 59(2).
	
	
	The relevant provision of s 45 is:
	


“45 Prohibition of female genital mutilation

(1) A person who:

(a) excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person, or

(b) …

is liable to imprisonment for 21 years.”


	
	A2 and KM are charged as principals and Mr Vaziri is charged as an accessory after the fact with the alleged mutilation of the clitoris of a child, identified as C1, between specified dates and of the clitoris of another child, identified as C2, between other specified dates.
	
	
	Johnson J had been involved in this matter for some weeks dealing with a number of pre-trial applications. At the time the matter came before this Court, it was anticipated that empanelment of a jury would occur on Monday 7 September 2015. The trial was anticipated to run for four weeks.
	
	
	According to the judgment in question (at [2]) the parties persuaded his Honour that a particular issue was of significance to the proceedings generally and requested that it be dealt with as a matter of priority. His Honour acceded to that request. His Honour described the issue as follows:
	


""[3] This issue concerns the directions to be given to the jury, in the circumstances of the present case, concerning the meaning of certain words in s.45 Crimes Act 1900. In particular, attention was focused upon the meaning of the words ‘otherwise mutilates’ in s.45(1).

[4] In the circumstances of this case, the Court was satisfied that it was appropriate to deal with this topic as a pretrial issue. In doing so, the Court is not considering an application for the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay based upon a claim that the charges are foredoomed to fail: Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119; 80 NSWLR 486 at 490 [15]-[19]. Nor is the Court engaging in a process of fact finding in advance of the trial or seeking to determine whether the Crown has a case that should be left to a jury: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 212, 214-215.

[5] Rather, the Court is construing relevant words in s.45, a legal function, with some reference to evidence to be adduced in the trial to provide some context, meaning and understanding to the elements of the s.45 offence in this case. This is being done to aid the formulation of directions to be given to a jury concerning the elements of the offence.""


	
	His Honour outlined the competing submissions of the parties as follows:
	


""[110] The Crown submits that any physical injury to any extent to the female genital organs, which is done for non-medical reasons, can amount to mutilation for the purposes of s.45. The Crown submits that a nick or cut to the genitalia for the purposes of FGM is capable of falling within the concept of mutilation in s.45. The Crown says that, at the very least, the procedure performed by KM on C1 and C2 was a cutting or nicking (including pricking or piercing) of the clitoris so as to be capable of falling within the terms of s.45. The Crown submits that the jury should be directed that any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons falls within the meaning of ‘mutilation’ for the purpose of s.45 Crimes Act 1900.

[111] Mr Sutherland SC, for A2 and Mr Vaziri, and Mr Bouveng, for KM, joined in a submission that a jury should be directed that the word ‘mutilates’ in s.45 means to cut off, destroy, or alter radically a part of the body, in the present case (given the terms of the Indictment), the clitoris.""


	
	His Honour then set out his consideration of the issue before expressing his conclusion (""the ruling"") as follows:
	


""[272] For the reasons expressed in this judgment, I am satisfied that the jury should be directed at the trial of the Accused persons, with respect to the word ‘mutilates’ in s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, in accordance with the submission advanced by the Crown.""

Was the proposed appeal competent?


	
	A fundamental issue in this proceeding was whether the ruling of Johnson J set out above is an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" that is amenable to appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Senior counsel for the applicants A2 and Vaziri clarified at the outset of the hearing that he sought to establish that the Court had jurisdiction because the matter concerned an interlocutory ""judgment"", as opposed to an ""order"".
	
	
	In AF v R [2015] NSWCCA 35 I set out the following concerning the meaning of ""interlocutory judgment or order"" in s 5F:
	


""[30] In R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; 129 A Crim R 126, an appeal by both Crown and accused on a joinder/severance issue which arose as a consequence of evidentiary rulings, Wood CJ at CL said the following about the jurisdiction of this Court under s 5F:

'[10] Essential to a review under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act is the existence of an ‘interlocutory judgment or order’. A wide range of matters have been held to fall within the ambit of this expression, including orders for, or refusal of, separate trials (R v Saunders and R v Georgiou (1999) NSWCCA 125). However, rulings on the admissibility of evidence have been held not to be interlocutory judgments or orders within the meaning of the section: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136, R v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253, R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 and R v Bailey (1988) 36 A Crim R 30; save where the consequence of the judgment is to rule out all of the Crown evidence leaving it without a case: R v Bozatis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296.

[11] The distinction, it seems, depends in the case of a judgment, upon it determining the proceedings, or at least an identifiable part of them, and being capable of entry in the records of the Court: R v Steffan at 636; or in the case of an order, upon it amounting to a command that something be done or not done: The King v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315 at 324, 361, and Steffan at 636. In Steffan it was said that it was not immediately self-evident how a ruling upon the admissibility of evidence could answer either description. Additionally it was noted that an evidentiary ruling lacks finality, in that it can be changed in the course of the trial.'

[31] It has been acknowledged that there is no bright line test for discriminating between judgments or orders, on the one hand, and rulings which do not constitute judgments or orders, on the other. After referring in this respect to the judgment of Sheller JA in R v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197, Gleeson CJ continued in his judgment in R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303 as follows:

'King CJ, in Legal Practitioners’ Complaint Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 drew a distinction between judgments or orders and what he called “incidental rulings”. A judgment or order, he said, is a ‘judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings’. However, rulings also decide questions. It is the character of the question, and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference.

One of the reasons given for denying to a ruling on evidence, in the ordinary case, the quality of a judgment or order is that it can be changed during the course of the proceedings. It lacks finality. It does not require a decision of an appellate court to reverse it; at least in theory the judge can be persuaded to alter it.

In Commonwealth v Mullane (1961) 106 CLR 166 the High Court had to consider whether a decision under review, which involved a ruling on a point of law, amounted to a judgment, decree, order or sentence. In a passage at 169, cited by Sheller JA in Lethlean, the court said:

‘What his Honour did was simply to give a ruling on a point of law which was raised. It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed. The County Court judge might have altered his mind, he might have ruled otherwise, he might have qualified his ruling, there was no determination.’” [Emphasis added.]


	
	Senior counsel submitted that the authorities recognise that it is necessary to have regard to substance rather than form. This may be accepted as Gleeson CJ said in the passage from R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303 extracted above that: ""it is the character of the question, and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference"". See also R v Cheikho [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 at [25] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	Senior counsel emphasised that the ruling by Johnson J followed a detailed assessment of evidence and submissions and that the reasons are lengthy and considered; the judgment itself running to 85 pages or 273 paragraphs. That, with respect, is an irrelevant consideration. The judgment of the Court (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Sharpe JJ) in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 included an observation that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence may be accompanied (as it was in that case) by elaborate reasons which have been expressed in a document called a ""judgment"". But that involved an entirely different usage of the word ""judgment"" and was concerned with the reasons which have been expressed rather than the formal act of the court.
	
	
	Emphasis was placed upon the fact that the issue as to the meaning of ""mutilates"" in s 45(1)(a) is ""unique"" and not the subject of any binding authority. It was submitted that if it had been determined in the applicants' favour, it might have led to the making of applications for orders that would be clearly amenable to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3), such as for a stay of proceedings on the basis that, having regard to the evidence available to the Crown, the prosecution was foredoomed to fail: see, for example, Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378. However, contemplating what might have followed if the ruling had been other than what it was is a distraction.
	
	
	Senior counsel sought to characterise the ruling as ""categorical"" and suggested there was some significance in it concerning a point which he described as being ""of extreme importance to the trial"". Again, however, the importance of the ruling for the trial is not a relevant matter, at least in the context of this case. In W O v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 275 at [59], Basten JA (Fullerton and McCallum JJ agreeing) said the following about pre-trial rulings that may concern important issues in a trial and appeals against interlocutory judgments or orders:
	


""The fact that rulings may affect the outcome does not provide a sufficient basis for permitting an interlocutory appeal. If an appeal were available in such circumstances, many rulings on evidence and disputed directions to the jury would become the potential subject of an interlocutory appeal. That the phrase 'interlocutory judgment or order' in s 5F does not extend so far is well-established."" [Emphasis added]


	
	The significance of the issue the subject of the ruling explains why Johnson J was prepared to accede to the request of the parties to deal with it as a pre-trial issue. But the fact that it was determined pre-trial, whereas most rulings on the manner in which a jury will be directed are made during a trial, does not convert the ruling into something which it is not. Senior counsel for the applicant conceded that an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) would not be an option if the ruling had been made during the trial.
	
	
	The ruling was akin to the decision of the trial judge that was held by this Court not to be an interlocutory judgment or order in W O v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW). In that case, the trial judge determined prior to empanelment of a jury whether an offence of attempting to have sexual intercourse without consent (s 61P of the Crimes Act) was an offence of specific intent which would impact upon the relevance of the accused's intoxication at the relevant time. Her Honour also ruled on whether s 61HA of the Crimes Act (which is concerned with knowledge about consent in relation to certain sexual assault offences) applied. The judge ruled that the offence was not a crime of specific intent and that the provisions of s 61HA applied. Basten JA (Fullerton and McCallum JJ agreeing) held:
	


""[30] Although in the present case the judgment given by the trial judge will no doubt have consequences in respect of the admissibility of evidence at a later stage in the trial, assuming it is not varied, it was not in terms a ruling on the admissibility of specific evidence. Rather, it should be characterised as a preliminary determination of certain questions of law which were anticipated as likely to arise in the course of the proceedings. In that respect, this case bears similarities to R v Adamson [2005] NSWCCA 7 and Regina v Piper [2005] NSWCCA 134.""


	
	R v Adamson [2005] NSWCCA 7 was also concerned with an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F against a pre-trial ruling that a particular offence was not one of specific intent for the purpose of the intoxication provisions in Pt 11A of the Crimes Act. It was held by Spigelman CJ (Dunford and Hidden JJ) that:
	


""[5] His Honour made no order. The submission in this court is that his Honour's reasons for decision constituted a judgment within the meaning of s 5F of the Act. Mr G Wendler, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that his Honour's judgment involved a final legal ruling on a discrete legal controversy which had arisen in the proceedings. Mr Wendler submitted that, in effect, what his Honour had done was to make a declaration that s 428C does not apply to ss 195(6) or 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

[6] There is no such declaration. In my view, what Blackmore DCJ did on the application of the applicant was no more than to indicate what he would do, if he were the trial judge, if evidence of intoxication were sought to be adduced over objection, or if such evidence was otherwise before the court, what direction he would give to the Jury on the issue of intention. It is clear that if his Honour was the trial judge that he would, in the latter case, direct the Jury that intoxication was not able to be taken into account on the issue of intention, on the basis that neither of the offences with which the applicant was charged was an offence of specific intent.

[7] This, in my opinion, is not a judgment or order within s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. It does not have the requisite element of finality in terms of resolving an issue in the proceedings in a binding manner. It is closely analogous, in my opinion, to the admission of evidence. Indeed one of the two ways in which the conclusion to which Blackmore DCJ came could, in fact, be applied would be on a ruling relating to evidence of intoxication, if it were sought to be adduced over objection.”


	
	R v Piper [2005] NSWCCA 134 was concerned with a ruling on the admissibility of evidence in relation to a proposed defence of mental illness. It was an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(2) but still turned on whether the ruling was an ""interlocutory judgment or order"". The Crown had objected to proposed psychiatric evidence on the basis that the offence in question did not require proof of a guilty intent and therefore a defence of mental illness was not available. Greg James J (Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing) referred to R v Adamson and continued:
	


""[10] That decision sat squarely within a long line of authority, which included R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 and R v Neil Joseph Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197, in which latter decision are set out a number of the cases concerning rulings on the admissibility of evidence being held not to found a right of appeal under s 5F(2) or (3). Particularly those cases include: Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253 and Steffan (supra). In Lethlean (supra), the court's attention was drawn to an early seminal case in the High Court of Australia R v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315, concerning what was said to be an error at trial and its ability to be corrected by the High Court. On an application for special leave regard was had to the terms ""judgment or order"" in legislation and in the Constitution. The Court of Criminal Appeal held, consonant with that decision that a ruling on admissibility does not answer the statutory requirements for appeal under section 5F (3).

[11] In R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 the Crown brought an appeal pursuant to s 5F (2) against what were said to be interlocutory judgments or orders, and the court examined, in some detail, the ambit of the term ‘judgment or order’. Allowing for a rare case where a ruling on evidence, which might form the basis of a stay of proceedings, or would have the effect of determining the fate of the prosecution case, as being possibly the subject of a s 5F appeal, the court held that a mere ruling lacks the quality of finally determining the rights of the parties such as to partake of being a judgment or order. It held that it is only where the Crown is effectively refused the opportunity to make a case against a respondent that such a decision is properly to be categorised as a judgment or order coming within the scope of s 5F(2). That decision and the line of authority that was examined in Lethlean (supra) to me makes clear that what occurred here, even though the trial judge was examining the ambit of a legal doctrine possibly applicable, was concerned with the rejection or admission of evidence in the defence case, so that his decision did not fall within any such exception to how rulings on evidence are to be regarded so that the right of appeal for which the Crown contends under s 5F(2) exists.""


	
	On the characteristic of a judgment or order being ""final"" (R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis at 303), senior counsel submitted that there were types of interlocutory judgments or orders that have been found to be amenable to an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) that could be reconsidered during the course of a trial and potentially changed. He cited, as an example, a ruling in respect of a subpoena. The case counsel had in mind was not stated but he mentioned the name of the trial judge, Norrish QC DCJ. A search of Caselaw reveals only one such case meeting that description: KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 186. That case, however, concerned an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3AA) which is not concerned with interlocutory judgments or orders. Another case which did concern an appeal pursuant to s 5F(2) in relation to a subpoena is Attorney General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667. It does not assist the applicants. It concerned a ruling by a magistrate in committal proceedings rejecting a claim of public interest immunity asserted in answer to parts of a subpoena served upon the Commissioner of Police and thereby requiring the Commissioner to produce the documents to the court. Hunt CJ at CL explained (at 673) why the ruling amounted to an interlocutory order:
	


""An order to a stranger to the proceedings that documents be produced to the court following the rejection of a claim of public interest immunity is one which commands the stranger to do something. It may be entered in the court record, and action may be taken upon it in the event that it is disobeyed. For myself, I have no doubt that is an interlocutory order with the meaning of s 5F.""


	
	During the course of submissions, senior counsel found it necessary to concede in response to questioning from the bench that it was open to Johnson J to modify the direction he has indicated he will give to the jury. He contended, however, that this was only a hypothetical possibility. The concession, nonetheless, was fatal.
	


Conclusion


	
	The ruling of Johnson J as to how he would direct the jury as to the meaning of ""mutilates"" for the purposes of an offence in s 45(1)(a) of the Crimes Act is not a judgment. It did not determine the proceedings or an identifiable part of them and is not capable of being entered in the records of the court: R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636. It lacks finality as, at least in theory, it can be changed: R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303. It was in the nature of a ruling on a question of law: Commonwealth v Mullane (1961) 106 CLR 166 at 169.
	
	
	Moreover, what his Honour did was only to outline in very broad terms the nature of the direction he presently proposes that he will give to the jury. The detail of the direction will undoubtedly be formulated and refined in the light of the evidence and submissions in the trial.
	
	
	For these reasons it is abundantly clear, in my respectful view, that the pre-trial ruling as to the meaning of ""mutilates"" in s 45(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and the indication that the judge will direct the jury accordingly is not an interlocutory judgment (or order) that is amenable to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	


Order


	
	It is for the foregoing reasons that I joined in the order of the Court that the application for leave to appeal be refused.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2702852,"Clark, Michael Rex – Application for Inquiry into Conviction and Sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1206","Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Michael Rex Clark applies under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry to be conducted by a judicial officer of the Supreme Court into his conviction on 2 May 2008 for the murder of his father Ernest Dick Clark. In accordance with and for the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that the application should be refused.
	


Background


	
	On 29 April 2005 the applicant’s son Ben Clark fatally shot his grandfather in the rear garden of his home in Bexley. The applicant and his son were both charged with murder. Ben Clark pleaded guilty and was sentenced on 24 September 2007 by Patten AJ to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. The trial of the applicant proceeded before Patten AJ but the jury was ultimately discharged as they were unable to agree.
	
	
	The applicant’s trial was relisted before Kirby J on 11 February 2008. It proceeded for 17 days before it became necessary to discharge the jury.
	
	
	The applicant’s third trial commenced before Kirby J on 10 March 2008. The applicant maintained his plea of not guilty to murder but pleaded guilty to an alternative count of accessory after the fact to murder. The Crown did not accept that plea in discharge of all counts on the indictment. The third trial ran until 2 May 2008 when the applicant was convicted. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 30 years with a non-parole period of 24 years: R v Clark (No 3) [2008] NSWSC 795.
	
	
	The applicant appealed unsuccessfully against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal: Clark v R [2010] NSWCCA 94.
	
	
	On 1 October 2010 the High Court of Australia dismissed an application for special leave to appeal.
	


Introduction


	
	The Crown case was that the applicant had engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with his son pursuant to which his son would murder the deceased when the applicant was well away from the murder scene in order to reduce the chance that the applicant could be accused of an involvement in the crime. Under this arrangement, Ben Clark would be given part of the inheritance that the applicant expected to receive in accordance with the terms of the will of the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown case was circumstantial. It relied upon a number of matters, including evidence of intercepted conversations between the applicant and his son obtained from listening devices. On the Crown case, part of that listening device product included a recording retrieved on 11 July 2005 in which the applicant is said to have referred to a pact between them: “At the start we made a pact … [ind]…in it until the end.”
	
	
	The Crown contended that this material was evidence of the joint criminal enterprise. The original recordings were tendered as evidence in the trial and so were before the jury as exhibits. The words which the Crown contended were spoken on the recordings were transcribed in the usual way and provided to the jury as aides memoire. Although there was some dispute about the accuracy of the transcribed recordings, counsel for the applicant did not relevantly object to the words quoted above. Kirby J gave the jury the usual directions concerning the primacy of the exhibit and the secondary nature of the transcription. These directions withstood scrutiny in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The applicant now wishes to contend that a report dated 5 March 2014 provided by Dr Helen Fraser, a phonetics consultant, is fresh evidence. It takes issue with part of the recording made on 11 July 2005. The applicant submits that Dr Fraser’s report supports the proposition that the quoted words in fact were “At the start …fuckin’ payback”, and that the influence of the erroneous transcription may have been sufficient to have led the jury into error.
	
	
	The Crown opposes the application for an inquiry. The Crown maintains that it was open to the jury to reach its own conclusion as to what the applicant said in fact at the relevant part of the recording, including that it contained the word “pact.” Kirby J himself apparently had no difficulty in discerning what the relevant words were and counsel for the applicant made no complaint about it. That is so notwithstanding that counsel for the applicant did complain during a voir dire with respect to other passages in the recording that were thought to be unclear or indecipherable. Furthermore, the applicant himself used the word “pact” although in the context of asserting that the pact was not to reveal what his son had done.
	
	
	Significantly, the Crown emphasises that Dr Fraser does not say that because she has listened to and examined the recordings at length she is able positively or even confidently to say that the transcription is wrong, or that she has identified the actual but different words that were spoken. According to the Crown, if admissible at all, Dr Fraser’s report means that she is only in the same position of the police officer who transcribed the recording, and who the Court accepted as an ad hoc expert, being someone who listened to it on a number of occasions. Finally, and in any event, the recording contained other incriminating material that supported the Crown case which was not subject to the doubt that the applicant maintains affects the passage in question.
	


The Crown case


	
	The circumstances relied upon by the Crown at trial to prove an agreement between the applicant and his son to kill the deceased were as follows:
	



	
	The applicant was a beneficiary under the will of the deceased and had a motive for wanting him dead.
	
	
	The applicant was in financial difficulties.
	
	
	The applicant was concerned about recent changes in the relationship between the deceased and his partner, which was becoming closer.
	
	
	The applicant was concerned about the amount of money that the deceased was spending upon his partner, including paying for renovations and her mortgage, and the prospect that they were considering buying a business together.
	
	
	The applicant resented his father for the generous way that he treated his partner in contrast to the way that his father treated the applicant when he asked for loans. A Mr Seckold gave evidence, disputed by the applicant, that the applicant described his father as “a tight old prick” who had “more money than he can poke a stick at” and that he wished him dead.
	
	
	On the night of the shooting there was contact by mobile phone between the applicant and his son before and after the murder.
	
	
	Listening device product obtained after the murder included instructions given by the applicant to his son about how to respond to police questioning without linking him to the murder.
	
	
	Part of the conversation recorded on 11 July 2005 included the reference to a “pact” between the applicant and his son. The applicant would pay his son part of the inheritance from the deceased once it was received. The applicant expressed concern that he would forfeit his inheritance if it were established that he had been involved in the murder.
	
	
	The weapon used to kill the deceased was not a homemade weapon as claimed by the applicant’s son, but instead was a handgun.
	
	
	There was no other reasonable explanation for the applicant’s son shooting the deceased: his allegations that he had been sexually assaulted by his grandfather were not credible.
	



	
	Two listening devices had been placed in the applicant’s home on 8 July 2005. Conversations between the applicant and both his wife and his son were recorded. The Crown’s Summary of Trial referred to the listening devices in the following terms:
	


“They were activated and monitored 24 hours a day and recorded on two master tapes. There were two types of conversations, firstly those where members of the family were talking normally that could be heard easily on the listening devices and secondly conversations between Ben Clark and the [applicant] where they were talking to each other in a whisper. The first type of conversation was transcribed and…checked…for accuracy. The whispered conversations were simultaneously recorded on CDs and were sent to technical police and also to some outside agencies where they were enhanced in an attempt to improve the quality. These were listened to a number of times before an initial transcript was served. If he [Detective Sergeant Maree] was unsure or the conversation was indistinct, that was indicated by (ind).”


	
	The Fraser report focuses upon a recording on 11 July 2005 that was tendered at the trial. Detective Sergeant Maree prepared a transcript of the recording after having listened to it a number of times. The transcript was also tendered as an exhibit. It included the words referred to earlier, “Just in case mate. At the start we made a pact…[ind]…in it until the end.”
	
	
	On 19 March 2008, and before the jury received either the recordings or the transcripts, Kirby J gave a direction to the jury regarding the transcripts, which was in the following relevant terms:
	


“Members of the jury, I should say something about the transcripts which you are about to receive. They are sometimes referred to by lawyers as an aide memoire. In other words an aid to you remembering the conversation that you may hear. But it is important that you keep in mind the distinction between the evidence, which is the disk of whatever the particular recording may be. In this case I gather the first one is a telephone intercept, but later on I also gather there will be listening device transcripts. So that is the evidence. The actual recording. And on the other hand the transcript, which is an aide memoire.

The distinction is this: The transcripts are simply someone’s interpretation of what they hear upon the particular recording. Now in some cases there is no controversy about that and, as the detective has said, and as you will hear yourselves, the particular recordings are in some cases very clear. But in other cases there is controversy, or there may be controversy about what actually is on the tape, or what can be heard on the tape. Or in this case, the disk. What you have got to bear in mind is that it is the disk which is the evidence, so you have got to make up your own mind as to what is there.

No doubt you have before you the particular transcript, which is someone’s effort to actually transcribe what they hear. But ultimately it is for you to make up your mind as to what is there, and what you hear collectively in respect of these particular matters, because that is the evidence. The other material is simply something which assists you, especially when you are hearing it for the first time, in really following what is on the recording.

Alright, so bear in mind that distinction. The recording, the disk, is the evidence, which ultimately must be your guide. The transcript is an aide memoire, which you can disagree with entirely if you believe that what you hear on the disk is something different, or if you believe collectively that you cannot hear what is said to be present according to the transcript.”


	
	On 29 April 2008, in his final summing up to the jury, Kirby J provided the following direction:
	


“Before I pass to what the accused says in response to the Crown case let me remind you of something I said at the outset of this trial concerning the transcripts of the listening device recordings, these being an important aspect in the Crown’s circumstantial case. Remember that it is the disks that are the evidence, it is not the transcripts. Admittedly the transcripts are the police version of what was said compiled after listening to those disks many, many, many times but, nonetheless, you must be aware the transcripts are simply an aide memoire, as they are called, or a guide. You ultimately must treat as the evidence the discs and make up your own mind as to what was said.

Michael Clark does not concede the accuracy of the transcripts compiled by the police. Indeed he denies their accuracy in respect of many of them, if not all of them. He does not suggest an alternative version nor is he obliged to, let me tell you, an alternative version based upon his recollection of the conversation or upon his own listening to the conversation. What he does do is point to the many ‘indictincts’ which appear right throughout the transcript, the many ‘dot, dot, dots’ and yet not transcribed. What is said and not transcribed he says, through his counsel, and as a matter of common sense, may affect the meaning.

Now Detective Maree, who prepared many of the transcripts, was cross-examined by Mr Thangaraj as to their accuracy. Indeed his attention was drawn, you will remember, to early versions of the transcripts in certain occasions where the police had served as part of the brief of evidence, which they are obliged to do upon an accused person, what they say was in the transcripts. The earlier version in some cases included a version which was diametrically opposed to the version which was ultimately put forward as the real version. You will remember in one case I think a ‘not’ was left out and that totally changed the meaning, as Detective Maree acknowledged. So obviously this is an aspect of the Crown case which you must approach with some care.”


	
	The approach taken by Kirby J and the direction that he gave are consistent with authority: see R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628 at [177] – [178].
	
	
	At the third trial, Detective Sergeant Maree gave evidence that, for the purpose of preparing relevant transcripts, he had listened to the sound recordings on numerous occasions. He was in those circumstances properly to be regarded as an “ad hoc expert” within the meaning of the authorities: see Butera v DPP (Vic) [1984] HCA 58;(1987) 164 CLR 180 at 188, endorsing the approach of Cooke J in R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 40 at 49; R v Leung [1999] NSWCCA 287; 47 NSWLR 405; Li v R [2003] NSWCCA 290; R v Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167; 65 NSWLR 681 at [120]; R v Drollett [2005] NSWCCA 356 at [63]; R v Marsh [2005] NSWCCA 331 at [32]; Irani v R [2008] NSWCCA 217; Honeysett v R [2014] HCA 29; 253 CLR 122 at [47]-[48].
	


No objection taken at the trial


	
	On 11 February 2008, before the jury was empanelled for the second trial, Kirby J heard legal argument concerning the sound recordings from the listening devices and the transcripts that were prepared by Detective Sergeant Maree. He gave evidence on the voir dire about it. Counsel for the applicant objected to portions of the transcripts on the basis of sound quality, and also relied upon ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. He argued in the alternative that no transcripts should be given to the jury at all. Notably, no objection of any sort was taken to that portion of the recordings or the transcripts that allegedly contained reference to a pact. Indeed, counsel for the applicant said in terms, “I’m not objecting to that portion. The part about the pact. I am not objecting to that.”
	
	
	No different approach was taken at the third trial.
	
	
	It should also be noted that during the voir dire on 11 February 2008, counsel for the applicant advanced a general complaint that the transcript being presented to the jury to accompany the sound recording amounted to a suggestive primer. That submission reflects the contention that underpins the Fraser report. It did not find favour with Kirby J. The applicant did not advance the contention in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Consideration


	
	This application misconceived.
	
	
	In order to succeed the applicant must demonstrate that there is material that would cause me to entertain a sense of unease or disquiet in allowing the applicant’s conviction to stand. An example of material that could possibly fall into that category might include an expert opinion that the transcripts of the relevant recordings were in fact wrong and that this could be convincingly demonstrated. For instance, Dr Fraser might hypothetically have produced a report based upon her examination of the recording using enhanced listening technology that established or suggested that what went to the jury was incorrectly transcribed. In such a case there would be a real risk of injustice to the applicant because the directions given to the jury would not have been adequate in the face of a factual error that would have meant that the aide memoire was not even arguably correct but was on the contrary entirely or at least partially inaccurate and misleading.
	
	
	In the present case what Dr Fraser says is no more than that there is a possibility that the jury were misled because one cannot be certain that the words in question were accurately recorded. In such circumstances the suggested interpretation, in this case provided by Detective Sergeant Maree, may inadvertently and disproportionately have given the transcript an authority or significance that was completely and dangerously unwarranted. This is a phenomenon that Dr Fraser refers to as contextual priming. Dr Fraser points to studies that suggest that seeing an inaccurate transcript can significantly influence a listener’s perception of the audio recording that they might otherwise have interpreted quite differently, or which they might have been content to conclude was so unclear that it could not be sufficiently understood to be interpreted at all.
	
	
	That possibility is however well recognised and is implicitly anticipated by the standard jury directions that were given by Kirby J. In other words, the transcript of the recordings should not be used in substitution for the jury’s own assessment of what the recordings on one view appear to reveal.
	
	
	The burden of Dr Fraser’s report is therefore not that she has identified fresh evidence that indicates or suggests that there was a miscarriage of justice. Rather Dr Fraser is of the opinion that the directions given to the jury in the applicant’s trial were an inappropriate and ineffective mechanism for neutralising the iniquity that she has identified. Indeed, Dr Fraser’s opinion appears to be that the problem is so pervasive that directions of the type ordinarily given to juries in cognate circumstances are patently and fundamentally inadequate for their intended purpose. Dr Fraser effectively posits that an indecipherable audio recording should never be transcribed if there is the slightest chance that contextual priming may corrupt the trial process. She asserts that an improper influence evidently operated upon the minds of the jurors in the applicant’s trial because the portions of the audio in question could not be unambiguously interpreted or transcribed. Dr Fraser contends that no transcription can or should be relied upon, and should not be provided to a jury, where the audio is not clear because of the associated possibility of a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	There is no doubt that these concerns are important. They do not however amount to fresh evidence. The directions given to the jury were standard directions intended as far as possible to focus the attention of the jurors upon the distinction between the evidence on the one hand and aids to its interpretation on the other hand. None of Dr Fraser’s interesting and compelling analyses causes me to entertain any sense of unease or disquiet that might not otherwise be generated in every criminal trial by the prospect that jurors may not understand or apply directions that are given to them by the trial judge. That is an ever present but different issue to the issue proffered by the applicant in this case based upon Dr Fraser’s report.
	
	
	The circumstantial Crown case against the applicant was otherwise strong and compelling. This has been referred to already. Significantly for present purposes, the 11 July 2005 recording contained other incriminating material. It is clear from this material that the applicant was providing instructions to his son concerning how he should respond to questioning by the police in a way that did not link the applicant to the crime. The conversation includes reference to the money that the applicant anticipated he would receive from the estate of the deceased and that the money would still be waiting for the applicant’s son if he were sent to gaol.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my opinion the application should be dismissed. I am not led to entertain any sense of unease or disquiet that the applicant was or may have been improperly convicted. He has pointed to no fresh evidence or to any factor that was not available to be utilised or relied upon in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

	GLEESON JA:  I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to the sentence imposed on the Respondent, Calvyn John Wood, at the Parramatta District Court on 10 December 2014.
	
	
	The Respondent had pleaded guilty on 1 May 2014 to one count of possessing child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 10 years with no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	His Honour Judge Williams SC sentenced the Respondent to imprisonment for two years and nine months commencing 10 December 2014 and expiring on 9 September 2017 with a non-parole period of 12 months.
	
	
	The Crown’s sole ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed on the Respondent was manifestly inadequate.
	


Background Facts


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered in the District Court. Except where otherwise indicated, what follows is drawn from that statement.
	
	
	On 18 December 2012, a search warrant was executed at a three bedroom town house rented by Grantly Leroy Morris (“Morris”) in North Parramatta. The Respondent rented a bedroom from Morris on the upper level within the townhouse. A large number of items, including desktop computers, external portable hard drives, compact discs, thumb drives and digital video cameras were seized during the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	Investigators conducted a preliminary examination of external portable hard drives belonging to the Respondent and subsequently identified a substantial amount of child abuse material on three of those portable hard drives.
	
	
	Between 12 February 2013 and 15 February 2013, a forensic review was conducted at the New South Wales Police State Electronic Evidence Branch on the electronic equipment belonging to both Morris and the Respondent which was seized during the search warrant.
	
	
	A total of 755,249 picture images and 17,299 video files were identified during the forensic review on the three computer towers and three portable hard drives belonging to the Respondent.
	
	
	The Child Exploitation Tracking System (“CETS”) Scale was used to classify a random sample of material seized from the Respondent.
	
	
	The CETS Scale classifies child abuse material into the following categories:
	



	
	Category 1 – Depictions of children with no sexual activity (nudity, sexually suggestive posing, explicit emphasis on genital areas).
	
	
	Category 2 – Non-penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child (explicit sexual activity not involving an adult).
	
	
	Category 3 – Non-penetrative sexual activity between child(ren) and adult(s) (mutual masturbation and other non-penetrative sexual activity).
	
	
	Category 4 – Penetrative sexual activity involving child(ren) or both child(ren) and adult(s) (including, but not limited to, intercourse, cunnilingus and fellatio).
	
	
	Category 5 – Sadism or bestiality (sexual imagery involving pain, humiliation or animals).
	
	
	Category 6 – Animation/cartoon/CGI depicting CETS scales 1-5 (any animation, cartoon, drawing or computer generated imagery depicting and of the CETS scales 1-5).
	


Material Found on the Respondent’s Computer Towers


	
	Three computer towers belonging to the Respondent were examined. Two computer towers contained images of prepubescent boys, aged between approximately six and 12 years, with different children depicted in each image. The remaining computer tower contained computer generated images of prepubescent male children.
	
	
	Details of those computer towers and the material they contained are as follows:
	



	
	Dell Tower PC – A Dell tower PC was found to contain a total of 240,441 images. A random sample was selected and of this, 9,600 images were sample examined and 58 picture files were selected from the sample. Those picture files were classified according to the CETS Scale (described at [12] above) and contained 45 Category 1 images, five Category 2 images, five Category 3 images, and three Category 4 images. There were no images falling within Categories 5 or 6.
	
	
	Antec PC Tower Drive – An Antec PC Tower drive was found to contain a total of 22,475 picture files and 2,267 video files. Of those files, 5,153 picture files and 60 video files were sample examined. Of the picture files, 222 fell within Category 1, 32 within Category 2, 12 within Category 3, and 34 within Category 4. There were no picture files falling within Categories 5 or 6. Of the video files, eight fell within Category 1, nine within Category 2, six within Category 3 and eight within Category 4. There were no video files falling within Categories 5 or 6.
	
	
	MP Media Pro Tower PC – An MP Media Pro Tower PC was found to contain a total of 2,477 computer generated images. Fifty-five of those images were found to contain Category 6 child abuse material.
	


Material Found on the Respondent’s External Hard Drives


	
	Three external hard drives belonging to the Respondent were also examined. Each hard drive contained images of prepubescent boys, aged between approximately six and 12 years, with different children depicted in each image.
	
	
	Details of those external hard drives and the material they contained are as follows:
	



	
	Western Digital External Hard Drive (1) - A Western Digital external hard drive was found to contain a total of 18,486 picture files and 23 video files. Of those files, 854 picture files and 11 video files were sample examined. The sample picture files revealed 222 Category 1 files, 31 Category 2 files, 11 Category 3 files, 35 Category 4 files, and one Category 5 file. Of the sample video files, there were nine Category 1 videos and two Category 3 videos. None of the sample videos fell within Categories 2, 4, 5 or 6.
	
	
	Western Digital External Hard Drive (2) – Another Western Digital external hard drive was found to contain a total of 220,424 picture files and 4,261 video files. Of those files, 3,643 picture files and 211 video files were sample examined. The sample picture files revealed 230 Category 1 files, 30 Category 2 files, 15 Category 3 files, and 25 Category 4 files. Of the video files, there were 26 Category 1 videos, 13 Category 2 videos, eight Category 3 videos, and 21 Category 4 videos. None of the sample videos fell within Categories 5 or 6.
	
	
	Seagate USB External Hard Drive – A Seagate external hard drive was found to contain a total of 250,946 picture files and 6,748 video files. Of those files 2,500 picture files and 650 video files were sample examined. The sample picture files revealed 219 Category 1 files, 39 Category 2 files, 19 Category 3 files, and 23 Category 4 files. None of the sample picture files fell within Categories 5 or 6. Of the sample video files, there were eight Category 1 videos, nine Category 2 videos, six Category 3 videos, 21 Category 4 videos, two Category 5 videos and no Category 6 videos.
	



	
	The forensic review of the material also indicated that the three external hard drives contained “back-ups” of the child abuse material that were stored on the three desk top computer towers. In addition, the files had been categorised into folders with references including “trading file”, “chat docs”, “administrator”, and “XXXX”.
	
	
	In total, applying statistical sampling pursuant to s.289B Criminal Procedure Act 1986, using the lowest figure in the range, the Respondent would have had in his possession across all of the six devices analysed, approximately 49,433 picture images and 2,175 videos containing child abuse material: Crown Submissions on Appeal at [9].
	


The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Respondent was 62 years of age at the time of sentence.
	
	
	His criminal history involved three offences of indecent assault and one offence of procuring an act of indecency against the same victim, a male under the age of 16, between 1977 and 1982 (when the victim was aged between eight and 12 years). After trial, he was sentenced at the Parramatta District Court on 20 February 1992 to a total effective term of imprisonment for two years and eight months, with a non-parole period of two years.
	
	
	Before the sentencing court were a presentence report dated 21 August 2014 prepared by a Community Corrections Officer and a report dated 7 August 2014 of Delphine Bostock, Forensic Psychologist, bearing on the subjective circumstances of the Respondent.
	
	
	The presentence report documented a number of matters, including the Respondent’s disadvantaged and emotionally insecure upbringing and his lengthy history of depressive illness and social isolation. He was in receipt of the Disability Support Pension, granted to him in 2008, for a long-standing back complaint and poor mental health. The report noted that the Respondent appeared to lack an appreciation of the impact that child pornography has on children and that he denied deliberately seeking access to child abuse material for sexual gratification. The report also noted that the Respondent would be eligible for a custodial sex offender program if sentenced to imprisonment and that a minimum of two years would be needed for that purpose.
	
	
	The report of Ms Bostock recorded the Respondent’s denial that he used child pornography for masturbation but that he felt compelled to categorise the material he had downloaded. The report also recorded the Respondent’s lack of insight into his offending, noting that he did not “see the pain, that they were being hurt” and that he was instead searching for signs of happiness in the children. Ms Bostock also indicated that a minimum of two years would be needed to complete a custodial sex offender program.
	


Proceedings in the District Court and Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Respondent pleaded guilty to the present offence on 1 May 2014 at Parramatta Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence.
	
	
	He came before his Honour Judge Williams SC at the Parramatta District Court on 10 December 2014.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing, documentary material was provided to the Court, including agreed facts, the Respondent’s criminal and custodial history, a presentence report (to which reference has been made), file paths indicating the manner in which some of the child abuse material had been stored, Crown written submissions, a report from Ms Bostock (to which reference has been made) and a statistical analysis report with respect to the material found in the Respondent’s possession and relevant sentencing statistics.
	
	
	The Respondent gave evidence at the hearing. Whilst giving evidence, the Respondent accepted (apparently for the first time) that at least some of the children depicted in the photographs had been harmed (T42/AB187).
	
	
	Following the hearing, the sentencing Judge proceeded to deliver ex tempore remarks on sentence.
	
	
	After a relatively lengthy summary of the agreed facts, the findings of the presentence report and the report of Ms Bostock, and the submissions of both the Crown and the defence, his Honour proceeded to make findings.
	
	
	His Honour took into account “as a very significant matter the question of general deterrence” (ROS9/AB14) and noted that the Respondent’s previous convictions could not be a factor which entitled the Respondent to any leniency on sentence (ROS10/AB15).
	
	
	His Honour found (ROS10-11/AB15-16):
	


“Notwithstanding that the offender had taken no apparent opportunity to seek counselling or treatment in the last 18 months and that the Crown asserts that his prospects are therefore guarded of achieving any realistic rehabilitation his evidence before me today has impressed upon me that he has, albeit belatedly, come to a recognition that his condition is one which needs treatment and I have some hope that treatment will lead him away from any further reoffending. I would assess his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded but not to be dismissed out of hand.”


	
	His Honour went on to say (ROS11/AB16):
	


“Mr Karim ultimately submitted that a finding of special circumstances should be made if a custodial sentence was imposed and the factors which he put and which accept [sic] which justify such a finding include his age, his need for strict protection in custody which can be inferred and the extent of his physical disability and the extent of his mental illness, albeit that it is not the subject of current specific treatment.

In the light of the material that I have summarised and the submissions to which I have referred I find that the offender’s criminal conduct falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness and that he is entitled to a finding of special circumstances.”


	
	In sentencing the Respondent, his Honour found (ROS11/AB16):
	


“I am simply unable in the light of the statements in the authorities and the subjective and objective features of this case to do other than impose a period of full-time imprisonment and I therefore do not accept Mr Karim’s suggestion that a suspended sentence of two years is appropriate.” 


	
	A 25% discount was allowed for the utilitarian value of the Respondent’s guilty plea.
	
	
	The practical effect of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances was to vary substantially the statutory ratio of 75% prescribed by s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to about 36%.
	


Principles Applicable to Sentencing for Child Pornography Offences


	
	This Court has recently had cause to consider the principles that apply with respect to sentencing for child pornography offences (R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174; R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183).
	
	
	In R v De Leeuw, the Court reiterated the following principles (at [72]):
	


“72   Appellate courts throughout Australia have consistently stated that the following propositions apply to sentencing for child pornography offences:

(a)   Unless exceptional circumstances exist, a sentence involving an immediate term of imprisonment is ordinarily warranted: R v Jongsma [2004] VSCA 218; 150 A Crim R 386 at 395 [14]; Hill v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 4 at [28]; R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [48]; R v Sykes [2009] QCA 267 at [24]; DPP v Groube [2010] VSCA 150 at [24]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro [2010] VSCA 60; 26 VR 477 at 483-4 [21]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Guest [2014] VSCA 29 at [23]-[24]; DPP v Smith [2010] VSCA 215 at [23], [26]-[29].

(b)   The objective seriousness of the offending is ordinarily determined by reference to the following factors:

(i)   the nature and content of the material, in particular the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity depicted;

(ii)   the number of items or images possessed;

(iii)   whether the material is for the purpose of sale or further distribution;

(iv)   whether the offender will profit from the offence;

(v)      in the case of possession or access of child pornography for personal use, the number of children depicted and thereby victimised;

(vi)   the length of time for which the pornographic material was possessed: R v Jongsma at 400 [28]; R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at 49 [99]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; DPP (Cth) v Guest at [25].

(c)   General deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration for offending involving child pornography: Assheton v R [2002] WASCA 209; 132 A Crim R 237 at 246-247 [35]-[36]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; Edwards v The Queen [2013] VSCA 188 at [22]; DPP (Cth) v Guest at [25]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R [2014] VSCA 37 at [40]; DPP (Cth) v Zarb [2014] VSCA 347 at [34].

(d)   Less or limited weight is given to an offender’s prior good character: R v Gent at 44 [65]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181 at [37].

(e)   Offending involving child pornography occurs on an international level and is becoming increasingly prevalent with the advent of the Internet as a means of allowing people to access and obtain child pornography: R v Jones [1999] WASCA 24; 108 A Crim R 50 at 51 [2]; Assheton v R at 246-247 [35]-[36].

(f)   Offending involving child pornography is difficult to detect given the anonymity provided by the Internet: Mouscas v R at [31]; R v Booth at [29].

(g)   The possession of child pornography material creates a market for the continued corruption and exploitation of children: R v Coffey [2003] VSCA 155; 6 VR 543 at 552 [30]; R v Cook; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2004] QCA 469 at [21]; R v Jongsma at 395 [14]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R at [40].

(h)   There is a paramount public interest objective in promoting the protection of children as the possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime - children are sexually abused in order to supply the market: R v Jones at 52 [9]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 484 [23].

(i)   The fact that an offender does not pay to access a child pornography website or was not involved in the distribution or sale of child pornography does not mitigate the offending: R v Coffey at 552 [30].”


	
	As the authorities emphasise, the possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime. Not only is a child sexually abused in order to produce the material, harm is also occasioned by virtue of the material remaining in circulation, in effect compounding the original abuse and further degrading the victim: R v Porte at [69]-[70].
	
	
	Sentences imposed for offences contrary to s.91H must reflect the increase in maximum penalty in 2008 from five years to 10 years’ imprisonment. Further, as the authorities consistently make clear, the ready availability of child abuse material has warranted substantial penalties with general deterrence and denunciation being paramount considerations: R v Porte at [59], [62].
	
	
	Although R v Porte and R v De Leeuw concerned sentencing for a mixture of Commonwealth and State child pornography offences, the propositions set out above are applicable to sentencing for a s.91H offence and will be borne in mind in the determination of the present appeal.
	


The Ground of Appeal – Claim of Manifest Inadequacy

Submissions


	
	The Crown’s claim of manifest inadequacy is said to arise out of a deficiency in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and a failure to turn his mind properly to general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	In essence, the Crown submission is that the sentencing Judge provided no real analysis of general and specific deterrence, and provided little account of a number of matters that went to the objective seriousness of the offending, including specific matters which were the subject of submissions at the hearing. As a result, the Crown submits, a manifestly inadequate sentence was imposed.
	
	
	In particular, the Crown submits that his Honour ought to have adverted to a number of specific matters, including that (applying statistical sampling) there would have been about 4,819 Category 4 images and 697 Category 4 video file pictures on the Respondent’s devices, the large number of victims depicted, the significant abuse involved, and the fact that the Respondent had collected the material over a period of 15 years.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the sentence imposed, both the head sentence and the 12 month non-parole period, was manifestly inadequate even accepting a finding of special circumstances with respect to the non-parole period.
	
	
	The Respondent submits that the starting point for the head sentence of three years and eight months before application of the 25% utilitarian discount was not self-evidently “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. Particularly in light of the Crown submission in the District Court that the offending fell within the mid to upper range of objective seriousness, the Respondent submits that his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was open.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown submission that the sentencing Judge failed to turn his mind to general and specific deterrence, the Respondent points to his Honour’s mention of general sentencing principles and the fact that general deterrence was specifically taken into account by his Honour as a “very significant matter”.
	
	
	With respect to the non-parole period imposed, the Respondent submits that there is nothing inherently erroneous in a ratio of 36% and points to a number of authorities as well as statistics from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in support of that proposition. The Respondent submits that the present case was one in which an extended period of release on parole was desirable.
	


Decision


	
	The Crown’s claim of manifest inadequacy is founded on an alleged failure to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence and a failure to properly consider the question of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	It should be borne in mind from the outset that his Honour’s remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing and due allowance must be made for that circumstance: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 577 [48].
	
	
	In order for the Crown to make good its claim of manifest inadequacy, it must satisfy this Court that the sentencing Judge’s discretion miscarried in the sense that the sentence imposed was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistent with sentencing standards: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at 588 [24]. In other words, it must be shown that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].
	
	
	Of course it is well established that, absent error, this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-478.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case, I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge erred in the manner submitted by the Crown. His Honour clearly had regard to the objective seriousness of the offending and made findings in respect of that factor, took into account the importance of general deterrence as a “very significant matter” (ROS9/AB14) and made an assessment concerning the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge’s failure to mention specific matters adverted to by the Crown (outlined at [43] above) does not of itself demonstrate that his Honour did not properly exercise his sentencing discretion with respect to the head sentence. Failing to advert to a given factor or factors relevant to the sentencing discretion in the context of an ex tempore judgment should not too readily be assumed to reveal oversight: PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 at [46].
	
	
	To the extent that the Crown challenges the sentencing Judge’s characterisation that this offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness, I do not accept that submission. It was open to the sentencing Judge to make such a finding.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the head sentence imposed on the Respondent of imprisonment for two years and nine months was manifestly inadequate in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The matters articulated by the sentencing Judge in support of the finding of special circumstances (see [32] above) provided no reasonable foundation for a very substantial variation of the statutory ratio from 75% to about 36%. The factors recited were no doubt taken into account in determining the head sentence. Double counting of factors should be guarded against, although some overlap may be warranted: R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [102]-[107].  His Honour’s referral of the Respondent for assessment by Corrective Services for participation in a custodial sex offender program, despite evidence that a minimum of two years in custody would be required for that purpose, added a further complication in understanding the rationale for the orders made.
	
	
	It is settled principle that the adjustment of the statutory ratio, after considering factors relevant to the fettered discretion, must lead to the imposition of a non-parole period which constitutes the minimum period which an offender should spend in custody having regard to all objective and subjective circumstances, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 718 [65]; R v GWM at [118].
	
	
	The non-parole period should constitute the least period which the Respondent ought be required to serve for his crime before being eligible for parole, having regard to all the purposes of punishment and not simply his rehabilitation: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36]: R v GWM at [118].
	
	
	In Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247, this Court said (at [28]):
	


“… the reduction of the non-parole period by a finding of special circumstances cannot result in an overall non-parole period that fails to reflect the seriousness of the offence and both specific and general deterrence”.


	
	As the authorities consistently make clear, when sentencing for child pornography offences general deterrence and denunciation are the primary considerations (see [39] above).
	
	
	It is appropriate to note some features concerning the objective gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge found that the offence lay within the mid-range of objective seriousness. This finding was open to his Honour. The Respondent was to be sentenced for a single “rolled-up” charge under s.91H: R v De Leeuw at [116]. The significant volume of child abuse material in his possession rendered this a serious s.91H offence, albeit within the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Respondent had prior convictions for sexual offences committed against a boy between 1977 and 1982, for which sentences of imprisonment were imposed. The Respondent had not demonstrated insight into his offending nor fully acknowledged the harm done to the children depicted in the child abuse material. These aspects did not assist the Respondent in the fixing of a non-parole period.
	
	
	In my view, the very substantial level of variation from the statutory ratio in the present case has resulted in the imposition of a non-parole period that clearly fails to reflect the objective gravity of the offending and the heightened need for general deterrence in sentencing for this class of offences.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the non-parole period of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed on the Respondent was manifestly inadequate. The Crown has demonstrated error in this respect.
	


Should the Discretion to Resentence the Respondent be Exercised?


	
	Having established manifest inadequacy with respect to the non-parole period imposed on the Respondent, the Crown must demonstrate that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised: CMB v Attorney General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407 at 415 [33].
	
	
	Mr Odgers SC, counsel for the Respondent, read the affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 20 May 2015, to be taken into account on the exercise of the residual discretion and resentencing.
	
	
	The Respondent’s affidavit documents his shock and anxiety upon learning of the Crown appeal as well as a number of health complaints that appear to have been exacerbated by his time in prison.
	
	
	The Crown appeal in this case was filed without delay and although the Crown did not wish to be heard on the question of special circumstances in the District Court, in light of the very significant deviation from the statutory ratio, I do not consider that this operates adversely to the Crown on appeal. There is no other aspect of the Crown’s conduct in the District Court that would operate adversely to the Crown.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the non-parole period imposed in this case clearly fails to reflect the objective gravity of the offending and the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for child pornography offences.
	
	
	As a result, I am satisfied that this Court should intervene by imposing a non-parole period that adequately reflects the gravity of the offending in this case.
	


Resentencing the Respondent


	
	In resentencing the Respondent, it is appropriate to take into account the evidence before the District Court and the additional evidence before this Court.
	
	
	The Crown challenge to the head sentence of two years and nine months’ imprisonment has not succeeded. The Respondent’s subjective circumstances (including his age, health and conditions of custody) were taken into account in determination of the head sentence.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances is appropriate, in particular to allow for a modest additional period of supervised conditional liberty. A non-parole period of one year and 10 months should be fixed (being about 66% of the head sentence). This is the minimum period the Respondent should spend in custody having regard to all the circumstances of the case: R v Simpson at 718 [65].
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Crown appeal allowed;
	
	
	sentence imposed upon the Respondent on 10 December 2014 is set aside;
	
	
	in its place, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year and 10 months commencing on 10 December 2014 and expiring on 9 October 2016, with a balance of term of 11 months commencing on 10 October 2016 and expiring on 9 September 2017;
	
	
	for the purpose of s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1996, the Respondent is to be released to parole on 10 October 2016.
	



	
	GARLING J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J, for the reasons which he gives.

		28 August 2015",2015-08-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702860,Mun v R [2015] NSWCCA 234,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Steven Mun, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court by Frearson DCJ on 5 June 2014.
	
	
	On 11 March 2014, the applicant pleaded guilty to a single offence of armed robbery with wounding contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), namely:
	


That Steven MUN on the 15th day of November 2013, at SYDNEY, in the State of New South Wales, did rob Sang Ki KANG of certain property, to wit, a beige handbag containing $7000 cash, the property of Sang Ki KANG and immediately before did wound the said Sang Ki KANG whilst being then armed with an offensive instrument, to wit, a claw hammer.


	
	The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act is 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by his Honour was 7 years to commence on 15 November 2013, with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on the same date and expiring on 14 November 2017.
	
	
	The proposed grounds of appeal are that his Honour wrongly found there was no evidence of contrition and that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Relevant facts


	
	The applicant did not give evidence on the sentencing hearing. His Honour proceeded upon the basis of a statement of agreed facts. In outline, the circumstances of the offending were as follows.
	
	
	At about 2.50pm on 15 November 2013, the applicant entered the Interville Technology Café in World Square Sydney and purchased an hour of internet access. About an hour later he purchased another hour of access, and at 4.30pm he purchased a further 3 hours access. He was described by a witness as behaving normally during this period.
	
	
	At about 7pm, the victim, Mr Kang (the proprietor of the money exchange section of the café), prepared the cash takings in preparation for closing up. He put around $7000 in a shoulder bag. The applicant got up and put on a pair of gloves. He followed the complainant out of the café and without making any demand repeatedly struck him on the head with a claw hammer. The applicant took the bag and ran out of the store. He was pursued by several bystanders and apprehended a short distance away.
	
	
	Police arrived shortly afterwards and arrested and cautioned the applicant. When asked where the hammer was, the applicant replied “It’s in the store still”. Police found the hammer lying on the ground inside the café near the door.
	
	
	The victim sustained wounds to his head that required suturing with staples, swelling to the jaw and multiple bruises.
	
	
	When police examined the applicant's mobile phone, they found a series of text messages from 2.50pm onwards that indicated that the applicant was lying in wait for the victim and had an accomplice. The co-offender was not apprehended.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	At the time of the sentence, the applicant had been in custody for nearly 7 months (since his arrest on 15 November 2013). The applicant was aged 18 at the time of the offence, was aged 19 at the time of sentence and is presently aged 20 years.
	
	
	The materials before the sentencing judge included a pre-sentence report from Community Corrections and a psychologist’s report from Ms Johnson.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report outlined the applicant’s family and social circumstances. The applicant grew up in a family afflicted by domestic violence and his parents separated when he was about 10 years old. He had started using alcohol, cannabis and ice at the age of 15. The applicant attended High School until the middle of year 11, when he began a welding course at TAFE. Mr Mun was halfway through his third year of his four year TAFE course at the time of the offending. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had left his employment with an engineering firm approximately one month before the offence. He claimed that he was at the stage of either “resign or be fired” owing to his lack of reliability, which he attributed mainly as a result of his illicit drug use.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report noted (at page 2) under the heading “Attitude to the offending” that the applicant stated that he had no income, had run out of money and planned the robbery. The report further noted that the applicant stated that “he ‘feels bad’ for the victim and was relieved he did not receive more serious injuries”. The report concluded (at page 3) under the heading “Assessment” that “whilst [the applicant] has expressed his relief the victim did not suffer a more dire outcome, it is a point of disquiet he did not think of consequences beforehand”.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report stated that the applicant:
	


has shown considerable contrition regarding his actions and is highly motivated to turn his life around once released. He has reported feeling embarrassed and foolish at his actions and is aware he will need to work hard in the future to regain the trust of his family and girlfriend.


	
	Before the sentencing Judge, the applicant’s legal representative pointed to the plea of guilty and submitted that the applicant had expressed his remorse in the psychologist’s report, and to the author of the pre-sentence report (tcpt 5/6/14 at 14, lines 33-44). His Honour observed that so far as he could see on the materials, the applicant only expressed relief that the victim was not more seriously injured but had not expressed any remorse about being involved in an armed robbery. The applicant’s representative agreed with this view of the evidence and did not take his Honour to any part of the tendered materials as supporting the submission which had been made on remorse (tcpt 5/6/14 at 14, line 46 – 15, line 3).
	


The judge’s reasons


	
	After summarising the statement of agreed facts and noting that he had viewed the CCTV footage of the incident, the judge concluded, beyond reasonable doubt, that the victim was struck to the head at least twice with the hammer. His Honour found that the wounding involved the brutal application of force with the hammer, that the attack was calculated and sustained (ROS 5).
	
	
	His Honour found that the offending involved a considerable level of planning (because the applicant knew the business where the robbery was committed, had brought with him both gloves and the hammer, and had waited inside for a period of time before he could effect his purpose). His Honour considered that the applicant’s text messages to his accomplice also indicated a level of planning (ROS 9).
	
	
	The judge found that objectively the offence was in the “mid-range somewhere” (ROS 5). Later his Honour described the offence as “a mid range offence and a very serious offence” (ROS 11).
	
	
	The judge considered the applicant’s subjective case, taking into account the pre-sentence report and the psychologist’s report, which he referred to in some detail in his reasons.
	
	
	His Honour noted the assessment in the pre-sentence report that the applicant had committed the offence under the influence of “ice” and was motivated by his need to finance his addiction (ROS 6). Although noting that the applicant had expressed his relief to the author of the pre-sentence report that the victim did not suffer a more dire outcome, his Honour considered that he did not actually see any indication of remorse in relation to the armed robbery offence at all (ROS 7).
	
	
	His Honour noted the psychologist’s assessment that although the applicant experienced low self-esteem he had no mental disorder or psychological dysfunction (ROS 8).
	
	
	His Honour also accepted that, to some extent, the fact that the applicant was apparently under the influence of drugs may have caused him to act somewhat out of character. Against this, his Honour found, as already indicated, that there was some planning involved in the offence and that the drug explanation did not apply equally in relation to all the phases of the planning (ROS 9).
	
	
	In finding the applicant had not shown remorse, his Honour said:
	


Has the offender shown any remorse for the armed robbery?

I think none whatsoever.

It is true that the plea itself can be some manifestation of remorse but I consider realistically here it is not. The plea is some acceptance of responsibility but there is no evidence of remorse for the armed robbery. (ROS 10)


	
	His Honour found that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were fairly good and that he was unlikely to reoffend in this serious manner (ROS 10).
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances was made on the basis that the applicant will require assistance upon his release for his illicit drug substance abuse (ROS 11).
	
	
	After allowing for the 25% discount for the plea of guilty, his Honour imposed the sentence already mentioned above.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in his finding that the applicant did not express any remorse in his offending

Applicant’s submissions


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in stating that there was no evidence of remorse for the armed robbery. It was contended that the psychologist’s report was an acceptable way for evidence of remorse to be provided, despite the applicant not having given evidence. Reference was made to Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [16]ff.
	
	
	It was also contended that the applicant had expressed his contrition for what he had visited upon the victim in the statements recorded in the pre-sentence report where the applicant expressed his relief that the victim was not more seriously injured.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that self-serving, untested, out of court statements made by offenders to third parties should be treated with great circumspection and given very little weight. Reference was made to R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at [58]-[59] (Smart AJ; Spigelman CJ agreeing); Pfitzner v R [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [33]; Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; 209 A Crim R 297 at [65]; Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 at [33].
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that the determination of whether or the extent to which an offender has shown remorse is a question of fact that quintessentially falls to the sentencing judge. The Crown also emphasised, in this context, that a sentencing judge is not bound to accept assertions by an offender that he or she is remorseful, even when that assertion is made in the witness box: Alvares v R; Farache v R at [65].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence of remorse in the present case was so limited as to be inconsequential, and that his Honour’s finding of no remorse was well open on the evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act) provides that remorse shown by the offender for the offence is to be taken into account as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentence, but only if:
	


(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions, or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both). [Emphasis added.]


	
	The onus of establishing remorse as a mitigating factor lies with the applicant, on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [25]-[27].
	
	
	This Court has previously said that statements made by an offender to an expert, such as the psychologist Ms Johnson, or to the author of the pre-sentence report, which are not supported by the offender giving sworn evidence, should be treated with considerable caution and in many cases are of very little, if any, weight: R v Qutami at [58] (Smart AJ; Spigelman CJ agreeing).
	
	
	The applicant’s reliance on the decision of this Court in Butters v R does not really assist him. Butters v R at [16] is authority that s 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act does not require an offender to give evidence before a finding of remorse is available. That is, the requirement of s 21A(3)(i) to provide evidence before remorse can be relied upon does not equate with a requirement that an offender give evidence either of remorse generally or of the matters set out in the section. Nonetheless, in Butters v R at [18] it was accepted that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account the fact that the offender did not give evidence. Further, it was acknowledged that this approach is consistent with this Court cautioning against an uncritical reliance on material contained in tendered reports (or other third party statements) for evidentiary purposes where an offender has not given evidence. Reference was made to R v Qutami.
	
	
	As McClellan CJ at CL subsequently explained in Pfitzner v R at [33], with reference to Butters v R:
	


… it does not follow that if an offender does not give evidence and accordingly is not exposed to cross-examination that the sentencing judge may not give significant weight to the lack of evidence from the offender when determining whether a finding of remorse should be made.


	
	In this context it has been said that the assessment of the genuineness of remorse is likely to be better informed in circumstances in which it is expressed directly, as remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon human interaction: Alvares v R; Farache v R at [44] (Buddin J; McClellan CJ and CL and Schmidt J agreeing).
	
	
	This Court recently observed that the practice of offenders relying on hearsay statements for findings of fact in their favour is not uncommon, notwithstanding this Court’s remarks, and emphasised that the practice is not to be encouraged: Halac v R [2015] NSWCCA 121 at [106] (Garling J; Hoeben CJ at CL and Hall J agreeing). This is not to misstate the law with respect to s 21A(3)(i): cf Butters v R at [16]. Rather it is to emphasise the considerable caution this Court has expressed with respect to the weight, if any, which can be placed on self-serving and untested statements by an offender in tendered reports.
	
	
	Here it was well open to his Honour to find that the applicant had not shown remorse.
	
	
	The statement in the psychologist’s report that the applicant had shown considerable contrition regarding his actions was a conclusionary opinion, the basis for which was left largely unexplained in the report. The psychologist recorded that the applicant felt embarrassed and foolish at his actions. Other than this statement, there is no reference in the report to the psychologist having discussed with the applicant the facts giving rise to the offending. The self-serving and untested statement of the applicant’s regret for his embarrassing and foolish actions did not squarely address whether he accepted responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	Nor did the statement recorded in the pre-sentence report that the applicant had acknowledged the injury caused to the victim (being the second requirement in s 21A(3)(i)), amount to an acceptance of responsibility for his actions (the first requirement in s 21A(3)(i)). Rather than accept responsibility, the applicant sought to explain away his actions to the author of that report. The applicant described his actions as being the result of having no income, that he had run out money, and that he was under the influence of “ice” and “not thinking straight”.
	
	
	In my view, in the absence of evidence from the applicant himself, his Honour was entitled to treat the material relied upon by the applicant as inconsequential and give no weight to that material. The difference in an ex-tempore judgment between the evidence being described as inconsequential and of no weight and his Honour’s finding that there was no evidence of remorse for the armed robbery, does not amount to error.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2: The sentence was manifestly excessive

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant’s submissions on this ground were concise. Counsel for the applicant calculated that with the 25% discount for the early plea of guilty there must have been a “starting point” for the head sentence of 9 years 4 months. Relying upon the observations of Simpson J in TYN v R [2009] NSWCCA 146; 195 A Crim R 345 at [33]-[34], it was submitted that it was appropriate to focus on the notional “starting point” for the sentence. The applicant submitted that the starting point was too high, particularly having regard to his Honour’s finding of mid-range objective seriousness, the standard non-parole period of 7 years and the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 (Henry).
	
	
	With respect to the relevance of the Henry guideline, counsel referred to the subsequent observations of Howie J (Simpson and Hislop JJ agreeing) in R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [34]-[35]. There, Howie J said (at [35]) that the Henry guideline although dealing with an offence under s 97, still represents a guide to the sentencing for related offences, such as an offence under s 98, even though that offence carries a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant next submitted that taking the Henry guideline of 4 to 5 years for the total sentence for an offence under s 97 (20 years imprisonment), the “starting point” or nominal sentence in relation to the applicant of 9 years and 4 months is too high for the offence under s 98 (25 years imprisonment), because the maximum penalty under s 98 is proportionally only 25% higher than the maximum penalty under s 97.
	
	
	In oral argument, counsel pointed to the statistics for s 98 offences between January 2008 and December 2014, which indicated that there had only been eight cases involving an offender with no prior offences and a guilty plea, of which only three cases involved an offender aged 18 to 20 years, and that only one young offender had been sentenced to imprisonment in that period. Counsel relied upon these statistics as indicating that there were very few cases in the relevant period answering the criteria comparable with the applicant. Counsel submitted that this highlighted how unusual the present case was.
	


Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that it was erroneous to focus on the “starting point” of the undiscounted sentence being too high, because this deflected attention from the proper question, namely, whether the sentence actually imposed was unreasonable. Reference was made to the observations of Hoeben CJ at CL in Adzioski v R [2013] NSWCCA 69 at [72]. See also Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [40]; and Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49; 219 A Crim R 550.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging the limited reliance which may be placed on sentencing statistics, the Crown pointed to the statistics for s 98 offences which indicated that a head sentence of 7 years or more was imposed in 40% of sentences between January 2008 and December 2014, and the non-parole period of 4 years or more was imposed in 34% of cases.
	
	
	The Crown also drew attention to the circumstances of the offence, including that it involved an unprovoked, planned and brutal attack by the applicant with a hammer on a vulnerable shopkeeper. The Crown submitted that no adequate explanation had been provided by the applicant for why he attacked the victim in this manner. The Crown further submitted that the applicant’s subjective case did not mitigate the important considerations of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence, the applicant’s subjective case, together with the statutory guideposts, the sentence imposed by his Honour could not be regarded as so unreasonable or plainly unjust as to warrant the Court’s intervention.
	


Consideration


	
	A submission that a sentence is excessive (or inadequate) derives from the last kind of error identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. To make good this ground, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].
	
	
	As has been frequently stated, the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]; Dinsdale v The Queen at [57]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [28]. The relevant question on appeal is whether the sentence is within a proper range: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371 (Hunt CJ at CL); Papworth v R [2011] NSWCCA 253 at [54] (Hoeben J (as his Honour then was); Whealy JA and Simpson J agreeing).
	
	
	The High Court reiterated in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]-[55] the limited value of statistics and previously decided cases in the sentencing process. Intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is not warranted simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Hili v The Queen at [59]. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King: Hili v The Queen at [59].
	
	
	Here the reliance placed on statistics by both the applicant and the Crown did not assist, other than to indicate, as the applicant contended, that there were very few comparable cases involving young offenders, with no prior offices and a plea of guilty, in the period January 2008 to December 2014.
	
	
	The focus in an appeal against sentence must be on the sentence actually imposed rather than on the notional starting point: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [40] (Buddin J; Simpson and Howie JJ agreeing). This is because the question for this Court is whether the sentence actually imposed was unreasonable: Adzioski v R at [72]; Graham v R at [40]; Yang v R at [63]; MacDonald v R [2007] NSWCCA 105 at [46]; Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [78].
	
	
	Another reason why the focus should be on the sentence actually imposed rather than upon the starting point or notional sentence, is as explained by R A Hulme J in Yang v R at [63] – the invitation to compare the “notional starting point” with sentences actually passed in other cases by way of statistics is to compare apples with oranges.
	
	
	This is not to say that it is never appropriate to have regard to the starting point, if the Court can be confident of what that was: Rutkowskyj v R [2008] NSWCCA 10 at [10] (Barr J; McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreeing). In TYN v R at [33]-[34] Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (Spigelman CJ and James J agreeing) expressed what might be thought to be an even stronger view in this regard. Where there is no dispute as to the reductions in sentence to which an offender is entitled, Simpson J considered that justice demands that the focus be on the starting point.
	
	
	In Graham v R at [40], Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) (Macfarlan JA and Grove J agreeing) said that he did not read the judgment of Simpson J in TYN v R at [33]-[34] as saying anything to the contrary to SZ v R at [40], MacDonald v R at [46] and Charlesworth v R at [78]. His Honour considered that Simpson J was saying no more than that it was legitimate when considering whether a sentence was manifestly excessive to have regard to the reasoning process which led up to it. In McGeown v R [2014] NSWCCA 314 at [13]-[14], Leeming JA expressed a similar view as to the effect of TYN v R, that is:
	


where … there is no dispute as to the reductions in sentence to which an offender is entitled, it is necessary to have regard to the starting point, lest the discounts be used to conceal and thereby sustain what might otherwise be a manifestly excessive sentence.


	
	The Crown did not submit in response to the applicant’s reliance upon TYN v R, that it was never appropriate to have regard to the notional starting point when considering whether the sentence actually imposed was manifestly excessive. Nor was there any dispute here that the applicant was entitled to the 25% discount on sentence. In essence, it is the asserted severity of the “starting point” that the applicant says explains how the resultant sentence is manifestly excessive: Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225 at [32] (R A Hulme J; Leeming JA and Price J agreeing).
	
	
	Taking into account the notional starting point here, the actual sentence imposed on the applicant, being a young offender with no prior offences, is undoubtedly a stern sentence. So much was fairly accepted by the Crown in oral argument (tcpt CCA at 9, line 17). Nonetheless, I do not regard a notional starting point of 9 years 4 months as necessarily and obviously excessive on the facts of this case. Nor do I regard the resultant sentence as manifestly excessive.
	
	
	First, the standard non-parole period of 7 years was a guidepost, as was the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. In light of the plea of guilty and his Honour’s finding that the offence was in the “mid-range somewhere”, a non-parole period of 4 years was not excessive.
	
	
	Secondly, as his Honour found, this offence was very serious. The offending was not impulsive, but involved a level of planning. The applicant was familiar with the business. He waited there for a little over 4 hours until the proprietor was preparing to leave for the day with the cash takings. He had brought with him a hammer and gloves. He was in contact with an accomplice by text messaging on his mobile phone. His attack on a vulnerable proprietor was brutal and unprovoked. It involved the infliction of physical injury. It was committed for financial gain.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant’s reliance upon the Henry guideline does not assist him. The primary relevance and role of the Henry guideline for related offences such as an offence under s 98, is that it states a range that is below the range that is appropriate for the s 98 offence: R v PB [2008] NSWCCA 109; 184 A Crim R 552 at [25]. His Honour referred to the Henry guideline and observed a number of differences in the present case. Relevantly, his Honour found that here there was more than minimal violence and the robbery involved a substantial amount of money.
	
	
	Fourthly, the applicant’s related contention based on the Henry guideline should be rejected. One cannot extrapolate from the 4-5 year total sentence in the Henry guideline for an offence under s 97 (20 years imprisonment), a proportionate increase of approximately 25% for the total sentence for an offence under s 98 (25 years imprisonment). This would be to ignore both the aggravating feature of the s 98 offence (wounding) and that it carries a standard non-parole period of 7 years. It would also be to ignore the very different circumstances of the offending in the present case to that envisaged in the Henry guideline for an offence under s 97, notwithstanding both involved some similar features – a young offender who has pleaded guilty, with no prior offences.
	
	
	His Honour was required to balance the aggravating and mitigating features of the applicant’s offending taking into account the statutory guideposts and his findings on the objective seriousness of the offending. It may be accepted that the applicant had a strong subjective case. Nonetheless the aggravating features already mentioned were significant. In my view, the sentence imposed by his Honour, although stern, was not unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	Ground 2 is not made out.
	
	
	Accordingly I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   The applicant be granted leave to appeal;

(2)   The appeal be dismissed.


	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Gleeson JA and the orders His Honour proposes.

		28 August 2015",2015-08-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702866,Clarke v R [2015] NSWCCA 232,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant, Joshua Jack Clarke, entered a plea of guilty to an offence of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means, in contravention of s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (“Trafficking Act”). The large commercial quantity is 200 plants: [1]  the sentencing judge found that “the number of growing cannabis plants was close to 2,000”. The applicant’s role in the cultivation was that of an employee, not a principal, but he clearly had a significant role in a sophisticated operation. The sentencing judge (Berman DCJ) sentenced him on the basis that “he was paid to do what he did and he did it for about a month.” [2] 
	
	
	The sentence imposed involved a non-parole period of four years and a head sentence of seven years. The sentence had been reduced by 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. Thus, absent the plea, he would have received a sentence with a non-parole period of five years and four months.
	
	
	The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”) dealing with the imposition of a standard non-parole period require that when sentencing for an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, the court is, if not setting the standard period as the non-parole period for the offence, to give reasons for setting a longer or shorter period. [3]  The standard non-parole period is said to represent the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. [4]  One reason not to set a standard non-parole period is that the judge considers that the offence in question does not fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However, the reasons for which there may be variation from the standard are said to be “only those referred to in s 21A.” [5]  Section 21A sets out numerous factors which are either aggravating or mitigating factors to be considered in the sentencing process. However, the court is “not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.” [6] 
	
	
	Whether the sentencing judge considered that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness is not entirely clear: there were a number of factors (other than the quantity involved and the sophistication of the operation) which might, in any event, have militated against the imposition of the standard period (or a non-parole period within a similar range). However, in noting that the sentence he was about to impose involved a non-parole period significantly below the standard period, the judge stated, “Were it not for the matters with which I began these remarks on sentence I would have chosen a much longer non-parole period.”
	
	
	In earlier remarks the judge referred to his own earlier reasoning in R v Ly [7]  and stated that “sentences imposed upon those convicted of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means do not appear to have reflected the seriousness with which the legislature says such offences should be treated.” The judge then noted that it was “an idiosyncratic view” and not consistent with the view taken by this Court with regard to sentences for such offences.
	
	
	These reasons demonstrated a real and understandable dilemma. There is no doubt that, with respect to some offences for which standard non-parole periods are specified, more weight is given to the standard than in other cases. That is partly because there appears to be a degree of arbitrariness in fixing the standard periods. However, for present purposes, the significance of the statement by the sentencing judge is that, because it expresses a reasonable and understandable concern, it is not possible to support a ground which alleges that he placed “too much emphasis on the standard non-parole period” (being ground 1 on the proposed appeal). At least that is so unless it could be said that he did not follow his own precept. However, as explained by Garling J, the sentence imposed was not outside the range indicated by earlier judgments of this Court. It follows that ground 1 cannot succeed.
	
	
	I agree with Garling J that ground 3 should also be rejected. It remains to consider ground 2 which alleged error on the part of the sentencing judge in his finding as to the number of plants being cultivated by the applicant. Two preliminary issues arise for consideration. The first is the status of two certificates prepared by an analyst; the second concerns the role of this court in reviewing fact-finding on sentence.
	


Certificates of analysis


	
	The prosecution tendered two certificates signed by an analyst, pursuant to s 43(2) of the Trafficking Act. The first certificate stated that the officer had “analysed 1,997 plants and [certified] that they were all cannabis plants”. A second certificate made a separate statement with respect to nine plants.
	
	
	There was no dispute that the plants were cannabis: the question was whether they were all “plants” for the purposes of the offence. A significant number were “seedlings of 10cm in height”: that they were cuttings of cannabis was not in doubt but there was a question as to whether each constituted a “growing plant” for the purpose of the definition of “cannabis plant” in s 3(1) of the Trafficking Act.
	
	
	There is no indication in the statute as to when vegetable material identifiable as cannabis becomes and ceases to be a “growing plant” for the purposes of the offence. The case was run on the basis that the correct approach was that identified by the Victorian Court of Appeal in The Queen v Francis-Wright [8]  where the Court was concerned with the adequacy of directions given to a jury as to what constituted a “plant” for an offence of cultivation under the relevant Victorian legislation. [9]  Callaway JA noted that although “plant” was an ordinary English word, it had a range of meanings. [10]  He considered that “a cutting becomes a plant … when it develops a root.” [11]  He rejected the proposition that it needed “a root system” or that it needed to be viable, matters which would require expert evidence.
	
	
	Williams AJA (with whom Batt JA agreed) stated: [12] 
	


“In my opinion, the meaning of the word ‘plant’ under the relevant provisions of the Act included a cutting which had struck or established roots. It could then be regarded as an entity separate from the plant from which it had been cut and differentiated from a ‘part’ of that plant.”


	
	The Court in Francis-Wright held that the word “plant” in its statutory context also included a dead plant: clearly the latter conclusion would not apply with respect to offences under the Trafficking Act involving a “prohibited plant”, or in the particular case, a “cannabis plant”, the definitions of each requiring that there be a “growing plant” of a relevant description. On the other hand, the use of the expression “growing plant” provides the real basis for the conclusion that a cutting without roots would not fall within the statutory language.
	
	
	What appears not to have been appreciated in the course of the sentencing proceedings was that the certificate of the analyst did not provide evidence as to the number of growing plants. For this purpose it is necessary to have regard to the terms of s 43 of the Trafficking Act, which relevantly provides:
	


43   Certificate evidence

(1)   Any analyst analysing any plant or substance submitted to the analyst or under whose supervision the analysis of any plant or substance submitted to the analyst is carried out may give a certificate of the result of the analysis.

(2)   In any legal proceedings under this Act, the production of a certificate, purporting to be signed by an analyst, shall be prima facie evidence of the identity of the plant or substance analysed, the quantity or mass of the plant or substance analysed and of the result of the analysis, without proof of the signature, employment or appointment of the person appearing to have signed the certificate.

(3)   Any appointed person analysing any plant submitted to the person may give a certificate of the result of the analysis.

(4)   In any legal proceedings under this Act, the production of a certificate, purporting to be signed by an appointed person, is prima facie evidence of:

(a)   the identity of the plant analysed, and

(b)   the quantity or mass of that plant,

without proof of the signature or appointment of the person appearing to have signed the certificate, but only if the plant identified is cannabis plant or cannabis leaf.

…

(6)   In this section:

…

plant includes any part of a plant, and the achene and seed of a plant.


	
	Whether the certificates of analysis were tendered under s 43(2) or 43(4) is not clear: the relevant officer gave oral evidence and said that he was an appointed person, for the purposes of subs (4). Importantly, s 43 does not provide for a determination of whether a particular plant is a “growing plant” and, indeed, the broad definition of “plant” in s 43(6) does not discriminate between seeds, parts of plants and whole plants. Accordingly, to the extent that a certificate may identify “the plant analysed” and “the quantity … of that plant” it is not a certificate as to the number of growing plants. It was, therefore, necessary to call someone who had inspected the plants, or at least photographed them, to give evidence of roots or root systems. In fact, the analyst was called and gave evidence of inspecting a sample of cuttings. There was a challenge based on the proposition that the sample of six seedlings from tubs containing 790 seedlings was an inadequate basis from which to infer that they all had roots. In fact the sentencing judge did not infer that they all had roots but that most of them did: the evidence that all 790 were of a similar size and in apparent good health supported such an inference.
	
	
	This was not a case in which the precise number of growing plants was important. Once the threshold of 200 was reached, the sentencing exercise did not require determination of whether there were 1,800 growing plants or 2,000, or merely a figure of that order. The inference drawn by the judge that “the number of growing cannabis plants was close to 2,000” was undoubtedly open to him; whether his further comment that “anything that was not a plant, because it did not have a root, would probably have shortly become a plant” involved error is a separate question. If it purported to be a finding on the probabilities, or if it purported to include such cases as growing plants at the time of the offence, there would have been error. However, it should not be so understood; rather it was a contextual fact of no immediate relevance to the finding as to the size of the actual population of growing plants.
	
	
	It is not in doubt that a finding of fact adverse to an offender on a sentencing hearing must be established beyond reasonable doubt if it is to be taken into account as an aggravating factor. [13]  What is more doubtful is the proposition that an appeal must fail if this Court is satisfied that a particular finding was “open” on the evidence.
	
	
	This question gives rise to an issue both as to the function of this Court on an appeal against sentence and what is meant by saying that a finding is “open”. With respect to the second issue, to say that a finding is not open may mean that the evidence could not, as a matter of law, support a finding to the requisite standard. On the other hand, it may mean something less than that, although it is hard to identify a precise meaning, other than that this Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the available evidence. It is this formulation which gives rise to a question as to the proper scope of the appeal.
	


Scope of appeal against sentence


	
	An appeal is available to a person convicted on indictment “with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction.” [14]  The statute does not prescribe the grounds or basis for such an appeal. Nor, in contrast to other more recently introduced provisions, does it state whether fresh, additional or substituted evidence may be relied upon by the offender. [15]  The Act does, however, confer powers in determining such an appeal:
	


6   Determination of appeals in ordinary cases

…

(3)   On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.


	
	In Kentwell v The Queen [16]  the joint reasons stated: [17] 
	


“Notwithstanding the breadth of its language, it was settled at an early stage that the appellate court's authority to intervene is dependent upon demonstration of error. [18]  The significance to the function of the appellate court of the distinction between specific error, of any of the kinds identified in House v The King, [19]  and the conclusion of manifest excess or inadequacy is explained by Hayne J in AB v The Queen. [20]  In the case of specific error, the appellate court's power to intervene is enlivened and it becomes its duty to re-sentence, unless in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion it concludes that no different sentence should be passed. By contrast, absent specific error, the appellate court may only intervene if it concludes that the sentence falls outside the permissible range of sentences for the offender and the offence.”


	
	The Court accepted a statement of Spigelman CJ in Baxter v The Queen [21]  clarifying a passage in an earlier judgment, R v Simpson: [22] 
	


“The import of par [79] of Simpson was to ensure that submissions in the Court of Criminal Appeal did not proceed as if the identification of error created an entitlement on the part of an Applicant to a new sentence, for example, by merely adjusting the sentence actually passed to allow for the error identified. That would be to proceed on the assumption that the sentencing judge was presumptively correct, when the Court has determined that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.”


	
	Having accepted the principle, the joint reasons in Kentwell continued: [23] 
	


“When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, [24]  the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing [25]  and the factors that the [Sentencing Procedure Act] [26] , and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ‘warranted in law’. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ‘warranted in law’ unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the [Sentencing Procedure Act] requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.”


	
	Returning to the circumstances in Kentwell itself, the Court then explained: [27] 
	


“In assessing the prospects that the appellant's appeal would succeed, it was wrong to determine that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that substantial injustice was occasioned by the sentence. This is best understood as a conclusion that the aggregate sentence did not impress the Court, upon summary review, as excessive. The appellant is entitled to be sentenced according to law. The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody and current mental state, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.”


	
	For completeness, it is appropriate to identify the passage in AB v The Queen [28]  referred to with approval in Kentwell, in which Hayne J had explained the difference in approach required where a specific error has been identified, as opposed to a manifestly excessive sentence. Hayne J stated: [29] 
	


“The difference between cases of specific error and manifest excess is not merely a matter of convenient classification. It reflects a fundamental difference in what the appellate court does. In the former case, once an appellate court identifies an error, the sentence imposed below must be set aside and the appellate court is then required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. The offender must be re-sentenced unless, of course, in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion the appellate court concludes that no different sentence should be passed. By contrast, in the case of manifest excess, the error in reasoning of the sentencing judge is not discernible; all that can be seen is that the sentence imposed is too heavy and thus lies outside the permissible range of dispositions. Only then may the appellate court intervene and, in the exercise of its discretion, consider what sentence is to be imposed.”


	
	This Court continues to identify the scope of the appeal against sentence available to an offender by reference to a statement of Hunt J in R v O’Donoghue [30]  in the following terms:
	


“It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing. An appeal which is not by way of rehearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below …. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. … It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this Court can intervene in relation to a trial judge’s findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice … Kryiakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61.”


	
	The language adopted in O’Donoghue should be approached with caution for a number of reasons. First, it was concerned, as the last sentence in the quotation indicates, with an appeal against conviction, to be addressed under s 6(1), not s 6(3). That said, it involved a challenge to a finding by the trial judge on a voir dire, relevant to the admissibility of evidence. Secondly, although there was reference to the judgment in a civil case as authority for the first proposition, [31]  the apparent dismissal of discussion of the scope of civil appeals may not be of assistance. Thus, in Lacey v Attorney-General (Qld) [32]  the joint reasons [33]  expressly adopted a statement of relevant classes of appeal derived from Turnbull v Medical Board (NSW). [34]  (Lacey itself involved a consideration of the scope of a right of appeal conferred on the Attorney-General with respect to a sentence in a criminal case.)
	
	
	Thirdly, O’Donoghue appears to equate an appeal by way of rehearing with what is usually described as an appeal in the strict sense. [35]  By contrast, an appeal by way of rehearing depends upon the demonstration of “some legal, factual or discretionary error” on the part of the primary judge. [36]  Furthermore, appeals by way of rehearing cover a range of circumstances including a power to receive evidence, identified in a range of terminology.
	
	
	Fourthly, O’Donoghue was decided in 1988; some eight years later in R v Ion [37]  Hunt CJ at CL stated that the only basis upon which an appeal would be allowed from a trial by judge alone would be “if error had been demonstrated in the sense that there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or that the evidence is all one way, or that the judge misdirected himself or herself, leading to a miscarriage of justice”. [38] 
	
	
	Although that statement was challenged as erroneous in Fleming v The Queen, [39]  neither it nor the principle established in O’Donoghue (also referred to in Fleming [40] ) was expressly overruled. However, comment was made in Fleming with respect to a third decision of Hunt CJ at CL, R v Kurtic, [41]  where it was said that “an appeal against conviction from a trial by judge alone pursuant to s 33 of the Criminal Appeal Act [presumably meaning the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)] is not an appeal by way of rehearing”. [42]  Dealing with that proposition, the Court in Fleming stated: [43] 
	


“The phrase ‘by way of rehearing’ has been used to identify various characteristics of the appellate process and does not necessarily have a fixed or settled meaning. It is best used only when required by a statutory text. The phrase is not found in the legislation with which this appeal is concerned and does not immediately assist as a criterion of differentiation in identifying the incidents of the appellate process for which the legislation does provide.”


	
	That warning alone might have sufficed to discourage this Court from repetition of the similar language used in O’Donoghue.
	
	
	Fifthly, the last sentence in the passage from O’Donoghue set out above relied for support on a passage in Kyriakou in this Court. Kyriakou had been the subject of a special leave application to the High Court. In refusing special leave, Mason CJ (speaking for a Full Court [44] ) said:
	


“Although the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal does not accurately express the role of an appellate court when a challenge is made to such a finding of fact by a trial judge, the Court is not persuaded that the Court of Criminal Appeal failed to examine for itself the critical issue of fact.” [45] 


	
	Reading together the second and third sentences in the extract from O’Donoghue set out above, it appears that factual error can only be found where there is, in effect, an error of law or something very close to it. That would not accord with the explanation in Kyriakou that the appeal court should examine for itself the issue of fact. Nor does it accord with the approach identified in House v The King, [46]  referring to appellable error as including the sentencing judge having “mistaken the facts”.
	
	
	Finally, the limited approach to the identification of factual error asserted in O’Donoghue is not supported by the recent statement from Kentwell set out above: there, the joint reasons accepted that the exercise of the discretionary power would miscarry where the judge “mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration”. (There is no indication that the reference to a material consideration was intended to refer to a mandatory consideration, in the sense that failure to take it into account would demonstrate error of law.)
	
	
	In some circumstances, factual findings will themselves involve an evaluative judgment, of a kind similar to the exercise of a discretionary power. [47]  No doubt the appellate court should exercise restraint in interfering with such findings. However, if the court is satisfied that the sentencing judge made a mistake with respect to a particular factual finding, which was material to the exercise of the discretionary power, the court should identify error and then enter upon its own consideration of the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The present case provides an example of how those principles might operate. If this Court were persuaded that the sentencing judge had significantly overestimated the number of plants under cultivation, for whatever reason, being an issue material to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, that would be a relevant error.
	
	
	To take a more limited approach would, no doubt, discourage applications for leave to appeal against sentence on factual grounds which may have limited prospects of success. However, if there be an error which may have affected the sentence imposed, the public interest in fairness to the individual offender does not warrant a construction of s 6(3) which would have the application dismissed at the preliminary stage. Fact finding is often critical to the ultimate imposition of a sentence. [48]  If the legislature had intended to limit applications for leave to appeal against sentence to circumstances where error of law can be identified, one would expect it to have said so. The authority of the High Court does not warrant the imposition of such a restriction; indeed it is unequivocally to the contrary. It may be that O’Donoghue was not intended to impose such a restriction: nevertheless, there are aspects of the language used which might be (and are) so understood. In my view, that is an erroneous approach.
	


Conclusion


	
	In applying the principles set out above, I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge did mistake the facts, or draw an inference other than that which was properly drawn on the material before him. He was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the number of plants involved in the offence was in the order of 2,000. No element of numerical precision was intended, nor was it required.
	
	
	For these reasons all three grounds of appeal have failed. I accept that the issues raised warrant a grant of leave, but the appeal must be dismissed.
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW, by his Honour Judge Berman on 7 March 2014.
	
	
	The applicant, Joshua Jack Clarke, pleaded guilty before Berman DCJ to an indictment on which there was one offence, contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, namely, that on 8 November 2012, he:
	


“… did cultivate a quantity of prohibited plants by enhanced indoor means, being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity.”


	
	This offence related to an occasion on 8 November 2012, when the applicant was apparently residing on a property near Oallen, on which there was a sophisticated hydroponic cannabis cultivation taking place inside a number of sheds on the property. Police located a large number of cannabis plants in various stages of growth on the property. As will become apparent, the precise number of these plants which, for the purposes of the offence, were found to be plants, was an issue in dispute, although it was not in dispute that the number was not less than the large commercial quantity, that is, 200.
	
	
	At the same time that he was sentenced, the applicant asked the Court to take into account an offence contrary to s 36Z(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, of organising the conduct of drug premises. The schedule offence related to the premises at which the cultivation referred to in the principal offence was taking place.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of cultivation of a large commercial quantity of prohibited plants was 20 years imprisonment. A standard non‑parole period of 10 years imprisonment was applicable.
	
	
	Berman DCJ imposed an overall sentence of 7 years imprisonment, with a non‑parole period of 4 years, commencing on 8 November 2012, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested.
	


Facts


	
	The following summary of facts is taken from the Statement of Facts tendered to the sentencing Judge, and from his Honour’s summary.
	
	
	It will be necessary to consider separately the issue of how many of the plants which were discovered, constituted plants within the meaning of the legislation.
	
	
	The property at Oallen consisted of about 100 acres which were owned as a freehold. An adjoining 100 acres of Crown land were leased by the owner of the Oallen property.
	
	
	The property contained a Colorbond shed which had provision for living accommodation, including two bedrooms, a dining and living area, a kitchen and a bathroom. There were other sheds on the property.
	
	
	When police visited the property on 8 November 2012, they entered the main shed, and found the accused and two other males in a bedroom within the shed. In that bedroom was an electronic installation designed for security purposes to capture what was happening outside the shed on various CCTV cameras.
	
	
	Adjoining the bedroom in which the applicant was found, was a large, sophisticated, hydroponic cannabis cultivation inside the shed. Within that room police located 1,997 “plants” in various stages of growth ranging from seedlings 10cm tall to plants 100cm tall.
	
	
	The “plants” were removed and later examined by an officer of the NSW Department of Primary Industries.
	
	
	The police then moved to search a hayshed, also located on the property. It contained several hundred rectangular bales of hay. In the middle of the hayshed, between two haystacks, the police located a tunnel that ran into an underground bunker. In that bunker, police located another nine cannabis plants growing in pots under growing lights. There was also a bank of transformers, and two large generators mounted on the floor. Those plants were approximately 1.2m tall.
	
	
	There was no doubt that all of the plants which were recovered on the property were cannabis sativa.
	
	
	Located in the principal room and operating at the time of police entry, were multiple growing lights, growing beds, fertilisers, electric transformers, fans, humidifiers and ducting. The principal room was about 10m x 10m. The roof and walls of the building were covered in a form of fibreglass sealant. There was an irrigation system present amongst the plants to facilitate watering of them.
	
	
	In another small room off the main shed police located between 100 and 200 bags of soil conditioner, several 20 litre drums of a concentrated liquid plant nutrient, as well as spare light globes, ducting, electrical wiring and components.
	
	
	The police concluded, and this was not disputed, that the cost involved in establishing the sophisticated growing system which was discovered, and the ongoing growing costs, was strongly indicative of the cultivation being a major commercial operation. It was the police contention that at the end of the growth cycle, each of the plants would yield about $2,000 and, accordingly, the whole of the planation had a street value of approximately $4M.
	
	
	When questioned, the applicant acknowledged that all of the plants were his and that he was leasing the premises. He claimed entire ownership of all of the equipment and plants.
	
	
	It was accepted in the proceedings before the sentencing Judge that, although the applicant claimed sole responsibility for the cultivation, he was in fact acting as an employee, receiving instructions as to what to do and carrying them out. It was accepted that he was not involved in the setting up of the operation or the financing of it.
	


Sentence Proceedings in the District Court


	
	In the District Court, it became apparent that there was a dispute as to whether all of the 1,997 “plants” discovered in the main shed were cannabis plants within the meaning of that term, as it is used in s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Accordingly, evidence was taken on that question. A number of exhibits were also tendered.
	
	
	His Honour determined the disputed question of fact in an extempore judgment delivered after the evidence and submissions on the issue were completed, and before proceeding to consider the balance of the material on sentence.
	
	
	In his judgment his Honour held that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all of the examined items were plants within the legislation. However, he held that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt “… that a large proportion of the unexamined items were cannabis plants”. His Honour’s finding and reasons will be examined in more detail when considering the grounds of appeal, and the submissions with respect to them.
	
	
	In addition to material dealing with the principal factual dispute, the Crown tendered a psychiatric report. The applicant’s counsel tendered a report from Mr Phil Gorlell, a psychologist, a number of personal references and a handwritten letter from the applicant to the Court. The applicant did not give evidence. Counsel for the applicant made submissions to the Court, as did counsel for the Crown.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	His Honour described the operation and the applicant’s role in that operation. He held that the applicant was an employee in a very large scale commercial cannabis growing organisation. His Honour described the size and sophistication of the operation and concluded that it was one which had as its object the cultivation and distribution of a large amount of cannabis.
	
	
	His Honour drew attention to the fact that the commercial quantity of cannabis plants for the offence with which the applicant was charged was 200. He said that he was satisfied that the number of growing cannabis plants was “… close to 2000”. He added that anything that was not a plant because it did not have a root system would probably have shortly developed one.
	
	
	His Honour made it clear that he was not suggesting that the number of plants was of itself determinative of sentence, but rather that the scale of the operation was important in assessing the applicant’s objective criminality.
	
	
	He identified the agreed position with respect to the applicant’s role as being that the applicant was acting as an employee, receiving instructions as to what to do and carrying them out. His Honour noted that the Crown did not suggest that the applicant was involved in setting up the operation or financing it. His Honour concluded that he should sentence the applicant on the basis that he was paid to do what he was doing, and he had been undertaking his role as an employee for about a month.
	
	
	These conclusions are not the subject of any challenge.
	
	
	His Honour discussed the subjective circumstances of the applicant. He noted that the applicant’s parents had had a disharmonious relationship which had ended when his father died when the applicant was about 8 years old. The applicant’s mother was not able to cope with the death of her spouse. The applicant seems to have been brought up in somewhat squalid circumstances. The applicant’s mother died when he was about 14 years old, and he was informally adopted by a family friend with whom he lived for about five years.
	
	
	The applicant fell into an association with an outlaw motorcycle group and became involved in their illegal activities. The sentencing Judge noted that although he had been sent to jail for a serious offence of discharging a firearm at a dwelling house with disregard for public safety, having been released on parole, the applicant had done quite well.
	
	
	At the age of 13, the applicant was sexually assaulted by an employer. All of the applicant’s life experiences resulted in the development of depression which has required medication whilst in custody.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant had a great deal of support available to him, and that he had some prospects of rehabilitation particularly with the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service after his release from custody, together with the assistance of those who had provided references.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and indicated that he was prepared to discount any sentence which he would otherwise have imposed by 25%. His Honour did not regard the litigation of the disputed fact as impacting upon that discount.
	
	
	His Honour made a finding of special circumstances and, as I have indicated earlier, having taken into account the offence on the Form 1, he imposed a non‑parole period of 4 years with a total sentence of 7 years.
	
	
	His Honour fixed the expiration of the applicant’s non-parole as 7 November 2016.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	On 19 December 2014, the applicant filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal. He nominated three grounds. They were as follows:
	


“Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in placing too much emphasis on the standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence so as to give it determinative significance.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his finding as to the number of plants cultivated by the applicant.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in failing to impose a sentence that properly took into account the applicant’s subjective circumstances warranting lesser weight being given to general deterrence.”

Ground 2


	
	It is convenient to commence the consideration of the grounds of appeal with Ground 2, which challenges the factual finding of the trial Judge with respect to the number of plants which were being cultivated, and in respect of which the applicant was charged.
	
	
	As earlier indicated, his Honour delivered a separate judgment with respect to the number of plants. His Honour had before him the evidence which is described below, and the video taken during the execution of the search warrant. As well, he had photographs of the operation.
	
	
	His Honour first addressed the question of what was a plant. He identified what was to be seen on the video, and in the still photographs as items which were cuttings which had been placed in a growing medium. His Honour noted that it was necessary for him to be satisfied that a cutting had to have developed roots before it could be described as a plant.
	
	
	Evidence was taken from Mr W B Haigh, the senior regulatory inspector for the region of the NSW Department of Primary Industries. He was an appointed person under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, whose role was to examine any plants seized, relevantly in the circumstances here, to determine if they were cannabis plants for the purposes of the relevant offence. As well, Mr M D Woods, a detective sergeant of police, who was one of the principal investigators who visited the scene where the applicant was arrested, also gave evidence.
	
	
	His Honour turned to consider the evidence of Mr Haigh, and identified with respect to the evidence which he gave, the relevant question as being whether he could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the items which were not examined by Mr Haigh to see whether they had roots, were in fact plants.
	
	
	The applicant did not call, or tender any evidence on this question.
	
	
	On 8 November 2012, Mr Haigh completed a certificate under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act with respect to the 1,997 plants found in the main shed. That certificate relevantly contained the following statements:
	


“1,997 Cannabis plants ranging in size 10cm to 100cm and were arranged in lots of 6 through to 100, all plants were in a healthy condition at time of inspection.”


	
	Mr Haigh went on to complete the certificate, saying the following:
	


“I have analysed 1,997 plants and hereby certify that they were all cannabis plants (botanically known as Cannabis Sativa). I then returned all the plants to D/S M Woods.”


	
	Mr Haigh also certified the nine plants which were discovered separately in the bunker under the hayshed. There is no dispute with respect to his certifications.
	
	
	In his evidence, Mr Haigh explained that the process which he followed to reach the conclusion expressed in his certificate was to take from each of the two long growing trays a sample of 6 plants out of a total of 790 plants in each tray to assess whether or not they were in fact plants within the meaning of the relevant legislation. Mr Haigh indicated that he had chosen the six plants from each tub essentially at random.
	
	
	It does not appear to have been in contest that Mr Haigh had correctly identified the 12 plants which he had removed as each having roots, a stem and leaves and therefore each of them qualifying as plants. His Honour noted that the fact that each of the plants which had been removed had roots and were plants, made it likely, at the very least, that the remainder of the items also had roots.
	
	
	I take this to be a statement that his Honour was prepared to draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt, that since 100% of the samples which had been examined were able to be identified as plants, then it is likely that the balance of the plants would have the same characteristics.
	
	
	His Honour went on to identify the fact that from his observation of the video and photographs, all of the plants in the trays were of approximately the same size. He found that he was satisfied that the cuttings were probably placed in the growing medium at about the same time, and based upon the inference to which I have drawn attention and those physical observations, his Honour found that he was satisfied that a large proportion of the unexamined items were cannabis plants.
	
	
	It is convenient to note that in cross-examination, Mr Haigh accepted that although he was a person who had been appointed for the purpose of examining plants seized by NSW Police to determine whether they were cannabis plants within the meaning of the relevant legislation, he was not qualified as an expert to describe the way in which a plant grew from a cutting. He was able to inform the Court from his experience as a gardener that, when a plant is grown from a cutting, as each of the items in question were, each cutting is put into the rooting compound or medium and initially the foliage, the leaves, will tend to droop and after a period of time, often a number of days, it starts to develop roots and then the appearance of the cutting changes, the drooping ceases and the plant appears to be growing healthily.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Haigh said that he was not qualified to give a time period between the time when a cutting might be taken and placed into a medium, and when the roots would commence to develop. He also indicated that he did not know whether leaves on cloned plants required watering in the absence of a root system.
	
	
	It is important to note that his Honour was not confronted with any evidence that suggested that Mr Haigh was in error in identifying the plants which he in fact examined, as being properly developed plants having all three components sufficient to fall within the requisite definition. Such a proposition was not suggested to Mr Haigh. Nor was his Honour confronted with any evidence that any other of the plants within the trays from which the samples were taken by Mr Haigh, had been examined by anyone else, whether expert or otherwise, and that observations had been made which indicated that root systems had not developed. In other words, there was not a direct conflict of evidence before his Honour on this factual question which his Honour needed to assess.
	
	
	Rather, the principal submission before his Honour was whether the six plants which had been taken as a sample from each of the two trays were, having regard to the numbers of plants in each tray, an adequate sample to enable a conclusion to be drawn as to the number of the items growing in the tubs as being plants.
	
	
	As I have earlier said, his Honour concluded that “… a large proportion of unexamined items were cannabis plants”.
	
	
	It is submitted on appeal that his Honour was in error and that there was no evidence that items of approximately the same size would have the same or similar root system developed in them. Further, it was submitted that there was no evidence to support the finding that the cuttings were probably placed in the growing medium at about the same time. Finally, it was submitted that it was erroneous for the sentencing Judge to place weight on the finding that items that were not plants would have become plants in due course.
	
	
	In conclusion, it was submitted that the applicant should have been sentenced on the basis that he cultivated 1,217 plants rather than something “close to 2,000 plants”.
	
	
	In considering the competing submissions with respect to this finding of fact, it is first appropriate to identify the basis upon which this Court acts when confronted with such arguments.
	
	
	In R v O’Donoghue [49] , Hunt J, with whom Carruthers and Wood JJ agreed, said:
	


“It is important to emphasise that unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing. An appeal which is not by way of rehearing, is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the Court below … Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this Court has no power to substitute its own findings from those of the trial Judge.”


	
	That decision has been applied on many occasions. One recent example is a decision of this Court in AB v R [50]  [2014] NSWCCA 339 where Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom Meagher JA and Wilson J agreed, said:
	


“54.   Since O'Donoghue, the same principle has been re-stated on many occasions: for example, R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505; R v Aoun [2011] NSWCCA 284; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222; 220 A Crim R 19; Peters v R [2013] NSWCCA 324. In the interests of brevity, I have forborne to mention the other decisions identified by Johnson J in Aoun (at [35]) and Latham J in Peters (at [42]).

55   The final nail in the coffin of any argument to the contrary is to be found in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 (a decision referred to in the applicant's argument in a different context) at [35]:

‘The history of the provision [s 6(3)] is touched on in Lacey v A-G (Qld) [[2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573]. Notwithstanding the breadth of its language, it was settled at an early stage that the appellate court's authority to intervene is dependent upon demonstration of error."" (italics added)

…

60.   The authorities that state the principles on which, it was submitted, this Court should review findings of fact by a sentencing judge are Warren v Coombes and Fox v Percy. As mentioned above, both are civil cases. Both are cases in which the operative legislation (relevant for present purposes) was s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), pursuant to which appeals are by way of rehearing. An issue, in particular in Fox v Percy, was the ‘dichotomy’ between the appellate obligation to correct error, and appellate restraint in the interference with decisions properly committed to first instance judges. There is nothing, in either Warren v Coombes, or in Fox v Percy that could reasonably be extrapolated to decisions under s 5 or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

…

62.   I reject the proposition that this Court ought to review Adams J's finding of fact (made by inference from agreed facts) that the applicant wished to torture AG by the infliction of a maximum degree of pain. No error has been shown in that finding. I have already held that the finding was, on the evidence, open.”

See also: Colville v R [51] .


	
	Accordingly, the question is whether the applicant has persuaded this Court that the sentencing Judge fell into error on the basis that the finding of fact was not open to the sentencing Judge. I am not so satisfied.
	
	
	The photographs and video to which the sentencing Judge had regard, gave him a visual picture of the nature of the plants in question, their height or size, the extent to which they appeared to be living and thriving, and the way in which they had been planted, namely together in a tray kept for the purpose of cultivation, and the manner of their planting, namely in reasonably ordered rows.
	
	
	As well, the fact that 100% of a randomly selected sample had, upon examination, been found to constitute complete plants, was a basis for an inference that the group from which the sample was taken would, if all examined, have been probably all the same. His Honour’s inference, that a large proportion of the unexamined items ought be found to be plants was, in my opinion, open to him.
	
	
	In understanding the factual findings of the sentencing Judge in this respect, it is also important to keep in mind that his Honour was not confronted with any contradictory evidence which suggested that in the balance of the sample there was any one or more of the plants in the two trays which had been identified as not being a complete plant within the definition of the legislation.
	
	
	I accept that it was not relevant to the consideration of the finding to be made by the sentencing Judge whether plants would in due course, if they were not already, become plants by dint of ordinary growth. But this conclusion was not an integral part of the sentencing Judge’s conclusion of fact upon which the applicant was sentenced.
	
	
	I am unpersuaded that this ground ought be upheld. I am unpersuaded that the finding made by the sentencing Judge was not open to him and I am unpersuaded that there has been error of the requisite kind. I would not uphold this ground.
	


Grounds 1 and 3


	
	It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. Ground 1 raises a question as to whether the sentencing Judge erred in placing too much emphasis on the standard non-parole period, and gave it determinative significance; Ground 3 raises the question of whether the Judge failed to properly consider and take into account the appellant’s subjective circumstances. Put differently, it was the applicant’s submission that his sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	As senior counsel for the applicant put it orally:
	


“… This sentence was at the very upper end of the sentencing range and disproportionate, unless there was far too much weight given to the number of plants.”


	
	The submissions of the applicant commenced with the proposition that the sentence nominally imposed upon the applicant, before a discount for his plea of guilty, was 9 years and 4 months (wrongly put in the written submissions as 9 years and 10 months) which, when combined with the initial remarks of the sentencing Judge where he refers to his view, expressed in a decision in 2010 that “… sentences imposed upon those convicted of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means do not appear to have reflected the seriousness with which the legislature says such offences should be treated”, and when taken with his adjectival description of the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years as “two significant matters”, had the result that the sentence which was imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant rightly notes the remarks of the sentencing Judge with respect to his view that sentences for the offence such as that imposed on the applicant, do not generally reflect the seriousness which the legislature accords to the offence, but it is important to observe that his Honour, having made such a remark, and noted that it was his personal view, went on to say that it was not a matter for him to take an idiosyncratic view inconsistent with that of this Court when this Court has dealt with sentences for offences of the kind with which his Honour was dealing. Whilst his Honour expressed his personal view as to the appropriate length of sentence, it is plain that he went on to disregard that view, and sentence by reference to conventional norms.
	
	
	Nor is it a valid criticism to say that his Honour used the adjective “significant” when referring to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period. They are legislative guideposts to which a sentencing court is obliged to have regard: Muldrock v R [52] . In the course of the sentencing process, the task of a judge is to identify all of the relevant factors and discuss their significance, ultimately making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence: Markarian v The Queen [53] . Here, the fact that the sentencing Judge described these legislative guideposts as significant does nothing more than to indicate that he was awarding them some weight, and was not ignoring the two guideposts in the sentencing exercise upon which he was engaged. I am not persuaded that any error is shown here.
	
	
	By reference to Ground 3, the applicant’s submissions accept that the operation in which the applicant was involved was a significant commercial operation, but submit that his role was one of being an employee for a limited period of a month, and that he had significant subjective circumstances which meant that he ought to have received a significantly lower sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions concluded in the following way:
	


“… It is submitted that a lesser sentence that is warranted at law, is one which reflects the actual number of ‘plants’ that the applicant cultivated having proper regard to the standard non-parole period and giving appropriate weight to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. It is submitted that some amelioration by the reduction of the effective head sentence and the maintenance of the ratio as between the non-parole period and the head sentence is warranted.”


	
	The Court has been referred to a significant number of cases which have dealt with similar offences. I will shortly mention two of these.
	
	
	No one case will be identical with the issues presented here. The factors to which this Court has in the past had regard include the size, sophistication and complexity of the indoor-enhanced cultivation; the number of plants or quantity of cannabis produced by the operation and seized by the police; the role of the particular offender, namely whether the offender was a principal or an employee, or in some cases merely a watchman; and the various subjective circumstances applicable. Usually, but not universally, the sentences imposed have followed early pleas of guilty, and involved discounts of about 25%.
	
	
	In 2013, this Court in Crawford v R [54] , imposed a sentence of imprisonment of a non-parole period of 5 years and 7 months, and a total term of 7 years and 6 months in circumstances where there was a total of 319 plants and 3.476kg of cannabis leaf seized from a sophisticated hydroponic cultivation system.
	
	
	The offender, in that case, who had engaged in the conduct because of financial difficulties, was considerably more mature than the applicant in the present case, and was regarded as the principal.
	
	
	In CO v R [55] , this Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment including a non-parole period of 4 years where the applicant nurtured 266 plants for a period of 3 months and was fully involved in all aspects of the cultivation process, and as well, intended harvesting the plants for himself with the intention of selling the harvested leaf. The applicant was 44 at the time of his arrest and had no prior criminal history. He had had a difficult childhood including being a refugee from Vietnam.
	
	
	As well, this Court was provided with a printout of statistics of a variety of offences against the section under which the applicant was charged.
	
	
	The Court’s approach to other cases and to statistics is well-known and does not need to be restated. I have carefully read and considered all of the cases to which reference has been made. The factors applicable in each case vary amongst themselves. In some cases, when compared with this case, the offenders were older. Some had no previous criminal history, others did. In some cases the quantity of drugs was less, in other cases somewhat greater.
	
	
	No precise comparison is possible. However, having carefully read and considered those cases, what can be discerned is that the sentence imposed here did not fall outside either the top or bottom end of the ranges so as to enable it on that account to be described as manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Nor am I persuaded that this is so. The sentencing Judge paid careful attention to the nature of the offence, the significant margin by which the number of plants exceeded the level required for a commercial quantity, the early plea of guilty, the subjective factors of the applicant and the sophistication of the operation, including his limited role in it.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the applicant has demonstrated that his sentence is manifestly excessive. I would not propose to uphold Grounds 2 or 3.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, I am not persuaded that any of the grounds ought be upheld. Nevertheless, the sentence imposed is one of significance to the applicant. I would be prepared to grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	HAMILL J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgments of both Basten JA and Garling J. I agree with their Honours that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
	
	
	While I consider the sentence to be a severe one in view of the subservient role played by the applicant and the relatively brief period of his involvement, the agreed facts demonstrated that the cultivation was one of considerable sophistication with the potential to yield a substantial amount of drugs. On any view of the factual dispute played out in the District Court, and again on appeal, the quantity of plants grown by “enhanced indoor means” far exceeded the large commercial quantity.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Basten JA, I agree that ground 1 (the assertion that the Judge gave “too much emphasis” to the standard non-parole period) cannot be sustained. Neither the remarks of Berman SC DCJ, nor the sentencing outcome, support such a conclusion.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Garling J, I agree that ground 3 (that too much weight was given to general deterrence and insufficient regard had to the applicant’s subjective circumstances) must also be rejected. A determination of the weight to be given to the various, often counterveiling, factual circumstances and purposes of punishment, is a matter in relation to which intermediate appellate courts are hesitant in interfering with the exercise of discretionary judgments of sentencing judges.
	
	
	As Basten JA points out, ground 2 (asserting a factual error in relation to the calculation of the number of plants cultivated) raises a number of considerations. I agree with the analysis of the evidence undertaken by both Basten JA and Garling J and with their Honours’ factual conclusions. I agree with what Basten JA has written about the evidentiary and legal significance of the certificates and the operation of s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	In rejecting ground 2, Garling J has employed the language that it was “open” to the primary Judge to make the factual findings that he did. That language accords with an abundance of authority in this Court emphasising the limitations on the Court’s jurisdiction to intervene with the exercise of discretionary judgments in criminal cases (particularly sentencing judgments) including cases where the question has been directly considered. [56] 
	
	
	Basten JA has questioned whether this approach accords with the statutory language in s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and the words of House v The King [57]  concerning the category of error in discretionary judgment where a judge allegedly “mistook the facts”. Basten JA takes the view that the language employed in O’Donoghue is unnecessarily restrictive and should be approached with caution. His Honour has expressed similar sentiments in earlier cases. [58] 
	
	
	In AB v R, [59]  Simpson J (as her Honour then was) undertook a detailed analysis of the question and concluded at [61] that “no proper basis has been advanced for the proposed major departure from established authority and practice”. However, her Honour stressed that her “conclusions have been drawn in the absence of full argument”. Simpson J stated her conclusion on the impugned factual finding in that case by holding that “the finding was, on the evidence, open”.
	
	
	In Peters v R [60]  there was a “challenge to the authority of O’Donoghue”. Latham J (with whom RA Hulme and Barr AJ agreed) decided at [45] that “there is no need to re-visit the application of O’Donoghue in the circumstances of this case”. The basis of this decision was that the relevant findings on the issue were not findings of fact. [61]  Thus, when Latham J identified the type of errors referred to in House v the King [62]  at [44], she omitted reference to the category of case where the Judge “mistakes the facts”.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case the result is the same, however one approaches the challenge made to the factual findings. For that reason, it is strictly unnecessary to decide the point or to attempt to resolve the tension in the authorities. However, I find the reasoning of Basten JA on this issue to be highly persuasive and I am inclined to the view that the statements of principle in O’Donoghue are unable to withstand scrutiny. At least, the catalogue of errors founding jurisdiction provided by Hunt J in O’Donoghue is not exhaustive, a matter upon which Simpson J agreed in AB. [63]   But the matter is more fundamental than that and I agree with Basten JA [64]  that the jurisdiction of the Court includes determining whether “the court is satisfied that the sentencing judge made a mistake with respect to a particular factual finding, which was material to the exercise of the discretionary power”. This accords with the language in House v The King (“mistakes the facts”) [65]  and the implicit reasoning in the determination of the special leave application in Kyriakou v The Queen (“examine for itself the critical issue of fact”) [66] . Neither the language of ss 5-6 of the Criminal Appeal Act nor the High Court’s decision in Kentwell v The Queen [67]  supports a more restrictive approach.
	
	
	While that is a majority view in the Court as presently constituted, it appears to be contrary to a substantial line of authority in this Court and the approach of most of the Judges who regularly sit in this Court.
	
	
	In Filippou v The Queen, there was a challenge to the decision in O’Donoghue in the context of an appeal from a trial by Judge alone. [68]  The High Court [69]  considered the nature of appellate review under s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act in the context of the findings of fact made in a trial by Judge alone. [70]  The Court held [71]  that the approach was the same whether the trial was by Judge alone or by jury and that the appropriate test was that stated in M v The Queen. [72]  Accordingly, a trial judge’s finding of guilty “is not to be disturbed unless there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or the evidence was all the one way, or the judge has so misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law as to result in a miscarriage of justice”. [73] 
	
	
	The decision in Filippou v The Queen did not concern the proper approach to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In the absence of a clear decision in the High Court, it may be that the tension or conflict in the authorities is a matter best resolved in an appropriate case by a specially constituted bench of five judges.
	
	
	However, as I have said, on either approach, no error is identified in the remarks of Berman DCJ and on my review of the material his Honour did not “mistake the facts”.
	
	
	The case raises important questions and the sentence was a severe one. For those reasons, leave to appeal should be granted. However, each of the individual grounds must be rejected and the appeal dismissed.

		28 August 2015",2015-08-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702868,R v Basanovic and ors (No. 5) [2015] NSWSC 1197,"Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of the case for the Crown and the cases for Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic Senior Counsel for Brian Brown applied for an acquittal by direction on the basis that there was no case to answer against his client. At the same time Mr Korn of counsel for Michael Basanovic made a similar application in respect of his client. It should be noted, however, that Michael Basanovic had himself given evidence and had called other evidence in his case and closed his case at the time his application was made.
	
	
	On 25 August 2015 I indicated that I would accede to the application made on behalf of Brian Brown but would refuse the application by Michael Basanovic. On that day I directed that the jury should find Mr Brown not guilty on both Counts charged, that is, murder and cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. I said I would provide reasons later. These are those reasons.
	
	
	The principles on which a trial judge should direct a verdict of acquittal are well settled. The question is whether at the time a no case to answer submission is made the accused could lawfully be convicted on the evidence as it stood at that time: May v O’Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658; Regina v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31 at [31].
	
	
	In Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court said at 212 and 214:
	


There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.

…

It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory (as to which see Whitehorn, Chamberlain v. The Queen (No.2) [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 and Morris v. The Queen [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454) nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process (as to which see Jago v. District Court (N.S.W.) [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23) provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial.

Application of Brian Brown


	
	In her opening the Crown said this relevantly to Brian Brown:
	


It is the Crown case that the three of them were acting together; that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill, or at the very least to inflict grievous bodily harm on Steve Mitrovic.

To find each of the accused guilty you would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they were part of the joint criminal enterprise to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Steve Mitrovic.

At the time Wade Basanovic fired the gun, the accused intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Steve Mitrovic.

…

The three accused intended to cause a really serious injury at that time [that Michael Bell was shot] to Steve Mitrovic. So, that is the intention to cause grievous bodily harm that is charged in relation to the Michael Bell shooting. Again, in relation to that charge, the three accused are all guilty of the offence regarding Michael Bell if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the three of them were acting together, that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill Steve Mitrovic. That is an outline of the Crown case in this matter.


	
	The evidence relied upon in the Crown case to show that Brian Brown was part of the joint criminal enterprise can be summarised as follows:
	


(1)   Brian Brown had been a member of the Hells Angels;

(2)   He was present with Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic when the two cars were at the service station before the shooting, proved largely by the DNA on the chicken wings found in the rubbish bin at the service station;

(3)   He went up into the offices of Dynamic Transport with the other two accused and argued with the deceased;

(4)   He was walking away from the group at the time Michael Basanovic nodded to Wade Basanovic immediately before the shooting;

(5)   He got into the silver sedan which had moved close to the exit to the Dynamic Transport offices and the car sped away from the scene;

(6)   He left the country the next day by buying a one way air ticket to Chile.


	
	The Crown also sought to rely on evidence given by Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic as follows:
	


(7)   There were two meetings at Mr Brown’s place where an arrangement was made for Frank Bacic to set up a meeting on behalf of Michael Basanovic with the deceased. These meetings took place on 13 and 14 January 2013;

(8)   Mr Brown had been asked by Steve Mitrovic to arrange for Michael Basanovic to be positioned to enable him to be killed and had been offered $100,000 to do so.


	
	There was evidence from Wade Basanovic that neither Michael Basanovic nor Brian Brown knew that he, Wade, had the gun in his pocket when they went up to speak to Steve Mitrovic. Michael Basanovic also gave evidence that he was unaware that Wade had a gun at that time.
	
	
	Wade Basanovic said that he took the gun up with him because he did not feel safe without it. That was because he knew Steve always had a gun or had someone with a gun with him. He was asked how did he know that and he said:
	


I was told by dad and Brownie and people were saying they know Steve.


	
	In cross-examination Wade said that he mixed that up and that Mr Brown told him this after the events because he “never spoke to Brownie about Steve”. For the purposes of the present application it must be accepted that there is evidence for the Crown at its highest that Mr Brown knew that Steve always had a gun or had someone with him who had a gun.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to Wade Basanovic’s evidence that in the car after the shooting Mr Brown had said, “What the fuck was that?” The Crown pointed out that Michael Basanovic’s evidence was that nothing was said in the car afterwards. The Crown ultimately accepted that whether the words were said or not, the evidence was neutral as far as Mr Brown having any knowledge prior to the shooting either that Wade had a gun or that there was an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Mitrovic when they went to his premises.
	
	
	In my opinion, when all of this evidence is taken at its highest there is simply no evidence upon which the jury could find that Brian Brown was part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Steve Mitrovic. There is sufficient evidence to show an agreement between Mr Brown and the two co-accused to attend at the deceased’s premises. If the evidence of Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic is accepted the jury could infer that Mr Brown knew that they were intending to go to the premises to try to sort out the problem that Michael Basanovic found himself in, believing both that the deceased had offered Mr Brown $100,000 to position Michael Basanovic to be killed and, in any event, that Steve Mitrovic had a contract out on Michael Basanovic’s life. There is no evidence, however, from which the jury could infer that Mr Brown was aware that there was any intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm on Steve Mitrovic nor that Mr Brown was aware that Wade Basanovic was carrying a gun when they went up to Mr Mitrovic’s offices.
	
	
	The evidence that Mr Brown left the country the following day on a one way ticket does not, without anything more, enable the jury to infer that he did so because he knew before he went to the premises either that Wade Basanovic was carrying a gun or that there was any intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The Crown cannot in the first instance point to any arrangement to kill Mr Mitrovic before Brian Brown is involved in going with them to the premises. The strongest piece of evidence in the circumstantial case that is the joint criminal enterprise is the nod from father to son just before the shooting. That piece of evidence works to give some colour and emphasis to earlier matters that were arranged between father and son including even the arrangement to have Mr Brown accompany them. But there is nothing but speculation that Brian Brown was let into any arrangement that father and son had to murder or inflict grievous bodily harm on Steve Mitrovic.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict Mr Brown of either offence charged.
	


Application of Michael Basanovic


	
	Mr Korn for Michael Basanovic submitted that the Crown case was and had always been that there was an agreement between the three accused to go there that day and kill Mr Mitrovic. Mr Korn submitted that the Crown case had never been that there was some stepped process whereby they would go to speak to Mr Mitrovic to try and negotiate and resolve the matter but if that did not work out there was an agreement that Mr Mitrovic would be killed. Mr Korn submitted that the evidence of such an arrangement being inferred would be stronger if the only two accused were Michael and Wade Basanovic, partly at least because of the nature of their relationship. However, the matter has been put involving Mr Brown to the same extent.
	
	
	Mr Korn submitted that the Crown had never embraced the nod from Michael Basanovic to his son as being some part of a conditional arrangement. Mr Korn’s principal point appeared to be that the way the Crown had put its case was an all or nothing three way arrangement whereas the evidence of the nod could only be seen as part of a conditional arrangement between Michael Basanovic and his son Wade. In that way, because there was no evidence of Mr Brown’s involvement in the nod, there was nothing to go to the jury against Michael Basanovic by reason of the way the Crown had put its case.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is evidence capable of going to the jury of an agreement reached between Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic to kill Steve Mitrovic. Accepting the Crown’s case at its highest, the nod given by father to son immediately before the shooting suggests an arrangement had been made between them. Other circumstantial evidence which the jury can use in that regard is the following:
	


(1)   The evidence of the meeting at Mr Brown’s place with Mr Bacic about arranging a meeting with the deceased;

(2)   The relaying of that arrangement from Michael Basanovic to Wade Basanovic;

(3)   The knowledge that Wade Basanovic had that his father was bashed by or at the instigation of the deceased at the club house;

(4)   The knowledge that Wade had from his father that the police had informed him that there was a contract out on his life;

(5)   The knowledge that Wade had from his father about the visit of the Hells Angels to his grandparents’ place around new year 2013;

(6)   The evidence that Michael Basanovic had been carrying a gun with him since moving to Brighton Le Sands and Wade’s knowledge of that gun including where in the car it was kept;

(7)   The evidence of the visit to the offices of Dynamic Transport with a group of solid male support preceded by Wade ascertaining that the deceased had no support himself before Wade would ring his father to let him know to come to the Dynamic Transport premises.


	
	I do not accept Mr Korn’s submission about the way the Crown has put its case. If any criticism can e made of the Crown it would go to a lack of specificity about the joint criminal enterprise. The Crown made it clear that the last time at which the agreement was made was at the point when Wade Basanovic rang his father from Dynamic transport’s yard after having spoken to Steve Mitrovic.
	
	
	Although the Crown’s case was that all three accused were part of the arrangement, it was never suggested that the arrangement was made at the one time when all three were present together. The presence and involvement of Mr Brown was not essential to the existence of an arrangement between Wade and his father. There was no evidence suggesting a specific or essential role for Mr Brown.
	
	
	The jury could not on the evidence have convicted Mr Brown because the highest the evidence went was an agreement to attend at the deceased’s premises in company for some purpose involving Michael Basanovic. The additional evidence of the knowledge by Wade of the existence and whereabouts of his father’s gun, the statements from Wade to Steve Mitrovic that he did not protect his father made with Wade’s knowledge of his father’s bashing, and the nod from father to son followed by the shooting all enable inferences to be drawn by the jury that a joint criminal enterprise to kill did exist.
	


Conclusion


	
	In relation to Brian Brown the jury will be directed to find him not guilty on both Counts.
	
	
	In relation to Michael Basanovic the no-case application is refused.

2702888,Bugden; Halper v R [2015] NSWDC 346,"Judgment


	
	I am sitting on circuit in Bega. On Wednesday I heard two appeals from sentences imposed by a Local Court magistrate. They were both sentence appeals. In each case I made an order under s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That order had the effect that both of the appellants would leave court without a conviction on their record. I said that I would deliver my reasons today and these are my reasons for making that decision in both cases.
	
	
	The offence each man was charged with was the same. It was driving a car with an illicit drug present in his blood. The drug was cannabis.
	
	
	Klaus Halper committed the offence on 26 March this year. He was driving into town from where he lives - a distance of nearly 100 kilometres - to do his weekly shopping. It was a Thursday. He had smoked some cannabis the previous weekend. Police tested him and the test was positive. He pleaded guilty before his Honour Magistrate Dick who fined him $400 and reduced the automatic disqualification of six months to the permissible minimum of three months.
	
	
	The second case was Beau Bugden, a young 20 year old man finishing his apprenticeship as a chef. As it happens he committed the same offence on the same day as Mr Halper. Again he was pulled over by police for a random drug test and returned a positive reading for cannabis. In his case he admitted smoking some cannabis about three days beforehand. He too pleaded guilty and his Honour fined him the same amount and reduced the disqualification from six months to three months.
	
	
	The offence which both of them committed is created by s 111(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW). It is an offence of driving while there is an illicit drug present in the driver’s system.
	
	
	I should say a little more about each case and why I sent them away without a conviction.
	
	
	In Mr Halper’s case he was called to give evidence by his lawyer, Ms I Chiumento. He had had a very serious car accident many years ago and was put on a regime of strong prescription painkillers for many years. He told me that he was “dealing with a whole bunch of side effects that had nothing to do with the accident, that had everything to do with the medications that I was on”. He said that he was not functioning and that instead of the strong medication he smoked cannabis and it helps him. As I said, the last time he smoked before that Thursday was the Sunday evening.
	
	
	I accept his evidence that he does not drink and drive. As he said, he looks after his licence: “It’s vital for my existence.” He lives some kilometres from his nearest neighbour and, as I said, drives nearly 100 kilometres to do his weekly shopping. This includes visiting and obtaining products from a naturopath. To my mind the circumstances in which the offence was committed were extenuating and for those reasons I regarded an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as appropriate in his case. He is also a local musician and needs his car for that reason as well. His account was supported by references.
	
	
	Beau Bugden has nearly finished his apprenticeship as a chef. He has no criminal record whatsoever, although he has attracted a couple of tickets for low level speeding and not displaying a P‑plate. He also took his eyes off the road some years ago. The police saw him weaving across the road and he was booked for negligent driving. He has good references by people who have known him almost all his life and who attest to his good character and the lesson he has learned. He told me in evidence that he had smoked his first joint about three days beforehand. His good character and lack of criminal record was the basis of my decision to send him away without a conviction.
	
	
	Ms Chiumento, who appeared for both men, developed some submissions after I heard Mr Halper’s case about the rigorous nature of the offence. What I mean by that is, the offence itself is one of having the illicit drug simply present in one’s bodily system. It is not an offence of driving under its influence. She pointed out that in other jurisdictions the test is more finely tuned and is aimed at detecting a level of the drug which would affect driving. I myself have not looked into this but I accept what she says. Her client, Mr Halper, also gave evidence about his researches. Again, I say I have not undertaken these researches myself nor sought any submissions about the topic.
	
	
	What also became apparent from Mr Halper’s evidence, and indeed from Mr Bugden’s evidence, is that cannabis remains present in one’s system for quite some time after it is taken. It occurred to me during argument that Parliament may not have realised that in enacting the legislation. However, a reading of the second reading speech given by Mr Matt Brown on behalf of Mr David Campbell on 19 September 2006 makes it clear that there “will be no need for police to prove that a person’s driving was impaired; it need only be proved that the drug was present in the person’s sample. This sends a clear message to motorists that driving with any amount of these illegal drugs in the body is not tolerated in New South Wales”. The other two drugs that Mr Brown was referring to were amphetamines and ecstasy. I am not using their chemical names.
	
	
	It occurred to me that I should draw to Parliament’s attention the effect of the legislation, given the long lasting property of cannabis. However, I realise that I do not need to do that because clearly Parliament’s intention was to prohibit driving with any traces of the illegal drug present in a person’s system. This makes some sense given that the drug itself is illegal and people should not have it in their systems.
	
	
	But there was another reason I had in mind for reserving my reasons for the decision. That is that some users of the drug may not be aware of how long it stays in the system and that days later they can be charged with this offence and put their licences at risk. The drug itself is prohibited but the experience of the courts is that usage is not uncommon. Like alcohol it can mark the commencement of years of addiction when taken by vulnerable people. But on the other hand its use therapeutically is being investigated. Indeed in Mr Halper’s case the use was evidently beneficial. He made it clear that he used it discreetly in the privacy of his own home. Mr Bugden’s case was one of a young man trying it for the first time.
	
	
	I will direct that these reasons be published. This is not for the purpose of drawing the attention of Parliament to the effect of the legislation because Parliament intended the legislation to have just that effect. However, people who use the drug illicitly but privately need to be aware that if they are driving some days or more afterwards the drug may well be detected in their system and their licence will be at risk. This is particularly significant for people who, like Mr Halper, live in the country and need their car for normal purposes such as shopping or work.
	
	
	I am not encouraging people to use the drug. As I said, the experience of the courts is that it can mark the commencement of dangerous addictions like alcohol. But those who do use it need to do some research and know that they are not only exposing themselves to prosecution for possession or use of the drug but also putting their driver licence at risk.

		03 February 2016",2015-08-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702889,R v Whitby [2015] NSWDC 287,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: In October 2010 I sentenced David Shane Whitby for a very large number of offences primarily involving the sexual assaults of children. I imposed 105 separate sentences. The effective overall sentence was a period of imprisonment for 32 years with a non-parole period of 26 years.
	
	
	Some considerable time later I was alerted to a possible error in relation to a sentence I imposed for one particular count. It is apparent that staff at the Judicial Commission, when compiling sentencing statistics, realised that I had imposed on count 19 a sentence which was longer than the maximum penalty for that offence. They were concerned for two reasons, firstly they were not sure how to reflect my order in the statistics kept by the Commission, but secondly, and more importantly, they were concerned that I had made an error.
	
	
	Mr Hugh Donnelly, from the Judicial Commission, wrote to me alerting me to this potential problem. I have reviewed the matter and I am satisfied that I have fallen into error as Mr Donnelly suggested.
	
	
	Accordingly I had my Associate contact the Prosecution and attempt to contact lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Whitby. It is apparent that now no lawyer holds instructions from Mr Whitby. Accordingly the solicitor from the DPP wrote to Mr Whitby alerting him to this issue and advising him of a suggestion that was to be made by the Prosecution which would correct the error.
	
	
	Mr Whitby has appeared unrepresented today, I have spoken to him about what I propose to do and he said that he did not wish to make any submissions regarding that proposal.
	
	
	Accordingly I re-open the sentencing proceedings under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Instead of the sentence which I imposed on count 19 on 8 October 2010 I will sentence Mr Whitby on that count as follows: I sentence him to imprisonment with a head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years. No other sentence for any other count is to be changed. I confirm that that alteration makes no change at all to the overall effective sentence, thus the date on which Mr Whitby’s non-parole period expires and the date on which his head sentence expires remains the same.

2702892,R v Thomas Kerr [2015] NSWDC 237,"Judgment

Charges


	
	Mr Hughes appears for the Crown on instructions from the DPP and Mr Thangaraj of Senior Counsel instructed by KM Legal for the offender.
	
	
	Thomas Kerr has pleaded guilty to seven counts on indictment namely, firstly, four counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW. The maximum penalty for an offence of this nature under this section is seven years imprisonment. The victims named in each of those four identical counts are Paul Haber, Anthony Anderson, Hans Dean and Gillian Anderson.
	
	
	The offender also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing bodily harm by misconduct pursuant to s 53 of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW. The maximum penalty for an offence under this section is two years imprisonment. The victims named in each of those three identical counts are Gus De Souza, Bharat Mistry and Bryce Dean.
	
	
	There is also a charge listed on a s 166 certificate, namely a negligent driving charge, and I will return to the Crown at the conclusion of these remarks to ask what application is made in relation to that certificate.
	


Facts


	
	A brief outline of the facts is that on 16 March 2014 between 8.30am and 8.35am Mr Kerr was driving his black Nissan X-Trail SUV motor vehicle on Southern Cross Drive near Eastlakes. He was driving in a northerly direction on lane 1. The precise location of the section of Southern Cross Drive is set out in the agreed facts and the photographs which accompany those agreed facts.
	
	
	Ahead of him were a group of at least seven cyclists travelling in columns in the same direction. They had been driving in what was referred to as a peloton formation whereby one group would overtake another group in the course of their journey and that group would then in turn be overtaken.
	
	
	The offender collided with members of the group and significant injuries were caused to a number of them. They were taken by ambulance to St Vincent’s Hospital as well as to St George Hospital for treatment. The seventh rider was able to ride his bike from the scene.
	
	
	Mr Kerr was arrested at the scene of the collision, his blood and urine were analysed and returned a negative reading to the presence of alcohol. He was alone in the vehicle at the time of impact. He was subsequently charged and interviewed. He said that he remembered driving around the corner of Southern Cross Drive into the area preceding where the collision took place. That was his last recollection of the events until after the collision.
	
	
	He heard a loud thump and recalls noticing a cyclist protruding from under the bottom of the car. He then slammed on the brakes.
	
	
	In terms of conditions, at the time of the collision the weather was warm and clear, visibility was good, the surface of the road was dry. The road was also in good condition and free of any obstacles. It is unclear to me whether there was any sun streaming into the eyes of the offender at that time although I note that the incident occurred at about 8.30am. The road was bituminised and in good condition and free of any obstacles.
	
	
	Photographs have been tendered of the scene of the collision, and photographs were also tendered of the damaged bikes at the scene. Many of them were extensively damaged.
	
	
	All seven cyclists involved belonged to the Eastern Suburbs Cycling Club. All were experienced riders and had a practice of cycling on public roads around the nearby area in groups of up to ten or 12.
	
	
	At the time of the collision the cyclists had passed through the Southern Cross Drive airport tunnel and were heading along the road as part of what was generally anticipated to be a three hour trip. Their practice, as I have said, was to travel in columns or lines such that one column replaced the other from time to time. That was done deliberately in order to minimise traffic problems. These were cyclists who were aware of what they were doing and were acting lawfully and in accordance with safety requirements – and with regard to public safety.
	
	
	The cycling route followed by them took up one lane towards the left hand side of that lane. They were travelling at approximately 32 kilometres per hour and were fitted with appropriate safety precautions. They were wearing distinctive, red, white and blue or generic cycling jerseys. They were all wearing helmets. There is no suggestion the group or any of them was responsible in any way for the collision.
	
	
	The agreed facts also state that traffic at the time was at a moderate level which could be anticipated, as I say, given the time and date, namely, at or about 8.30am on a Sunday in March.
	


Witnesses


	
	In terms of independent witnesses, an independent witness, Mr Stuart White, observed the offender’s vehicle in his rear vision mirror and described it as careering right through the middle group of cyclists – “like a tenpin ball through a set of skittles”. Mr White saw a couple of riders go over the top of the offender’s vehicle.
	
	
	There is no doubting the severity of the collision. Mr White saw two cyclists go up and over the top of the vehicle, one on either side. There was a rider under the bottom of the vehicle who had been pushed forward and the bike remained underneath the front fender. Mr White saw Mr Kerr walking up and down the shoulder of the road looking shocked and distressed. He said “I didn’t see them I was just changing lanes, I didn’t see them at all.” Mr White’s observation was that he did not recall seeing the offender changing lanes.
	
	
	Another independent witness, Mr John Umay, was also travelling in a northerly direction in lane 3 with his cruise control set at 80 kilometres per hour. He recalled that Mr Kerr’s vehicle was not travelling as fast as he was but that the vehicles were almost parallel with each other when impact occurred. I infer from that that the offender was travelling at slightly below the speed limit. Mr Umay said that the offender did not slow down and did nothing to go around the cyclists. There was no indicator being used. Mr Umay saw Mr Kerr put his brake lights on. After he had collided with the cyclists, he seemed to start veering towards the second lane but not in a sudden motion. It was a slight veering before he collided with the cyclists. Mr Umay also stated that the offender was always in lane 1 and that he had “ample time to move across the lanes into it, he just didn’t do it.”
	
	
	Another witness, Mr Colin Vickers, was travelling behind the offender’s vehicle. He said that he saw bikes and the four-wheel drive just did not move, it did not stop, it was going straight into the back of all the bikes so the bikes were going to the left as he was veering to the right. He saw that the offender’s vehicle ploughed into the back of them and slightly off centre.
	
	
	A passenger in Mr Vicker’s car, Mr Christian Vickers, also said that he saw a black four-wheel drive going “a bit fast, a little bit erratic ... the car kind of went straight into them at full speed ... which resulted in him kind of going to the right, there was no braking, nothing, just straight into them.”
	
	
	A further independent witness, Mr Pen Martin, appears to have observed the events after the collision in particular in relation to what the offender said and I will come to that later in these remarks.
	


Explanations for the accident


	
	In terms of any other explanation, a subsequent forensic examination of the vehicle concluded that there was no mechanical defect or failure with the vehicle that might have been a contributing factor towards the collision occurring. As I have said, there is no suggestion that any of the cyclists were in any way responsible for the accident.
	
	
	Mr Kerr’s immediate response after the collision involved him stopping and walking over to one of the cyclists and saying “I don’t know what happened I looked up and all of a sudden I started clipping you guys.”
	
	
	Mr Kerr later told his father that he was at a loss as to what had happened and was totally bewildered that he had run into a group of cyclists. He was unable to rationally explain what had happened.
	


Injuries


	
	It is clear that the victims on counts 1 to 4 have already suffered substantial harm. This is an element of the offence, and is not to be used in an aggravating sense. The same comment should be made in relation to the victims on the remaining, less serious but still important, counts.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	Victim impact statements have been received from Dr Paul Haber, Gillian McDonald, Hans Dean and Bryce Dean. In relation to all the victim impact statements tendered, the approach to be followed is as is set out in the Act. I have clarified with the Crown and it appears that none of those who have made those statements have any objection to those matters being read. That was done given my concerns about the personal details of some of the impact of the accident on them and on their lives, their families and their financial affairs.
	
	
	I would ask the media to respect that privacy in relation to that aspect.
	
	
	What is clear is that the relevant elements of grievous bodily harm have been made out, as well as the causing of bodily harm and the circumstances do not go beyond that purpose.
	
	
	For the purpose of these remarks, it is important to canvass those victim impact statements in accordance with the provisions of the Act and take them into account as I do.
	


Paul Haber


	
	Dr Haber’s injuries are set out in the agreed facts which will be redacted and distributed. He has also provided a victim impact statement dated 1 March 2015. It is an extensive statement which I have corroborated with other aspects of the agreed facts. Suffice it to say he has had major health effects. He has undergone major spinal surgery on the day of the crash, to stabilise his spine and to prevent paraplegia. There was an unstable burst fracture of his second lumbar vertebrae, a lesser fracture of the other vertebrae and that necessitated a fusion of his entire lumbar spine. This involved and necessitated a lengthy and extremely painful recovery period in terms of his regaining his ability to walk and becoming increasingly mobile. He had a second operation in October to remove the hardware implanted in the first procedure.
	
	
	Set out over the course of the next ten paragraphs is a series of both understandable and totally reasonable concerns that he and his family have had in terms of his future health and the impact of those spinal injuries on him. He was 55 at the time of the injury and has suffered not just an impact on the immediate physical, mental and medical concerns, but on his lifestyle, such as difficulties in resuming cycling.
	
	
	That latter impact has been the case for all the victims in the circumstances, which can be expected. This was a hobby, an activity pursued by all of them as an appropriate, proper and laudable activity. It is devastating to them that they have had loss of this particular activity in the circumstances which occurred with absolutely no responsibility being attributed to them in any way. Dr Haber has also had property and financial losses. The impact on his private practice has been substantial. That at one stage led to the closure of his practice, with an impact on his income and his own interactions with new and existing patients. Also set out in that statement is his loss of work, the consequential difficulties for his family, the emotional strain on this family, the impact on him, and the work that he and his wife had been doing in a charitable area. It has had, as I say, a devastating impact on him.
	


Anthony Anderson


	
	Anthony Anderson’s victim impact statement his statement is referred to in paras 26 and 27 of the agreed facts. He was 67 at the time of the accident. He was knocked unconscious, he received abrasions, rib fractures, a deformed nose, a nasal bone fracture with a deviation, a condylar fracture, clavicular fractures, multiple rib fractures and burst fractures to L1. He required immediate surgery and pins above his vertebrae.
	


Hans Dean


	
	Hans Dean, 48 years old, was knocked unconscious. He had an occipital haematoma, altered sensations to his legs, abrasions to his hand, face, elbow and knees. He also had a burst fracture with a retro-pulse bony fragment. That required immediate surgical correction and the insertion of metal rods and screws on either side of his vertebrae. On any view, he too has suffered ongoing problems. I have re-read the victim impact statement which he has provided, particularly under the headings of ‘physical injuries’, the ‘emotional impact on his wellbeing’ and the ‘mental health impact’. The statement sets out the changes to his behaviour and attitude and the impact on his financial situation, his housing situation, and his employment. He did at that stage employ 10 office staff and 40 plus contractors around the country. That business has been significantly affected financially. He is back at work now but in a 40% capacity. The accident has had a direct impact on his private finances and the quality of his family’s life. He has had difficulties with insurance coverage and again, all those matters are entirely understandable and attributable directly to this accident.
	


Gillian Anderson


	
	Gillian Anderson’s victim impact statement refers to the impact on her as well as on Mr Anthony Anderson, her partner. She deposes to the details in the statement dated 19 August 2015. Her major injury was to her right arm which involved complex partial de-gloving, lacerations and a tearing of her ulna nerve. She had surgery the day after the injury to close some of the wounds on her arm and on her leg. There has been some growth to the nerve but it has been very difficult to her in ways which again are understandable, and without going into those details or impinging on her right to privacy, she has had extensive treatment which was necessary. The consequences of the accident have taken a great deal of time out of her life and has had a major impact on her, her partner, her family and on her lifestyle. She says it has taken her almost a year to feel comfortable to ride a bike again and only riding in Centennial Park.
	


Bryce Dean


	
	There is another statement by Mr Bryce Dean I have re-read a certificate from the completing doctors in terms of the impact on his nasal break, the right elbow, the grazes, and also the impact on his lifestyle which has been extensive. It is probably unnecessary to go through all of the relevant matters in detail.
	


Gus De Souza and Bharat Mistry


	
	I have examined all of the remaining statements and comments concerning Mr Desousa, and Mr Mistry.
	
	
	On any view, this was a devastating collision with consequences which were both far-reaching and ongoing and in some cases permanent. They are significant injuries and consequences and they must be reflected in a sentence which reflects the objects of sentencing.
	


Offender’s personal circumstances


	
	Mr Kerr’s personal circumstances are that he is aged 28, he is the youngest of three sons. He grew up in the southern suburbs of Sydney where he was educated. He is single and lives with his parents. He received what can only be described as supportive parenting and an upbringing in which he was able to excel in various areas including rugby league. After completing his secondary education he has held various positions and now works in the sports wagering and gaming industry. At one stage he ran his own fitness centre called Charge Forward Fitness which he did for some three to five years. That is a tribute to his initiative and work values.
	


Prior convictions


	
	However, what stands out and which cannot be ignored is that he has had a prior criminal conviction for affray, apparently resulting initially in a sentence of periodic detention. That was set aside on appeal and replaced with a community service order which he completed, it seems, apparently satisfactorily. He had an additional conviction for aggravated robbery in 2012 for which he was subject to a two year intensive correction order which commenced in May 2013 and which was obviously still in force at the time of this incident.
	
	
	Defence counsel submitted from the bar table that the circumstances of that offence was that it occurred after a funeral and some considerable drinking by him with others. Whatever the circumstances – and it clearly did not relate to driving – it was something that was serious. However, given that it was an aggravated robbery charge and there was an intensive correction order imposed, it would presumably not have been at the upper end of what was the common range of sentences in relation to aggravated robbery matters.
	


Driving record


	
	What is a concern to me also is the offender’s driving record. He was disqualified from driving for two years in 2010. There was an associated charge of using a mobile phone for which he was fined. I interpolate to say that I have assumed that the police have made inquiries and that there is no suggestion of any mobile phone being used in this particular instance of this collision. He was also charged for driving whilst disqualified it seems also in 2010.
	
	
	He had a conviction in 2009 for driving with a mid‑range PCA for which he was fined. He was sent a letter at that stage notifying him that he was being warned in relation to the actual offence under the habitual offender provisions.
	
	
	Neither the criminal history nor the traffic record assist him in any way at all. While it cannot be used as an aggravating factor, it is of considerable concern. The view I take it that does indicate a continuing disregard of the legal provisions in relation to restrictions relating to road usage and the way that impacts on him.
	
	
	On one view, and without knowing the full details of those offences, he was extended some considerable leniency in relation to the various sentencing options which were extended to him over that four to five year period preceding this particular collision.
	


Evidence on the sentencing proceedings


	
	Mr Kerr did not give evidence. By consent and without opposition from the Crown, the offender read a prepared statement of remorse to the victims in open court. I permitted that because it seemed important to the victims to be able to hear that directly from Mr Kerr. Some of those victims were present others did not wish to be present.
	
	
	There was a perception by some of the victims apparent in their statements that those expressions of remorse by Mr Kerr were absent until late in these proceedings. This may have arisen, according to Mr Kerr, from the advice given to him by previous legal representatives about pursuing that course. Whatever the situation was, that statement was made in the context of sentencing proceedings. It was made without the offender either giving sworn evidence or being available for cross-examination. It is therefore untested.
	
	
	For what it is worth, in my view, the offender was genuine in his expressions of remorse which I have taken into account in terms of the discount which is appropriate given his plea of guilty. But in terms of its legal classification, it is akin to a letter being tendered from the offender. It is untested and I give it limited weight other than on the question of remorse particularly it does leave open the issue of what was the reason for the inattention that was given in the driving that occurred.
	
	
	The end result is that this is a situation where because I give the oral statement limited weight other than questions of remorse, I am left with no adequate explanation here about the cause for this collision. The submissions, therefore, made on his behalf by Mr Thangaraj SC – that the only conclusion available is that the incident was the result of a lapse of concentration – remain as conjecture only.
	
	
	I should also indicate that if that practice is to be followed in this court it should be borne in mind that dock statements have been abolished. The law is very clear as was specified recently by the High Court in terms of situations of untested evidence and what evidence a trial judge or a sentencing judge can have regard to in those circumstances.
	
	
	Additional sworn evidence was given by the witnesses Mr Barry Kerr and Ms Linda Osborne. Mr Kerr is the offender’s father. He gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings that he believes his son is hard-working and has modest values. He still regularly visits his grandmother who has dementia and that is in his favour. He suffered from a knee injury while playing rugby league at a senior level. Mr Barry Kerr said that the offender’s knee injury was described by the doctors as being a very bad injury. He, the offender, struggled to get over it and the subsequent treatment and that was to his credit that he did so.
	
	
	It was interesting and indeed appropriate for the offender to remark on the fact that he has had difficulties with such injuries and knows to some, albeit limited, extent what the victims have gone through. These victims have gone through considerable amounts in terms of the very serious medical issues that they have had directly following from this accident. They are in no way comparable to what Mr Kerr himself had.
	
	
	Mr Barry Kerr said that he had a heart attack in 2007 and, in addition to this, he had some financial difficulties. He has had to sell his home and to alleviate the financial strain Mr Barry Kerr said his son, Thomas Kerr, and his two brothers assisted him financially. He, Thomas Kerr, gives his parents $300 each week. Mr Barry Kerr said that he visited the offender in hospital and said that at that time he was in shock However, notwithstanding that, his major concern was for the victims’ health and physical state. I accept that evidence. It was sworn evidence.
	
	
	Mr Kerr’s father said that the offender was a good driver, an opinion which in my view is not consistent with Mr Thomas Kerr’s prior traffic and criminal record. When asked whether he was aware of the full statement of the offender’s driving record he said he was only aware of two of the convictions.
	
	
	Ms Linda Osborne also gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings. She said she knew the offender through her daughter who had been in a relationship with the offender for some time. She said she trusted him completely including having him drive her daughter around on numerous occasions. She also said that the offender had travelled with her and the family on two separate occasions, once to Bali and another time to the USA. On that latter occasion she allowed him to drive her. She did not know of the detail of the offender’s driving record rather she said that when the offender and his brothers were out at night her understanding and experience of them was that if they were drinking that night then they would always catch a taxi home. When asked, she said she was aware of Mr Kerr’s prior conviction for mid‑range PCA. She said that she had heard of that offence through her daughter.
	
	
	There does not seem to be an attempt to either mislead the Court in these references. However, they do minimise in my view a knowledge of the offender’s driving record which as I say does not assist him at all.
	
	
	There were other references tendered to the offender’s character. His mother Shirley Kerr provided a statement which she detailed both her concerns, the impact on him and the family and, in particular, his ongoing anxiety. There are also references provided by Mr Rix and Mr Robert Osborne who said that he had always considered the offender as being a responsible driver. Mr Owsnett also gave his opinion that the offender was a responsible driver.
	
	
	How all that sits with the offender’s driving record is unclear to me – particularly as to whether those witnesses were aware of that record. However, the references were otherwise generally confirmatory of the offender’s secure and stable upbringing, his family support and his support to them, his interests and his character. I will take those matters into account in relation to those aspects.
	


Medical report: offender


	
	In terms of medical opinion as to what might have been the cause of the incident, a report was provided from a Dr Robert Bezic which set out firstly that he has been Mr Kerr’s general medical practitioner since 1993. He said that Mr Kerr was initially prescribed treatment for anxiety which caused “significant and sometimes disabling symptoms” up to around about the period of September 2011. That appears to have ceased by December 2011. Dr Bezic says that Mr Kerr’s anxiety disorder has improved significantly apart from the stresses associated with the sentencing proceedings; again, that is to be expected. Dr Bezic said that Mr Kerr did not suffer any significant side effects with the prescribed drug Lexapro and withdrew off the medication. There is no suggestion that the withdrawal caused any cognitive lapses or ongoing problems. There is also no suggestion of any medical cause for any inattention, lapse of judgment or lack of concentration at the relevant time.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown specified in submissions that there is no suggestion made by the Crown that the offender drove deliberately at the group of cyclists or any of them. There is no suggestion, and again I want to emphasise this, of any road rage, or the offender’s driving, or the collision arising out of, for example, frustration at not being able to overtake the cyclists.
	
	
	The Crown reminded the Court that the offender was on an intensive correction order at the time of the offence. Although this was for an offence of affray – a different offence from that involved here – the Crown submitted that it is still of relevance in relation to the opportunities afforded to the offender and the sentencing options in particular. I think that is correct. The Crown further submitted that the offender’s speed should be considered in light of the circumstances. The Crown submitted that, if the offender was travelling at a speed of at or about 70 kilometres an hour, where the cyclists were travelling at 32 kilometres an hour that means he was travelling at about 40 kilometres an hour more than them. The Crown submitted that hat was unsafe in the circumstances where there was not an adequate lookout being maintained. The cyclists must have been visible that morning to a distance of at least 300 metres. It is clear that the distance would have taken about 17 seconds to complete or thereabouts. The Crown submitted that in those circumstances the sight of a group of that many cyclists must have been one that gave rise to vigilant caution on any driver’s part in these circumstances. Clearly there were other cars around on what is, on any view, a major road in Sydney carrying airport traffic as well as traffic from the southern suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	That much of those submissions is clearly correct. Even though the offender was travelling below the speed limit, a driver’s speed must be considered by any responsible driver in the light of the circumstances relevant at the time. Here those circumstances included the fact that there were cyclists travelling both appropriately, safely, and in the lane ahead of him at the time. He must have been aware of them for some considerable period of time, even if it was measured in seconds. Seventeen seconds is a long time for anybody driving on a straight road in clear conditions.
	
	
	In response to the defence submissions that this was a case of momentary inattention, the Crown reiterated that the relevant driving was over a distance of 300 metres and a period of some 17 seconds. In those circumstances the Crown submitted, in my view appropriately, that this is in the context of driving and the breach could not be classified as either momentary or fleeting. The Crown did not concede that the offender had a blackout. In my view there is no evidence to support that finding. I have considered the medical evidence and his accounts to the police and other authorities both subsequently and contemporaneously. There is no relevant medical history that could conclude or enable a finding that such a blackout did occur. The precise cause for the incident and the collision remains an unknown fact.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that on the evidence it was open for the Court to find special circumstances, which I propose to do for reasons I will subsequently outline, and a 25% discount to the sentence for the early plea would be appropriate and proper in these circumstances.
	


Defence submissions


	
	Mr Thangaraj SC for the offender submitted that there should be a finding of low moral culpability as part of his overall submission that an appropriate sentence would be one of full time imprisonment to be carried out by way of an alternative such as an intensive correction order. Defence counsel points out that the offender pleaded guilty at an early occasion in the Local Court. I have tried to track down through the date when that occurred precisely, but I think it is classified appropriately as an early occasion.
	
	
	Mr Thangaraj SC went on to submit that the plea and the continuation of it is indicative of the offender’s remorse and that that is reflected in the statement he made in open court to the victims. I agree with that submission. He submitted that specific deterrence is not a relevant consideration in this case given the personal circumstances. I disagree with that submission and I will indicate why in further remarks. Further to that he submitted that general deterrence should not loom large in the consideration of what is an appropriate penalty. I disagree with that submission also.
	
	
	Mr Thangaraj SC submitted that the authorities for these kinds of offences do not indicate that a term of full time imprisonment is the only available sentence in the circumstances. Rather, he submitted that an intensive correction order or home detention or other alternative to full time imprisonment would appropriately and adequately meet the requirements of personal general deterrence. I disagree with that submission in this case for the reasons I will outline. He submitted that momentary inattention must have been almost at the point of impact because, if it was any earlier, it would not be possible that the car would have been driving in that manner in a straight line or, on some accounts, while slightly veering. In my view, in the absence of any evidence, that is a matter for conjecture. It is not necessary for me to accept the offender’s unsworn account in these circumstances and I do not propose to do so.
	
	
	In response to the Crown’s submission that a sentence of full time imprisonment was appropriate, Mr Thangaraj SC reminds me that the terms of the guidelines in the cases of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252; (2002) 134 A Crim R 53; [2002] NSWCCA 343. Specifically, he says that those two authorities do not contain any guideline cases involving momentary inattention in the absence of aggravating factors. He further submits that none of the aggravating factors that are relevant to moral culpability can be found in this case. I disagree with those submissions.
	
	
	The precise terms of Whyte were per Chief Justice Spigelman at [214]:
	


“the guideline of this Court should give pursuant to s 37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act with respect to the typical case identified above is that a custodial sentence would usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement.”


	
	Mr Thangaraj SC submitted that the test is not whether there was or was not inattention but the degree of inattention. The driving was deliberate only in the sense he submits that it was a voluntary act but not a deliberate act as far as the collision is concerned. He then submitted that the facts of this offence are to be treated differently in that, in this case, a momentary inattention, if that is what is found, does not equate to a breach in the traditional sense. He also reminded me that the offender was clearly driving within the speed limit. He then submitted that there are no other factors of criminality other than his inattention to the cyclists.
	
	
	As I said, there is no rational explanation for the cause of the collision other than the offender’s driving. I do not regard this case as being one of momentary inattention. Defence counsel also submitted that while the plea has not been traversed, there is no “guilty intent” associated with the driving. Defence counsel further submitted that the character of the accused is indicated by the fact that he immediately went to look after the victims. He certainly went to talk to them and he was co-operative and, indeed, handed over his licence after the incident as is set out in the document marked exhibit 20. I note that that was done some ten days later on 26 March 2014, apparently on at least medical advice at that time. Defence counsel finally submitted that given the nature and extent of the injuries to the various victims, the Court should be careful not to conflate the criminality of the driving and the consequences of it, and I have been mindful of that consideration.
	
	
	The decisions of Jurisic and Whyte make it clear that the moral culpability of the offender should be assessed against nine factors which I have considered. It seems to me that, firstly, the degree of speed relative to the circumstances and the driving conditions is relevant, as well as item number 5 of those guidelines, the length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. Here the distance travelled was some 300 metres.
	
	
	There are a number of other authorities which are necessary to be set out for the purpose of these reasons and in terms of my overall consideration. They include R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32 where Justice Simpson said that,
	


“offences under s 52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and the abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum rather than a dichotomy when assessing moral culpability.”


	
	That was the approach taken in the decision of R v Howland (1999) 104 A Crim R 273. That approach was also in line with that stated in Regina v Foster (2001) 33 MVR 565. There is, for example, inattention which falls between the momentary and that which could be described as an abandonment of responsibility, and I need to look at that spectrum or range given these circumstances. I have also considered and referred counsel to the decision of The Queen v Kyle [2014] NSWCCA 30 in the context of a sentence which should be imposed in cases concerning dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. In that decision the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a sentence of three years with a non-parole period of one year and nine months was manifestly inadequate for an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, and in that case that sentence did not reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the offender.
	
	
	Mr Thangaraj SC seeks to distinguish that case on its facts from the present on the basis that there the offender was driving over a distance of some 53 kilometres as distinct from here where it was 300 metres. There was a substantial breathalyser reading, albeit in the context of likely heavy drinking on the previous evening, and the following morning the appellant in that case woke up with a reading of above 0.2. Further involved in this case was driving where the appellant crossed over into the pathway of oncoming traffic. There were also distinguishing features in terms of the injuries suffered to the victim in that instance compared those suffered by the victims here. I do agree that that case of Kyle is different from this case by virtue of the period of driving involved, the degree and extent of the inattention involved, as well as the fact that that case was also a charge of aggravated driving under s 52A(4), which is not the case here under 52A(3). However, I need to be mindful of the general comments made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that instance.
	


General deterrence


	
	The Court needs to make it abundantly clear that cyclists who obey the law – as all the victims here were doing – have just as much right and entitlement to use the roads without danger or fear of being subject to such a random act of dangerous driving or, in the second category of offences, being caused serious harm.
	
	
	Drivers also need to be aware that they need to constantly pay attention to all traffic on the road and to be able to adjust their speed to take into account changing circumstances. Here those circumstances include the fact that there was a body of cyclists which were clearly visible on the road ahead of this offender. The sentence must mark the fact that this care was not present with the offender’s driving and indeed there was a significant breach of it. It was clearly dangerous. It was this inattention, the degree of it and the continuation of it, which was dangerous and which alone caused this accident.
	


Specific deterrence


	
	In general terms the offender is, apart from his driving record, a person of good character. He has been the product of a secure and stable upbringing with a sound work ethic. His driving record and to a limited extent the criminal record, subject to the matters of the breathalyser conviction, is only relevant to determining where a sentence should lie within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances of the offences, as was set out in The Queen v McNaughton (2006) 163 A Crim R 381 and is not to determine the objective seriousness of the offence. His record is relevant, as I say, to matters of personal deterrence and general deterrence.
	
	
	In my view, his record does indicate over the years prior to the commission of the offence a somewhat casual attitude towards the law and its applicability to him. It does not assist him at all, as I say, in the five years preceding this offence that were the matters that I have set out, and they are relatively serious transgressions where there have been a range of a series of non-custodial sentencing options extended to him. That leniency does not appear to have been recognised by him.
	
	
	There is nothing in Dr Bezic’s report in terms of his anxiety which impacts on the inappropriateness of a full time custodial sentence. As was said in R v Dutton [2005] NSWCCA 248 at [38], there is nothing to justify the exceptional step of suspending a sentence. The features that disadvantaged that offender were much more serious than is the case here.
	
	
	I have considered the factors that I have specified and indeed the general remarks in both Jurisic and Whyte. What is clear here from the nature of the driving, which I have found to be clearly dangerous given the distance and the time involved and all the other circumstances as outlined, is that this is more than a case of momentary inattention. Whatever term is used, be it a continual or a range or a level, what is needed is an assessment of the moral culpability as set out by Spigelman CJ in Jurisic at [228]. I do regard here the moral culpability as being significant and not minor. In terms of what was said in Whyte at [214] I also find that the level of culpability is above a low level and I find that with reference to the two particular factors I have identified as was set out in Gonzalez v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 4 at [13].
	
	
	There were seven victims. They were spread out over an area of a major road. It was not, for example, a situation of a single cyclist with an obscured vision, or somebody darting out into traffic, or a cyclist hitting a bump on a road and then going into a laneway. These were all cyclists travelling in what appears to me to be an experienced, almost quasi-professional way in accordance with the procedures they had adopted for the safety of themselves and the public.
	
	
	In terms of the spectrum of such cases referred to by Justice Simpson and the language sometimes used in other sentencing contexts, I assess the criminality to be well above the bottom end of the spectrum although closer to the lower end than the higher end.
	


Consideration


	
	What was involved was an act of clearly dangerous driving on a straight section of a major highway in Sydney. The weather was fine, the road was in good condition, it was bituminised. The offender’s view of the cyclists was unobstructed. There was no issue, mechanical or otherwise, with his car. There was no alcohol or drug use involved by him. As I have emphasised, the Crown is not relying on, nor does the available evidence suggest, that there was any element of deliberate driving at the cyclists or any of them. However, they were clearly visible. They had a perfect entitlement to be driving on the road in that formation. They were not in any way responsible for the collision. They did absolutely nothing to contribute to the collision.
	
	
	I am unable to find what was the reason for the offender’s manner of driving. He has not given sworn evidence. I do not accept the conjecture of a blackout. This matter remains essentially unexplained and I am therefore left to proceed, and do proceed, on the basis of the agreed facts.
	
	
	However, I need to specify that had there been any such evidence or element of deliberate driving or road rage, this sentencing proceeding would have proceeded on a very different basis. Here the four victims of the dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm counts have suffered extensive injuries. The three victims on the counts of driving causing actual bodily harm have suffered varying but still, in some cases, serious injuries. Many of the injuries were permanent and ongoing, and have had a significant impact on their lifestyle and their respective lives.
	


JIRS statistics


	
	I have considered the parameters of the JIRS statistics in relation to offences of this nature. However as is common with those statistics the facts of those cases are not known, along with the circumstances of the particular offenders. But those statistics in the broad, and as statistical samples only, would suggest that the sentence I am proposing is not outside permissible range and indeed reflects the findings as to criminality and the circumstances that I have outlined in these remarks without reiterating them.
	


Sentencing options


	
	It has been stressed by Mr Thangaraj SC in his urging that a sentencing option other than full-time imprisonment is available. He relied, and I have re-examined overnight, the decision of Dutton where Justice Howie made the comment that he did in considering the impact of a decision in Whyte, that if the trial judge or the sentencing judge there had determined that the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his own conduct, a full-time custodial sentence could not be avoided.
	
	
	It does not follow that simply because the Court there determined as it did that the driver in that case had not abandoned responsibility for her own conduct that a sentence full-time custodial sentence was inevitably to be avoided. There is nothing in the guideline judgment that suggests that be the case. Simply because an offence is not aggravated by the presence of certain factors, it is not necessarily mitigated by the absence of those factors.
	
	
	Here I have spent considerable time considering the alternatives to full‑time imprisonment. For example, whether a significant fine or a bond or a suspended sentence or an intensive correction order or indeed, as foreshadowed by Mr Thangaraj SC in the course of his detailed submissions, a home detention order or any such sentencing option would be appropriate. I have reviewed those options against the background of the facts and the offender’s personal circumstances. In all the circumstances, none of those options would adequately reflect the requirements of general deterrence. In particular, the circumstances of the driving involved, the consequences of the driving, are such that an alternative to full time custody would not address the dangerousness of the offender’s driving in the context of his driving or his past criminal history, nor indeed the fact that he has been extended lenient sentencing options in the past
	


Special circumstances


	
	There is a proper opportunity for some consideration here to be extended to the offender. He is aged 28. He comes from a supportive family. He has attained a relatively high level of education and employment. He is a person of some initiative but, balanced against that, he has prior convictions and a not unproblematic traffic record.
	
	
	Given the supportive and nurturing upbringing he has had, the offender is likely to find his first time in custody to be difficult. However, while there is medical evidence as to his anxiety, which is also apparent during the sentencing proceedings, there is nothing to indicate that imprisonment will be more onerous on him than for any other offender.
	
	
	I have read the Pre-Sentence Report and taken those matters into account. It does seem appropriate to reduce the statutory ratio of the overall sentence with a non-parole period there as to the total head sentence to one of two-thirds, from that of three-quarters which would normally be the case.
	


Accumulation, concurrence and totality


	
	I turn then and finally to the question of the accumulation, concurrence and totality of the sentence to be imposed given that there are seven charges. They each arise out of the same incident with the same factors of criminality of the driving being relevant to all seven victims. Nevertheless there are seven distinct victims each of whom has suffered in his or her own way.
	
	
	The criminality involved in driving into a group of seven drivers is greater than for a driving offence involving a single cyclist or a single victim in these circumstances. It needs, and is appropriate therefore, that there be some marking of the fact that there are seven different victims by way of a period of partial accumulation in relation to the sentence.
	
	
	This is a difficult matter when I come to consider the impact of totality and what is commonly sometimes referred to as the Pearce principles – Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. In my view that period of partial accumulation should be of a relatively minor nature. It should be order of two months non-parole period of imprisonment in relation to each of the four separate counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	It is also appropriate that each of the actual bodily harm charges should be served wholly concurrently with each other and with the sentences on the grievous bodily harm counts. That is not meant in any way to minimise the fact that each of the seven victims have been separately, differently and in some cases, permanently affected. That period of partial accumulation reflects, and is intended to mark, the fact as I say that there are separate counts with separate victims and the impact of the offence on each of them.
	
	
	The discount for the plea, and the associated remorse, as well as the value of that plea to the facilitation of the criminal justice, including the fact that the victims did not have to give evidence, should be reflected in a discount of 25%. That would effectively mean a discount of nine months’ imprisonment to the sentence otherwise to be served.
	


Indicative sentences


	
	I propose in this case to impose an aggregate sentence. Absent the plea I would have considered all the matters that I have outlined above to warrant the imposition of a sentence of three years imprisonment. To that figure the discount should apply resulting in a total sentence of two years and three months by way of a head sentence.
	
	
	Applying the finding of special circumstances to the total sentence so set out that would result in a non‑parole period of imprisonment of 18 months and that is what I propose to impose. Before I proceed to do that, are there any matters, Ms MacDougall that you wish to raise?
	
	
	MACDOUGAL: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Are there any matters, Mr Crown?
	
	
	HUGHES: No, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you for that courtesy.
	
	
	On each of the grievous bodily harm counts, the sentence will be one of 21 months imprisonment to be served by way of a sentence of non-parole imprisonment of 14 months with an additional term of seven months.
	
	
	On each of the three counts of causing bodily harm by misconduct, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of nine months’ imprisonment, each such term to be highly accumulated with the sentence on count 1.
	
	
	Each of those sentences on the grievous bodily harm counts will be subject to a period of partial accumulation of two months.
	


Proposed sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. The formal orders I propose are:
	


1   The offender is convicted.

2   Taking into account a finding of special circumstances, and a plea of guilty, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the offender is sentenced to a period of full-time imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing today and expiring on 20 February 2017.

3   The balance term is of nine months expiring on 20 December 2017. So the total term is 27 months but it is actually a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment, you understand that.

I would ask that you be aware, Mr Kerr, that after the conclusion of these remarks I will be asking the Corrective Services who are present in the back of the Court to take you but I want you to use this opportunity to make your final comments to your family privately in the courtroom

SHORT ADJOURNMENT

HIS HONOUR: I’ve given the parties an outline.

The paragraph on the indicative sentence is simply that in relation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 the head sentence is one of 21 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 months. On counts 5, 6 and 7 is a fixed term of nine months’ imprisonment.

So Ms MacDougal you might like to approach Mr Kerr to make sure he understand the actual sentence and he can read it there. I’ll go through that now. Did you see the heading there, sentence, Mr Kerr?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: If you could stand I’ll impose that now.

OFFENDER: Sorry.

Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. The formal orders are - and these are the dates that become relevant.
	


1   The offender is convicted.

2   I take account a finding of special circumstances and a plea of guilty the offender is sentenced to a period of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing today and expiring on 20 February 2017, you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.


	
	The balance terms of nine months expiring on 20 December 2017. That will be the period of on parole, do you understand that? So the total term is 27 months but it is actually 18 months imprisonment, you understand that.
	


OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.


	
	HIS HONOUR: I recommend your release to parole on 20 February 2017.
	
	
	Parole will be subject to the following conditions. That you comply with whatever supervision is deemed necessary by Community Corrections and that you would need to inform them of any change of address in which you are living and any change of address not less than seven days before that change occurs, you understand that?
	


It may be that they will require separate matters in relation to driving and it is likely to be the case that the RTA will be writing to you separately but that is a matter that is not before me at the moment.

Mr Crown, what do you want to do about the s 166 certificate.

HUGHES: Your Honour, I’d invite the Court to dismiss that matter. The negligent driving matter.

HIS HONOUR: I will dismiss the count set out on the sequence set out in the section 166 certificate.

Presumably you’ve got no opposition to that, Ms MacDougal?

MACDOUGAL: No.

HUGHES: Your Honour, there remains a matter of disqualification. I don’t mean to interrupt your Honour’s remarks but so I don’t forget.

Lest I forget to mention it in the absence of an order of the Court there were be a three year disqualification period applicable, minimum 12 months, disqualified from holding a licence. That would need to be from today.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. In my the disqualification period should be one of two years which would cover the - two years, yes, two years from today. Do you wish to be heard against that?

HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you. Nothing else, Mr Crown? Nothing else, Ms MacDougal?

MACDOUGAL: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I just indicate that this Courtroom will now be used for other sentencing proceedings. I’ve arranged with the judge presiding in that and I will vacate by 10.30 which I will do. But perhaps I would urge that the victims in the matter might like to vacate the Court first so that there’s no opportunity for tension because I want to ensure that happens generally so I’d be grateful for that.

Perhaps if the family and supporters would remain where they are just for a little while until that happens, thank you.

2702902,Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222,"___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN J: I agree with Garling J and also with the additional observations of R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J for the reasons his Honour has provided.
	
	
	I wish to emphasise my agreement with what his Honour has written in relation to the lack of utility of relying upon sentencing statistics in a case such as this.
	
	
	One of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant illustrates a major premise underlying the case he presented in this Court:
	


""A review of the relevant judicial statistics, which although not determinative can act as a guide, demonstrate that the applicant's sentence is greater than the majority of cases dealing with a plea of guilty for multiple offences pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)."" (AWS [27])


	
	The Court was provided with statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales of sentences imposed in the ""higher courts"" for the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of amphetamines in less than the commercial quantity. The above submission is based upon a selection of the variables ""multiple offences"" and ""plea of guilty"".
	
	
	Selection of the variable ""plea of guilty"" does not refine the statistics in any useful way; there are 123 cases presently in the database for sentences imposed for this offence out of which pleas of guilty were entered in 120.
	
	
	Selection of the variable ""multiple offences"" is of no real utility in this context either. It does not confine the database to multiple instances of the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of amphetamines in less than the commercial quantity. The ""multiple offences"" variable simply selects cases in which an offender was sentenced for a particular offence as well as one or more offences of any type. Comparing a case such as the present where a person was sentenced for four counts of drug supply with cases which might involve one drug supply offence and other possibly unrelated offences not necessarily of the same level of seriousness is of no utility.
	
	
	Then there is the problem identified by Garling J that the Judicial Commission does not maintain statistics for overall or aggregate sentences imposed in multiple offence sentencing exercises. The statistics only relate to what is identified as the ""principal offence"" in any sentencing exercise. Available on the opening page of the statistics section of the Judicial Commission's website is a hyperlink to a document: ""Explaining the Statistics"". It contains an explanation of the counting methods employed and the variables that may be selected to refine the statistics. The explanation includes the following:
	


""The principal offence

The statistics are appearance (or person) based and only the 'principal offence' for each finalised matter is used. All secondary offences are excluded from the data. Past data reveals that in just over half of cases the offender has only one proven offence. This constitutes the 'principal offence' for the purposes of the statistics.

Where two or more charges are proved against a person, the offence with the most severe penalty is selected as the principal offence. If two or more charges attract the same sentence, the offence which carries the highest maximum penalty is selected as the principal offence. If two or more offences have the same statutory maximum penalty and the same sentence, the offence with a Form 1 attached (see further below) is selected.

Where there are a number of different cases (or Court files) which are dealt with by a single judge for sentencing, these are counted as a single case. A principal offence is selected using the above rules from all the offences dealt with by the Court.""


	
	The substance of this explanation of the basis upon which the statistics are compiled was set out in Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71 at [47].
	
	
	The applicant also provided the Court with statistics with selection of the variables ""one offence only"" and ""plea of guilty"". Thus the Court was invited to compare cases in which persons were sentenced for a single offence of drug supply with the present case where the offences could not be regarded as isolated instances of supply but properly regarded as being part of a course of conduct.
	
	
	Another error in the applicant's argument was that it included a comparison of the non-parole period for his aggregate sentence with statistics for non-parole periods. That involved a comparison of the aggregate non-parole period for four offences with non-parole periods imposed for single offences and for the principal offence in multiple offence sentencing exercises where all of the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. The non-parole period of a principal offence where there is some degree of accumulation of sentences is not counted at all. (See in ""Explaining the Statistics"" under the headings ""Consecutive sentences"" and ""Concurrent sentences"".)
	
	
	Misunderstanding as to what the sentencing statistics illustrate, and do not illustrate, are not uncommon. They have been the subject of comment from time to time in Criminal Law News, LexisNexis Butterworths: see, for example, 18(5) Crim LN [2905]; 20(7) Crim LN [3242]; and 21(9) Crim LN [3434].
	
	
	The limits upon reliance upon sentencing statistics in support of arguments about the severity of sentences generally have been the subject of repeated comment in this Court: see, for example, the very useful summary in Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225 at [19] (Bellew J, Macfarlan JA and Fullerton J agreeing). But if they are to be relied upon, it is necessary that counsel ensure that the limits of their utility are properly understood.
	
	
	GARLING J: On 22 June 2015, Mr Brian Knight, the applicant, filed a Notice of Application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court (Robison DCJ) on 22 September 2014.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty before Robison DCJ to four offences contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 (“Trafficking Act”). The four offences all consisted of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine. The offences occurred respectively in each of April, May, June and July 2013.
	
	
	On the first three occasions, namely in April, May and June, the applicant received 14gms of methylamphetamine from a supplier, which he then sold in smaller amounts in the Bourke area. On the fourth occasion, the applicant had in his possession a little under 10gms of methylamphetamine. The cumulative amount was 51.73gms of the drug.
	
	
	An offence against s 25(1) of the Trafficking Act carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. There is no standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	On 22 September 2014, the applicant received an aggregate sentence which consisted of a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 22 September 2014 and expiring on 21 June 2016, with a balance of term of 1 year and 7 months commencing on 22 June 2016 and expiring on 21 January 2018.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence also included a further offence contrary to s 36Y(1)(a) of the Trafficking Act, namely an owner or occupier knowingly allowing his premises to be used as a drug premises which was put before the Court on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The applicant only relied upon one ground of appeal, namely that his sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Facts


	
	A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below.
	
	
	In December 2012, the police commenced an investigation into allegations of the supply of methylamphetamine and other illicit drugs from Sydney to western NSW and in particular, the Bourke region. During the course of that investigation, police identified an individual who lived at St Marys, who was using the applicant Mr Knight, who lived in Bourke, to transport illicit drugs between Sydney and Bourke and sell them on his behalf.
	
	
	The operations of the applicant and his supplier were electronically and physically monitored.
	
	
	The first offence occurred on 24 April 2013, when the applicant met his drug supplier in Dubbo. He was given a package containing 14gms of methylamphetamine. The applicant took the drug to the Bourke township and sold the drug in small quantities. For his role in this part of the dealing, the applicant received 3.5gms of methylamphetamine which he sold to make a profit for himself.
	
	
	The second offence occurred on 12 May 2013. On this occasion, the applicant met with his drug supplier in Narromine. The applicant was supplied with 14gms of methylamphetamine. At the time he was accompanied by a young 15 year old male juvenile and his adult brother. The applicant concealed the drugs and then drove with his brother and the 15 year old male juvenile to Dubbo to collect his brother’s car. Whilst there, he purchased numerous, small, re-sealable bags to facilitate the sale of the methylamphetamine. The applicant paid the 15 year old to return to Bourke with his brother, collecting the drugs from their hiding place on the way. The applicant again received 3.5gms of methylamphetamine as his reward for participating in this drug transaction and which he sold at a profit.
	
	
	The third offence occurred on 8 June 2013, when the applicant came to Sydney from Bourke to watch a rugby league match. He met with his drug supplier and obtained a further 14gms of methylamphetamine. The applicant returned to Bourke with the drugs and sold them. For his role in this enterprise, the applicant received 3.5gms of methylamphetamine which he sold to make a profit for himself.
	
	
	The fourth count occurred on 16 July 2013, when the applicant again travelled to Sydney to watch a rugby league game. He brought the 15 year old male juvenile with him. He also brought a grandson and a nephew aged 7 and 10 respectively. Before returning to Bourke, the applicant contacted his drug supplier and made arrangements to collect 14gms of methylamphetamine. The exchange occurred at a shopping centre in Penrith. The applicant, the 15 year old, and his young family members went to a nearby park where the parcel containing the drugs was handed by the applicant to the juvenile, who concealed the parcel of drugs inside his underwear.
	
	
	As the applicant was returning by motor vehicle to Bourke on that evening, he was stopped by police in the Blue Mountains area. The 15 year old was searched and found to be hiding the parcel of drugs in his underwear. The applicant was arrested.
	
	
	Upon his arrest the applicant told the police that the drugs belonged to him and he had asked the 15 year old to courier the drugs to Bourke to reduce their chance of detection by police. Upon analysis, there was found to be 9.73gms of illicit drugs.
	
	
	The offence placed on a Certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act alleged that between April and July 2013, the applicant resided at specified premises in Bourke. It was alleged that at those premises during those times, he knowingly allowed, and was involved in, the unlawful supply of prohibited drugs from the premises (“the s 166 offence”).
	
	
	Upon his arrest on 16 July 2013, the applicant was taken to the Penrith Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview. During the course of the interview, the applicant admitted to each of the offences, and was remorseful about committing them, telling the investigating police that he was pleased that he had gotten caught and knew that what he was doing was silly.
	
	
	The applicant told the police he became involved in the offences because he was unable to get work, and needed income to support himself and his family.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the four offences and as well the s 166 offence, on 6 March 2014, at the Bourke Local Court. He maintained those pleas when brought before the District Court.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	The applicant ultimately came before the District Court on 22 September 2014. He was indicted, and he pleaded guilty to the four counts on the indictment. He also agreed that he was guilty of the charge that was placed on the s 166 Certificate.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report dated 24 March 2014, was tendered by the Crown. A number of documents were tendered on behalf of the applicant, who gave evidence himself before the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The applicant, a mature Aboriginal man, in his evidence told the Court that he came from a large family. He was the youngest of 15 children. He told the Court that he had engaged in the transaction because of his financial difficulties through being unemployed. He said that he had been stupid to engage in the crime, particularly getting his young cousin involved, and he felt that he had let his family and his community down with his conduct.
	
	
	He outlined what he had been doing in an attempt to make good his offending conduct by getting involved in a number of community projects. He said in effect that he had taken significant steps towards his rehabilitation.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he agreed that he understood the danger which illicit drugs could cause in the community, and that he had engaged in the conduct notwithstanding that he had seen those effects. He told the Court that he had made between $5,000 and $6,000 out of his illicit drug transactions which he had dealt with by spending it on clothing, fuel, food and ordinary bills, for himself and his family.
	
	
	A Mr Stephen James Howarth gave evidence. He was a project officer with the Department of Education, Communities and Aboriginal Affairs. Mr Howarth is the applicant’s nephew.
	
	
	He gave evidence of what his uncle, the applicant, had been doing since his arrest. He said that there had been a substantial change in his life, and in his attitude towards the community and particularly his family. He also noted that the applicant had engaged extensively in caring for his elderly mother, and also other members of his family.
	
	
	In particular, he gave evidence of a very recent approach to the applicant by the principal of the High School to assist in the role as a teacher’s aide with a number of young indigenous adolescents in Years 9 to 12, who were students at the local high school.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report tendered by the Crown noted that the applicant had the fulltime care of his year old grandson, and played an active role as a grandfather to his other grandchildren. It noted that the applicant left high school at about 15 years of age, and from that time had casual employment in a variety of occupations.
	
	
	The applicant told the Community Corrections Officer that he had experienced episodes of depression and anxiety, but no psychiatric report was tendered.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Officer considered that the applicant would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections, and the implementation of various case management strategies, including referral for assessment and ongoing counselling with a visiting psychologist, referral to a relevant local job network agency, ongoing interview and contact with Community Corrections, and referral to TAFE and community agencies for financial counselling and ongoing budget analysis and financial management.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Officer assessed the applicant as being suitable for a Community Service Order under s 86(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (“Sentencing Procedure Act”).
	
	
	The first of the documents tendered in the applicant’s case consisted of a letter which he himself wrote to the Court for the purposes of the sentencing. In that letter, he expressed his shame at his conduct, and noted that he had had a period of about 12 months to reflect upon the inappropriateness of it.
	
	
	He also described to the sentencing Judge his activities which he voluntarily commenced after he was charged, which he was doing to benefit the community. This involved making headstones for the graves of many people who had not had headstones erected. The headstones which he provided were done for free, at his own cost. Many of the people who received them did not have the financial capacity to pay for a professionally made headstone. Their expressions of gratitude were also noted.
	
	
	He also noted that he had undertaken a course at TAFE, including helping young indigenous people living in Bourke to undertake the same course that he was doing. He assisted with the course and working with the young indigenous people.
	
	
	He also described how he had been filling in as a teacher’s aide at the approach of the Principal of the High School. He had been recommended for that job by a police officer in Bourke, who was responsible for the Police Citizens Youth Club.
	
	
	The applicant described how he saw his new role as being a leader in his community, and that it represented a significant change in his life.
	
	
	There were also a series of character references which spoke highly of the applicant, and in particular his work in providing of headstones for graves of people who could not afford them. As well as the references from individuals who all spoke highly of the applicant, the Court was provided with a document relating to a variety of penalties imposed for people convicted of similar or analogous offences.
	
	
	In submissions to the sentencing Judge, the applicant’s counsel accepted that whilst the applicant was suitable for an intensive correction order, it would be unlikely to be open to the Court at that time to impose such an order because, as he conceded, the overall length of imprisonment would need to be more than 2 years. The applicant’s counsel also conceded that a suspended sentence, under s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act was not appropriate.
	
	
	What the applicant’s counsel sought was to have the applicant further remanded for a period of about 1 year so that the Court could have a real sense of his rehabilitation. The applicant’s solicitor submitted that such an approach was permissible under s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel concluded with the submission that a sentence in the vicinity of 2½ years as a total term, and somewhere between 12 and 18 months as a non-parole period, was appropriate.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the nature of the offence and the total quantity of drugs, which was about ten times the indictable quantity, the particular community to which the drugs were supplied and that children were in the vicinity of the drug supply and the involvement of the applicant’s 15 year old nephew, as all being matters of aggravation. The Crown also pointed to the fact that the drug supply took place out of financial motivation and that that was ordinarily regard by courts as being a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the applicant’s past criminal history, which included convictions in the Bourke District Court of supplying cannabis at higher than the indictable quantity but less than the commercial quantity. For one offence the applicant was imprisoned with a non-parole period of 7 months commencing 10 April 2008 with an additional term of 4 months and 22 days. For another offence of supplying a prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity, which was not cannabis, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on the same date.
	
	
	The applicant’s other offences, whilst relatively regular, were not relevant for the sentence in these matters.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	His Honour commenced by identifying the offences with which the applicant was charged, and to which he had pleaded guilty. He identified the evidence that was put before him, including the agreed set of facts. He summarised those facts.
	
	
	His Honour acknowledged the applicant’s criminal history and indicated that he was persuaded that the case before him was one which indicated a very high level of remorse and contrition on the part of the applicant “… which is neither feigned nor is it expedient. It is real and that is amply underscored by his full and frank admissions to the police”.
	
	
	His Honour noted the extent of the financial gain to the applicant, which he described as “not an insignificant sum”.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to the applicant’s subjective case and circumstances, the references which were tendered, and newspaper reports which were put before him recounting what the applicant had done in the community since his arrest. His Honour indicated that he accepted the evidence of the applicant unreservedly.
	
	
	His Honour specifically referred to the lengthy period of time for which the applicant had been on bail (about 15 months) during which time he had reported to police every day and had not re-offended.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge acknowledged that the applicant should receive a 25% discount for his plea of guilty. He referred to the fact that general deterrence, rather than specific deterrence, in this case meant that a full-time custodial sentence was not only appropriate, but was inevitable. He rejected submissions that he should deal with the applicant by way of a remand under s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that there was virtually no risk of the applicant reoffending and that specific deterrence did not loom large in the particular case. His Honour made a finding that special circumstances was appropriate, particularly by way of allowing the applicant to continue his good work in the community.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the principle of totality and considered that it was appropriate to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	He said that with respect to each offence by way of indicative sentence, he would have imposed a sentence of 1 year and 9 months. With respect to the s 166 offence his Honour indicated a sentence of 3 months.
	
	
	Having reviewed all of these matters, his Honour then in an evaluative determination by way of an aggregate sentence, imposed a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months from 22 September 2014 to 21 June 2016. He imposed a balance of term of 1 year and 7 months to expire on 21 January 2018. His Honour noted that the total sentence was 3 years and 4 months.
	


Was the Sentence Manifestly Excessive?


	
	On this application, counsel for the applicant submitted that the aggregate sentence of 3 years and 4 months in total, with a non-parole period of 21 months, fell outside the permissible range of sentences when considering the particular facts and circumstances of the applicant, and the nature of the offences themselves.
	
	
	Counsel did not submit that there was any identifiable error of fact, or identifiable misapplication of legal principles. Rather, counsel sought to argue that the sentence itself was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58].
	
	
	The submissions pointed to the fact that the quantity of the drug was a relevant factor, and that the quantity involved in each offence, namely 14gms or less, was an amount towards the very lowest end of the range for an indictable quantity.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant’s role was that of a street dealer and, accordingly, that he was the person most likely to be detected and arrested by police. She submitted that the applicant occupied a role at the bottom end of any hierarchy of drug dealing.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant pointed to the indicative sentences and submitted that an indicative sentence of 21 months for a single offence of supplying 14gms of methylamphetamine was “alarmingly high” for a street dealer, who had a very strong subjective case.
	
	
	Counsel drew attention to statistics from the database maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales which noted that 70% of offenders who pleaded guilty to a single offence under s 25(1) of the Trafficking Act, did not receive a full-time term of imprisonment, and 85% of those who were sentenced to jail, received a head sentence of 24 months or less.
	
	
	By reference to the Judicial Commission statistics for offenders charged with multiple offences, counsel submitted that this applicant had received both a non-parole period and a total period of imprisonment which was in the top one third of all offenders.
	
	
	Ultimately, counsel for the applicant submitted that, having regard to the very strong subjective case put forward by the applicant, this Court should infer that the sentencing Judge failed to properly exercise his discretion and that this Court should conclude that there must have been an error even though it was impossible to identify: see Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58].
	
	
	Counsel concluded her submissions in this way:
	


“Section 3A of the Act mandates the purpose for which a court imposes the sentence, one basis being to promote the rehabilitation of an offender. Likewise, specific deterrence and the protection of the community are key objectives. Yet his Honour found that the applicant was virtually at no risk of re-offending, therefore specific deterrence did not loom large and consequentially the protection of the community has been met through the applicant’s self-initiated rehabilitation. When one adds into the equation the considerable remorse, in addition to that which is reflected through full and frank admissions and an early plea of guilty, a sentence placing this offender in the top one third of the sentencing range is manifestly excessive.”

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the offences merited the sentence which was imposed. The Crown pointed to the fact that the applicant engaged in the offences for the purpose of deriving profit and that he conceded that he had made a significant sum of money - $5,000 to $6,000 – from the transactions over the space of about three months.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown submitted that the offences were aggravated in respect of Counts 2 and 4 by the applicant’s use of the 15 year old male juvenile, and by the presence of the two other young family members during Count 4. The Crown pointed to the fact that the applicant’s lengthy criminal record did not entitle him to any particular leniency, and that it was necessary to keep in mind that the maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment applied to each count on the indictment.
	
	
	It pointed to the repetition of offences across a period of time as indicating that the criminality of the applicant was serious.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no reason to conclude that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Discernment


	
	The sentence imposed by Robison DCJ reflected a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s early plea of guilty.
	
	
	His Honour did not make a clear finding about the objective seriousness of each of the offences. He said that he needed to be mindful of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. He remarked upon the adverse effect of illicit drugs in the community. He also found that such was the “level of offending”, and the level of moral culpability of the applicant, that the matter was not appropriate for an order under s 11 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	The offences were deliberate. They were engaged in for the purpose of financial reward. There is no suggestion that the applicant was motivated by greed. Rather, he used the money to provide for his family. The offences required a degree of pre-planning and organisation. The applicant involved a 15 year old male juvenile in two of the offences, and gave him a significant part to play. As well, one of the offences took place in the presence of other young children.
	
	
	The distribution, even at street level, of illicit drugs in a community such as Bourke is an offence which has a significant impact on the community, which means that general deterrence is an important consideration.
	
	
	There was a strong subjective case. His Honour made findings most favourable to the applicant with respect to those matters. But the applicant was not entitled leniency, particularly, having regard to his past record which included two terms of imprisonment for dealing in drugs.
	
	
	Resort to the statistics relied upon by the applicant should not result in undue weight being given to them. This Court has said so on many occasions. The reason one cannot give great weight to sentencing statistics is “… the vast range of factors relevant to sentencing for such an offence”: Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 362 at [74] per R A Hulme J. The important question here is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate for the particular case: Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90 at [41] per Hoeben J.
	
	
	The statistics referred to demonstrate that the indicative sentences in each case fall at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for a single offence against s 25(1) of the Trafficking Act. But that is not the question which this Court needs to determine. Indicative sentences are just that. They are not sentences against which any appeal is determined. They are one way in which a court is assisted to understand how the aggregate sentence is reached. Ultimately, the question about a sentence is whether it falls within the range of permissible exercise of a sentencing Judge’s discretion: Fogg v R [2011] NSWCCA 1 at [59]-[60].
	
	
	The submissions of counsel for the applicant in this case made by reference to statistics contained an inherent flaw. The statistics to which reference was made were not at all comparable with the sentencing exercise of the Judge here. At present, the Judicial Commission of NSW does not maintain any statistics which record and collate aggregate sentences which have been imposed. Thus, there is, at present, no ready or available guide which charts the length of aggregate sentences, whether of themselves, or together with indicative sentences.
	
	
	In my view, in this case, the use of comparative statistics is not a rewarding process. Like is not being compared with like. I agree with the remarks of R A Hulme J in his judgment about the basis of the statistics provided and the need for counsel, if they are to assist the Court, to properly understand the statistics, the basis upon which they are compiled and the limits which constrain their use according to authority.
	
	
	The applicant was a mature man. His previous convictions and terms of imprisonment for dealing in illicit drugs did not specifically deter him from engaging in this particular conduct. The motivation was clearly financial, and the conduct extended over some months. It was deliberate and planned.
	
	
	General deterrence, particularly in a small community such as Bourke, of people who engage in knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug carries with it particular significance.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the matters which were appropriate to be taken into account, and which his Honour obviously did take into account, whilst I would accept that the sentencing in this case was not a lenient one, I am wholly unpersuaded that it was manifestly excessive. It was a sentence which was, both in respect of the non-parole period and the total term, one which was clearly open to the sentencing Judge. It was not unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	I do not think that the appeal should be allowed.

2702916,R v KOSITZIN [2015] NSWDC 303,"Judgment – Application for stay

Introduction


	
	HIS HONOUR: Nicholas Kositzin (the ‘applicant’) has moved for a permanent stay of proceedings and other related orders, if needs be, in respect of the proposed prosecution of him by the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to alleged sexual assaults said to be committed upon the complainant between January 1982 and July 1983, according to the most current indictment at ""Akuna Bay"", in other environs of the Hawkesbury River and at or near Mona Vale. The motion of the accused also seeks access to documents sought to be produced on subpoena if the application for a permanent stay of proceedings is unsuccessful. The applicant for a permanent stay of proceedings is opposed by the prosecution. The issue of the accused's access to subpoenaed documents has not yet been resolved having been put aside until the application for a permanent stay of proceedings is resolved.
	
	
	The matter with which I am concerned came before me on Friday 19 June 2015. It is apparently a matter that had been in the list for some time. On 19 June 2015 the matter had been specifically listed before myself having previously being mentioned with a view to endeavouring to resolve the issues to be litigated. Unfortunately, 19 June 2015 was the last date I was sitting in Sydney for a period of seven weeks. The next week I was to go to Queensland for a conference conducted by the National Judicial College of Australia in respect of the Judicial Orientation Program for which I am on the Steering Committee. Thus, I was out of Sydney for a week for that. Then I was overseas for three weeks and then I have sat in Wagga for three weeks in a busy sittings. This was the first week I was back in Sydney. Thus, I listed the matter this morning at 9.30 with a view to delivering this judgment. I apologise to the parties for the delay but as they understood clearly on 19 June it was not possible for me to give judgment that day.
	


The evidence


	
	The prosecution had previously filed an indictment containing 20 counts alleging various sexual assaults from indecent assaults to carnal knowledge of a stepdaughter to buggery committed by the accused. However, a further indictment is proposed to be filed reducing the number of counts to be prosecuted to 13 over the same period of time; that is, from 1 January 1982 until late July 1983.
	
	
	A number of affidavits have been filed on behalf of the accused to which I will refer in a moment. Primarily amongst them is an affidavit from the accused's solicitor in support of the motion which produces or exhibits a great deal of material germane to the trial and also the application. Amongst those items exhibited annexed to that affidavit are the original indictment, copies of court attendance notices, a document described as a ""Fact Sheet (sic)"" setting out the history of the matter and a number of details in relation to the specific allegations alleged by the complainant, a history of the circumstances of alleged disclosures by the complainant and then also statements obtained in the course of the police investigation that have been produced to the defence, a report from a psychologist, Dr Garry Banks, two reports from a neurologist and a number of documents produced from general practitioners that have treated the accused over a period of time.
	
	
	The accused was born, as I understand it, in March 1946 and is now 69 years of age. The complainant was born in August 1969. Her mother, who is still in a relationship with the accused, commenced a relationship with the accused in or about 1981. The alleged sexual assaults occur when the complainant was either 12 or 13 years of age. Between the beginning of January 1982 and late July 1983, the complainant, the accused and the complainant's mother from time to time lived on a boat that was moored in Akuna Bay in the vicinity of the Hawkesbury River.
	
	
	The evidence available to this Court, of course untested but arising from the material that has been exhibited, either by the accused's solicitor in the annexures to her affidavit or other material, reveals that the complainant made general allegations of sexual assault against the accused to a friend and also it is said her family in about July 1983. That friend has provided a statement to police in respect of specific complaints allegedly made to her by the complainant. That statement is from 2010. That witness is KK.
	
	
	As a result of the complainant making particular complaints to Ms K's family, the Mona Vale Police were contacted and the complainant was spoken to by police, as I understand it, on 29 July 1983. There was no further investigation after that date as the police investigation, for reasons set out in an occurrence pad entry dated 29 July 1983 attached to the statement of Mr Banfield, who was formerly a Sergeant Of Police, discloses. After speaking to the police, it would appear the complainant was for a period of time returned to the custody of her mother and I take it the accused. However, some weeks later she was placed in foster care.
	
	
	It is also alleged from the material available to me that the complainant made another complaint of being sexually assaulted to a person who referred the matter to the high school she then attended. It would appear that it is alleged she spoke to a counsellor at the high school. Ultimately, for reasons that I need not dwell upon, they are a little unclear from the material available to me, this caused what has been described in the papers as the Department of Community Affairs (sic) to become involved. The involvement of the Department ultimately led to the complainant being moved to the foster care of a family of which the parents have provided statements for the purposes of the current proceedings. As I understand the matter the father of that family was a Minister of Religion. The complainant lived with this family for approximately two years.
	
	
	Subsequent to the end of foster care the complainant kept in some contact with her mother over the years. She alleges, amongst other things, a family meeting in July 2009 in the presence of her then husband, who is now deceased, at which the accused and her mother attended. It is alleged by the complainant and by the complainant's late husband that the accused made a general admission to the complainant of wrongdoing.
	
	
	The complainant made a statement to police which commenced to be taken in late 2009 and was completed, as I understand it, in February 2010. That is a statement that apparently was taken over some months. However, the police first approached the accused in relation to the current matters in October 2013. He was subsequently, after he exercised his right to silence, served with what were described as ""future"" court attendance notices on 26 October 2013; in other words, he was apparently not placed under arrest but was contacted by the police and served with the details of specific allegations on 26 October 2013.
	
	
	Part of the background of this matter of some importance is that the accused had been involved in a motor vehicle accident variously described in the material that I have received as occurring in either 1968 or 1969, although the preponderant date seems to be 1968, and since that time he has had a number of significant disabilities, limitations and restrictions as well as health complications arising from that motor vehicle accident. Quoting from the report of Dr Banks, who quotes from material provided by Associate Professor Crimmins the neurologist to whom I earlier referred, the applicant suffered ""major damage to the right side of his brain with a large parieto occipital infarct or brain death"". He suffered ""significant speech disturbance"" due to the accident. He has a ""right sided weakness involving his arm, face, leg and he suffers from epilepsy"". He has other conditions, perhaps from other causes, either directly or indirectly relating to that motor vehicle accident, including obstructive sleep apnoea, polycythaemia, Crohn's colitis, or Crohn's disease, as well as a history of previous alcohol abuse.
	
	
	One of the general practitioners who has also summarised Mr Kositzin's conditions reflects upon elevated blood pressure, vascular disease, pleural thickening on chest X-ray and diabetes. He has had other health complaints affecting his health, including thromboses, ulcers and has had a number of medical interventions, including a balloon coronary angioplasty. His epilepsy causes him to have seizures, the frequency of which is not fully disclosed, and those seizures have immediate impact upon his presentation. Those seizures would increase as his alcohol consumption increased according to the report prepared by Dr Banks. He has a range of medications to treat a range of conditions, including Dilantin, Lipitor amongst other drugs including drugs providing pain relief.
	
	
	I have referred to the fact that the assessment of Dr Banks is annexed to the solicitor's affidavit in support of the motion. That report is dated 13 April 2015. I have two short reports from the consultant neurologist dated 21 January 2015 and 11 February 2015. I have produced to me various ‘patient summaries’ and other records of medications prescribed and the like from a practice known, as I understand it, ""GPs Practice"". I also have what is said to be a current ‘treatment plan’ setting out the treatments required of the accused.
	
	
	I have the statement of the complainant, as I have earlier said, that was completed in early 2010, although it is dated late 2009. I have statements from her foster parents (the Higginbothams) statements of the complainant's husband, who is obviously now not available, correspondence between the accused and the solicitor acting in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and as well as that copies of subpoenas sought to be issued on behalf of the accused related to the secondary application.
	
	
	The accused has also sworn an affidavit adopting the detail of medical reports tendered, setting out some particulars as to his own disabilities, setting out some information provided to him about the availability or not of relevant records, witnesses and other information concerning the allegations. These matters relate to matters such as absent records for the mooring of the boat on which the accused lived at relevant times, the unavailability of school records, the unavailability of his employment records and the like.
	
	
	The accused's solicitor has sought in part to summarise some of the evidence contained within the reports that she has exhibited with her affidavit, including seeking to summarise some of the clinical presentations of the accused to Dr Banks and others. The solicitor for the accused has also sworn a further affidavit setting out difficulties in relation to her inability to locate particular records said to be of relevance to the character and detail of the allegations made by the complainant. She also swears as to the inability to be able to locate people that have been referred to by the complainant in statements she has made as having provided her with various treatment, as well as matters relating to the unavailability of a witness.
	
	
	In response to the accused's motion the prosecution tendered a bundle of documents, including material I would assume that is within the prosecution brief, perhaps obtained after the initial service of the brief, and which has been served on the accused. Included in these documents is the proposed indictment setting out what I understand to be the current allegations to be brought against the accused; that is, the 13 counts to which I earlier referred. A transcript and a recording of a legally recorded listening device used to record a conversation between the complainant, her husband, the accused and the complainant's mother on 20 December 2012.
	
	
	I point out I have listened to the recording of that conversation and I have read the transcript. There is a statement from the officer-in-charge relating to his involvement in the investigation between 2010 and 2013 which is dated December 2013 and a further statement from him dated May 2015 to explain the delay in investigating the matter between 2010 and 2013.
	
	
	A further statement has been obtained also from the complainant dated May 2015, in which she deals with allegations she makes against the accused and whether or not they arose from recovered memory, as it has been described, which she denies. Also providing details of her contact with some form of ""clairvoyant"" or ""medium"" and a ""psychiatrist"" and other counselling. There is in the Crown’s bundle a statement from her school friend concerning complaints made to her by the complainant allegedly in 1983 and there is a statement from the former police officer, Graham Banfield who, by reference to the occurrence pad entry which is exhibited with his statement, was involved in the interview of the complainant in July 1983. That occurrence pad entry deals with the allegations as they were recorded in general terms, the partial or complete retraction of those allegations, details of conversations with the accused and with the complainant's mother and other matters. I will return to this and the other material when I consider the merits of the application.
	


The principles


	
	There seems to be little disagreement between the parties as to the fundamental principles to be applied, and that is to be expected given the settled state of the law. Both the Crown and the defence, that is the applicant and the respondent, have sought to summarise those principles that pertain to an application for a permanent stay of proceedings. Particular reference was made by the accused to the decision of R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173 specifically to parts of the judgment of Hodgson JA and particularly the judgment of Adams J who provided the primary judgment of the Court, relying specifically upon not only his summary of the general principles, but also matters that he raised in his judgment dealing with the case at bar.
	
	
	Reliance was also had upon the dicta in the decision of Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541 particularly, as I understand it, at 551. Of course, that authority is a leading authority in relation to dealing with issues that arise in respect of applications for an extension of time for the commencement of civil proceedings where there is a statutory limitation period. If I might just at this point quote from part of the judgment, which I understand is relied upon, the judgment of McHugh J particularly where he says at 551:
	


""The enactment of time limitations has been driven by the general perception that 'where there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates'. Sometimes the deterioration in quality is palpable, as in the case where a crucial witness is dead or an important document has been destroyed but sometimes, perhaps more often than we realise, the deterioration in quality is not recognisable even by the parties. Prejudice may exist without the parties or anybody else realising that it exists. As the United States Supreme Court pointed out in Barker v Wingo , 'what has been forgotten can rarely be shown', so it must often happen that important, perhaps decisive, evidence has disappeared without anybody now 'knowing' that it ever existed.""


	
	There are other comments made and I appreciate those observations are seen in the context of different circumstances, but I would prepared to accept McHugh's general proposition as to the difficulties that arise where it is demonstrated that witnesses are no longer available or time has elapsed such as to affect the reliability of the memory of particular people.
	
	
	The Crown in its written submissions took the Court in particular detail to the fundamental principles as they have developed over the years, particularly since the mid 1980s and the decisions of the High Court, specifically at [57]-[64] of the Crown's submissions. The author of those submissions was a different Prosecutor to the one that appeared before me. As I said, the principles in general terms are scarcely in doubt, although some of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to by both the applicant and the Crown add some texture or substance to the fundamental principles, as I might describe them, clearly laid down by the High Court.
	
	
	Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 is authority for the proposition agreed between the parties that the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings should be exercised only in ""exceptional cases"".
	
	
	In Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 395-396 the High Court held that the question of whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed as an abuse of process falls to be determined by weighing a variety of factors and considerations, including requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and the conviction of those guilty of crime and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.
	
	
	In R v Glennan (1992) 173 CLR 592, particularly at 605-6, per Mason CJ and Toohey J, it was held that in order to justify an order for a permanent stay of proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial which is of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do can relieve against unfair consequences. This observation in Glennan was a reflection upon observations made earlier by the High Court in Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 and, of course, again in Jago v District Court of New South Wales to which I have referred.
	
	
	In the more recent judgment of The Queen v Edwards [2009] HCA 20, the High Court, referring to Walton v Gardiner noted that the Court was required to consider:
	


""Whether in all the circumstances the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness or whether the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process.""


	
	Bellew J in the more recent judgment of TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174 said at [63]-[64]:
	


""The categories of circumstances which may justify an order granting a stay of criminal proceedings are not closed, nor are they capable of exhaustive definition. However, it must be recognised that a stay of a criminal trial is an extreme remedy which will be reserved for the most exceptional cases. The onus remains upon an applicant for an order for a stay to establish a factual basis for the order which is brought. That onus is necessarily a heavy one.""


	
	Leeming J in this judgment at [1] noted:
	


""The Court must be satisfied that the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness or would be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process.""


	
	In this particular matter, of course, there are a number of factors said to be on the part of the applicant contributing to the injustice or the potential injustice which is claimed in the context of the authorities I have quoted justifying a permanent stay of proceedings. In The Queen v Edwards, to which I earlier referred, the Court said at [31]:
	


""Trials involve the reconstruction of events and it happens on occasions when relevant material is not available. Documents, recordings and other things may be lost or destroyed. Witnesses may die. The fact that a tribunal of fact is called upon to determine issues of fact upon less than all the material which could relevantly bear upon the matter does not make the trial unfair.""


	
	I might for my own measure add the word ""necessarily"" before the word ""unfair"". In Jago it was held by Mason CJ (at 33) that:
	


""In the safeguarding of the interests of the accused...the touchstone in every case is fairness.""


	
	In R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133 Bell J, then of the Supreme Court, said at [65] that:
	


""Delay in this case has been very great indeed. However, commensurate delays, even greater delays, have not in themselves been held to be a sufficient basis for a court refusing to exercise jurisdiction.""


	
	Later she said at [68]:
	


""In determining whether by reason of delay a point has been reached such that any trial would necessarily be unfair, the Court looks to evidence of actual prejudice in the conduct of the defence. That evidence is considered in the light of the powers of the trial judge to relieve against such unfairness. These powers include giving appropriate directions, including warnings to the jury, ruling as to the admission of evidence and control of the procedures of the Court generally. The majority in Jago accepted that it will not always be possible for the trial judge to protect an accused against an unfair trial by these mechanisms.""


	
	In the decision of Littler, to which I made earlier reference, which was a case concerned with a number of factors arising out of delay in the prosecution in circumstances where the accused was charged with a number of sexual assaults allegedly occurring between the mid 1950s and the early 1960s, Adams J said at [25]:
	


""In cases of this kind where allegations are made and charges brought after such a lengthy delay, the investigating police have a duty, in my view, to search out contemporaneous witnesses who might be able to shed light on the relevant circumstances. It is not appropriate to leave this investigation to the defence or, of course, to the complainants. Although in a sense, therefore, it is for the applicant to establish such prejudice as would justify a stay of proceedings, this should be in the context of a full and adequate investigation by the prosecuting authorities which provides a context that enables the Court to evaluate in a sensible way the extent of the prejudice affecting the accused. In light of the material tendered in the District Court in this case it is impossible to avoid the conclusion either that little more has been done than the reduction of the complainant's allegations to a statement in the conventional form or there are no witnesses now available and able to provide relevant and significant evidence.""


	
	In that judgment in the following paras [27]-[35] his Honour dealt with many of the fundamental principles to which I have referred and also dealt with what were then the principles relating to appropriate warnings to be given in delayed complaint cases following upon the judgment of Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 and the decision of Crampton v The Queen (2000) HCA 60. Those two judgments are concerned with warnings that were held to be appropriate in cases of considerable delays, such as the case with which I am now concerned. But, of course, those matters have to be seen in the context of legislative amendments, particularly the provisions at ss 165A and 165B Evidence Act 1995. His Honour in that judgment also reflected upon an aspect of the matter of particularity that arises from the evidence in this case. He cited R v Adler, an unreported judgment from 1992 of then Gleeson CJ, with whom other members of the Court agreed :
	


""The fact that a witness who is potentially able to corroborate an accused is for one reason or another, such as death disappearance or disability, unavailable at trial does not normally produce the result that the accused cannot obtain a fair trial.""


	
	Adams J went on to point out, however:
	


""It is important to note...that even so, his Honour went on to consider the possible significance of the evidence potentially available from the missing witness upon the assumption, clearly enough, that this factor may have been such, in the particular circumstances of the case, to take out of the 'normal' category. The question has been considered in other cases citing a number of unreported judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as Goldberg, McCarthy and Hemling from 1993 and 1994.""


	
	Adams J at [37] cited the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tolmie, an unreported judgment of 7 December 1995. His Honour said:
	


""An assessment was made of the possible significance of the evidence said to be unavailable in Tolmie. As Hunt CJ at CL pointed out, it was not possible to assess the prejudice that the accused might have suffered as a result of the missing evidence since nothing was known of what evidence, if any, two unavailable witnesses would have given.""


	
	He contrasted this with another case from 2000 of Stringer. I pause for a moment to point out that there is no suggestion of a missing witness that could be said to ""corroborate"" or specifically ""support"" the accused in his denial of the allegations brought by the complainant. That has not been demonstrated in any way by any of the material presented to me. Furthermore, some of the matters that are adverted to relating to missing records and the like do not assist the court as to what, if anything, any missing person or document might provide by way of evidence relevant to the issues in the case.
	
	
	So far as the issue of missing witnesses and evidence is concerned, the Crown cites a decision of McCarthy, to which I have earlier referred, from 1994 where Gleeson CJ remarked:
	


""Time and again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die or become ill or lose their memory or lose documents. If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal list in this state. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need be stayed.""


	
	I appreciate there may be an element of irony in what his Honour said, but the ultimate point he made has been validated in a number of judgments concerned with claims of missing witnesses and the like.
	
	
	In relation to the matter of Littler, in the context of understanding that it is rely upon both as to principle and by reference to the circumstances of the case, Adams J referred to in that case, in the context of the ""great delay"" which is far greater than here, three instances of what was said to be the prejudice otherwise described as ""three main classes"". The first concerned the unavailability of numerous, I emphasis the word ""numerous"", potential witnesses who are dead, demented or are unable to be identified [24]. His Honour referred to the second significant matter of prejudice as concerning the effective delay on the applicant's ability to remember with reasonable reliability what he said were the ""contextual facts of the alleged occurrence"" [38]. I pause for a moment to point out, as has been pointed out in the course of submission, that one of the issues that arose in the matter of Littler was the reasonableness of the claim that the accused would have a justifiable reason for not being able to remember particular students that he taught at relevant times surrounding the allegations brought against him. The third factor, as he described it in his judgment in Littler, was the that which arose out of the ""psychological, psychiatric and medical examinations of the applicant"". In that matter it was said to be of ""considerable significance in determining whether the Court below made a relevant error in declining to grant a stay"". I need not go into the detail of that material, but it represent s a cognitive disability or disabilities on the part of that applicant far greater than claimed in relation to the accused with which I am concerned.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicant’s written submissions, and some of the oral submissions, sought to distil the various factors arising from the evidence relevant to the application. I appreciate, of course, that the application of the accused is not one solely concerned with one issue, for example great delay, standing alone. Here the suggestion of missing witnesses and the like, the physical and mental condition of the accused and related issues are very much intimately bound up with the other factors. It is pointed out in the defence submissions, to deal with them directly, that the alleged sexual assaults occurred, as per the timing of the written submissions, ""between 32 and 33 years ago"". The allegations brought against the accused provide no specific dates, rather a range of dates, and lack an absence of detail as to the events giving rise to particular sexual assaults.
	
	
	It is pointed out that the applicant is a man in his late 60s and is a person of very poor health. The medical condition of the applicant, which I have summarised, is further particularised from particularly the reports of Associate Professor Crimmins. The applicant has had, as I have pointed out, angioplasty, both in 2009 and 2010 and he is described as being on a ""cocktail of medications"". He suffers speech disturbance. It is claimed he has ""an inability to totally comprehend the spoken word"". His ability to give a coherent history is grossly impaired by language disturbance. He has an inability to take in information in a complex manner. He will have difficulty following the course of proceedings. He will have difficulty understanding fully what is happening. He will have difficulty understanding the substantial effect of any evidence given against him because of the complexity of the way it will be presented. He will have difficulty in giving counsel proper instructions in a timely manner. He will have difficulty in taking any information that is presented to him and then being able to communicate any comments in relation to that.
	
	
	That last sequence of matters I have identified come purportedly from a report prepared by Associate Professor Crimmins. I point out in relation to the matter that the matter I am concerned with is not an application for the accused to be found unfit to be tried and, as I understand it as the matter was argued before me, no real issue of fitness to be tried arises. If it did, one might have thought that was a matter that properly ought to have been addressed before any application for a permanent stay of proceedings arose.
	
	
	Although I accept on my reading of Associate Professor Crimmins’ report that he would seek to address matters which would be concerned with the so-called ""Presser"" criteria, his analysis of that matter is not supported by Dr Banks.
	
	
	With regard to Dr Banks' report, largely based upon the context of the interviews and ""clinical presentation"", a variety of matters are referred to: the length of time it took for him to be assessed; his hesitations in responding to particular matters raised with him; his mobility and capacity; his obesity; his difficulties in communicating; the laborious character of his speech; the characteristics of him seeking to ""gap fill"" between words with what are called ""vocal utterances""; pauses, exasperation; the character of his responses; his acquiescence to propositions put to him; circumstances, as I understand it, as ""gratuitous congruence""; the time it took him to process information; his fatigue and other matters.
	
	
	It is acknowledged, however, in the written submissions dealing with Dr Banks, a matter I will deal with in my consideration of the matter, that his actual conclusions are, to quote the learned counsel for the applicant, ""in many respects out of kilter"" with the clinical observations. It is put on behalf of the applicant that it is particularly concerning how a jury will perceive the accused if he engages in lengthy delays between answering questions, if he stutters, as he would almost certainly do, if his speech was laboured and the like.
	
	
	In relation to this aspect of the matter in the affidavit of the learned solicitor for the applicant sworn 23 April 2015, she in great particularity at [13] goes through a number of the observations made by Dr Banks. I do not propose to quote them, but I have taken all of the various matters that she has identified from paras 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 33, 34, 37, 40, 42, 43, 49, 50, 51 and 52 of his report. They, without being ironic or critical, are in the spirit of the various matters that are summarised in the submissions of learned counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	In relation to the accused other matters are raised in the submissions arising from Dr Banks examination such as the accused's potential for exasperation or even anger at himself given his frustration at being able to deal with questions.
	
	
	Reference is made in the submissions, as I have pointed out, from a very brief summary of the evidence to inquiries made to find records relating to, for example, the mooring arrangement at the marina, the location of other boats nearby, which cannot be located. There has been change to the mooring area in Akuna Bay since events are alleged to have occurred 32 years ago. People that worked in various capacities in that area can no longer be located.
	
	
	According to the statement of Detective Lombardo, the officer-in-charge, from December 2013 no records could be found identifying locations that are generally described by the complainant in her statement. He refers to the death of the complainant's husband, which I have already referred to, the unavailability of Gabrielle Higginbotham, a childhood friend of the complainant who apparently died in 2007 well before the complainant brought the detail of her allegations forward in 2009. Of course, some of the matters identified in the submissions have been overtaken by subsequent events such as, for example, the claim that there was no statement from former Sergeant Banfield, the author of the occurrence pad entry to which I have referred. This case has the feature of ‘delayed complaint’ and no scientific evidence available to support the complainant's account. I note that the accused's employment records are unable to be located. Whether he was at work at a particular day or not is not able to be established, but, again, the difficulty for the accused, I understand, will be the difficulty of pointing to a particular day given the generality of the complainant's allegations.
	
	
	Reference is made to the statement of the complainant in May 2015 to particular people, a psychiatrist and some form of counsellor. No records can be found relating to the psychiatrist who is named. A counsellor that is named by the complainant has been identified. No statement has been served in relation to that. There is alleged in the submissions a quality of ""flashback"" and ""psychiatric treatment"" infecting the memory of the complainant and also some complaint made about the character of the covert recording to which I made earlier reference.
	
	
	I might say in passing in relation to the covert recording that it is a neutral matter in proof of guilt. Certainly by itself, or in conjunction with all the other matters that have been raised, it is not a matter that provides any justification for the granting of a permanent stay of proceedings. The issue of its admissibility, whether the Crown wishes to rely upon it, and other matters such as what weight would be given to it, in due course are all matters well within the province of the trial judge and do not, in my view, bearing in mind the recording that was made in 2012, reflect upon the capacity of the accused to obtain a fair trial arising out of matters germane to the application for a permanent stay of proceedings.
	
	
	I note that the reliance upon Adams J's observations in Littler by the applicant at [47]-[49], where his Honour reflected upon the inability of the then applicant to give evidence coherently and fluently without ""substantial hesitation and qualification"", to be able to remember evidence, difficulties with short term memory and the like.
	
	
	As his Honour pointed out in that judgment quoted by learned counsel for the applicant, that the varies problems in Littler were ""not merely cumulative but ... (multiplied) the significance of others"". Reference is also made by the applicant's counsel to the High Court judgment of Kesavaragah (1994) 181 CLR 231, of course a leading case in relation to the test for fitness to be tried. In that judgment, as it is cited in the written submissions, it was said (at 246):
	


""It makes no sense to determine the question of fitness to be tried by reference to the accused's condition immediately prior to the commencement of the trial without having regard to what the accused's condition will or is likely to be during the course of the trial. There is simply no point in embarking on a lengthy trial with all the expense and inconvenience to jurors that it may entail, if it is to be interrupted by reason of some manifestation or exacerbation of a debilitating condition which can affect the accused's fitness to be tried.""


	
	I have seen no evidence, even though I appreciate there is some deterioration over time in the accused's condition, that this trial would involve such a length of time as to either contribute to the deterioration of the accused or for any deterioration during the course of the trial to be a significant factor. I say in passing I cannot see the trial taking longer than four weeks, subject to any delays that might be required to accommodate the personal circumstances of the accused, a matter I will deal with in a moment.
	
	
	Oral submissions were made by counsel for the accused. They reflected upon matters within the written submissions, reflecting again upon both substantial delay and the effect of that delay upon the character of the investigation. Again, reference was made to the unavailability of witnesses or ""lost witnesses"", such as GH the complainant’s ‘foster sister’, the complainant's husband, the unavailability or impossibility of identifying people related to the mooring arrangements at Akuna and related matters.
	
	
	In the context of the medical and psychological evidence it was submitted by the applicant that although the accused had been suffering the various physical impediments he now suffers from substantially, at the time of the alleged offences, his condition had worsened since that time and I accept that is so. His problems are both physical and cognitive, referring to the report of Dr Banks and the neurologist. But it was accepted in oral submissions that there was conflict between Dr Banks' assessment of the clinical presentation and some history received and ultimately the findings he made. Reference is made also to the fact that Mr Banfield does not have any real memory of the circumstances of the preparation of the occurrence pad, which is not unexpected.
	
	
	It is submitted that the accused's disabilities would not permit are him to do justice to himself and that the case was far more complex than conceded by the prosecution. Particularly it is also pointed out that there was an ""inexcusable delay"" between the making of the statement by the complainant or the completion of it and the matter being brought to the attention of the accused.
	
	
	The Crown's written submissions sought to focus upon what it identified as the issues raised by the applicant, both in the context of the legal principles to be applied and the evidence available to the Court as well as the character of the litigation. The categories that the Crown identifies, which are generally accurate although there may be matters of degree and detail that could be quibbled with, include the health of the accused, the character of the allegations brought by the complainant such as the absence of corroboration or supportive evidence, the missing statement from Mr Banfield, matters pertaining to the foster family, the death of relevant people, particularly the complainant's husband who provided a statement in 2009, the history given by the complainant in her statement of having used prohibited drugs, having seen a clairvoyant, the significance or relevance of the listen device recording, the absence of an explanation for the delay in charging, if that is the correct expression, the applicant after receiving the complaint.
	
	
	With regard to the health of the applicant the Crown does not dispute ""that the accused suffers and has suffered for varying times from a number of health issues"". However, it is claimed by the Crown there is ""no evidence"" that the accused cannot be fairly tried by reason of his medical conditions. His submissions deal with the issue of Dr Crimmins' view of the matter. The point is made by the Crown that if the accused has difficulty understanding complex instructions, the character of the case and the response of the accused that might reasonably be expected, given the generality of the allegations and the length of time since the relevant events, is not one that requires ""complex instructions"".
	
	
	The evidence is not complex. Various criticisms were made of Dr Crimmins' report and, in any event, it is pointed out from Dr Banks' report that his assessments occurred over seven and a half hours in two sittings which the accused was able to participate in, four and a half hours on one occasion, three hours on the other. The observations of the applicant by Dr Banks and the conclusions of Dr Banks are particularised at various paragraphs of the submissions contrary to some of the assertions and conclusions pressed by the applicant. It is submitted by the Crown in various ways, set out at [20] - [21] of the Crown's submissions, that there are various mechanisms that could be undertaken to accommodate the incapacities and difficulties of the accused, which would not make his trial unfair, and ultimately, based upon Dr Banks' assessment of the matter, there is no reason for the accused to be seen as disadvantaged by the conduct of the trial in that way.
	
	
	As to the absence of supporting evidence it is put that this is not a matter required as a matter of proof. The issue of absence of supporting evidence would be expected in respect of offences not committed in public or in the presence of another person. The Crown does refer to what it calls ""timely complaint"" of a sexual offending in 1983. Unfortunately, the Crown will have to accept in due course the fact that the complaints are general. There is also a retraction of them and other matters that may reflect adversely upon the credibility of the complainant. In any event, the issue of ""complaint"", if that is the way it is to be described may be a matter relevant to the assessment of the credibility of the complainant.
	
	
	With regard to Detective Banfield, as I said, that matter is taken care of, it is said by the Crown, by the statement he has prepared. In any event, the occurrence pad speaks for itself. In the context of the detail of the occurrence pad, the Crown points to the statement of Ms King from 2010 which details specifics of complaint, if I can use that word again, made by the complainant. With regard to the death of the husband, it is pointed out that notice has been given to the defence pursuant to s 67 Evidence Act 1995. The issue of the admissibility of that evidence and what directions would be given in respect of that evidence contained within the statement if it was admitted is a matter for the trial judge and not an uncommon occurrence given the operation of the Evidence Act (cf s 65 Evidence Act).
	
	
	So far as the complainant's background of drug use, seeing clairvoyants, seeing psychiatrists and the like, it is submitted by the Crown that the complainant has given a full disclosure. The complainant denies any reconstructed memory and the allegations contained within the most recent detail of her allegations against the accused, that is, the statement completed in February 2010, can be regarded as ""a confirmation"" of complaints she made in 1983. Whether that is true or not, again, is a matter for comment in the trial. The Crown may have some difficulties in terms of the credibility of the complainant given the absence of detail in 1983. Be that as it may, the Crown says that the complainant is available for examination in relation to those matters. I say in passing, by reference to that, that a number of the matters that the complainant discloses may well be matters to be taken up on behalf of the accused reflecting upon her credibility. That is a matter for trial counsel.
	
	
	So far as the listening device recording is concerned, there are certain comments made by the Crown. They do not seem to really touch upon, nor do the submissions of the accused touch upon, issues germane to whether there should be a permanent stay of proceedings. There is conceded to be a delay between the matter being reported to police and the charging of the accused. However, Detective Lombardo has prepared a further statement in relation to that matter.
	
	
	The Crown completed its submissions by saying that the assessment of this application would be guided by consideration of the observations of Bell J in RWO [2002] NSWCCA 113 [89]. Her Honour said:
	


""To my mind the evidence does not establish that the applicant's memory difficulties are such to (make a trial) in respect of events that occurred so many years ago would be unfair. In Littler Adams J noted that the loss of recall of unremarkable 'contextual fact' may be a source of real difficulty to the conduct of the accused's defence. The applicant in that case was a member of staff of the Westmead Boys’ Home at the relevant time. The allegations were made by former students. As Adams J observed the interval of time made it difficult for the applicant (assuming him not to have committed the offences) to recall the complainants and what, if any, contact he had with them. The present case does not seem to me to give rise to quite the same considerations. This is not to say that the applicant's memory of the incidents of domestic life is not likely to have been impaired by the passage of well over 30 years. A direction in the terms set out in Longman and Crampton acknowledges the difficulty that an accused faces in seeking to meet allegations brought many years after the event.""


	
	I must say in relation to that last aspect of the matter, of course, although the Crown does not refer to it, there are the issues that arise by the operation of s 165B Evidence Act. Bell J in that judgment referred to the issue of delay being not uncommon in ""child sexual offences"". She noted for reasons that there may be delays in complaint which will need to be the subject of specific direction having regard to s 294 Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	So far as the post complaint delay in the investigation, it is submitted by the Crown that those matters are addressed by Detective Lombardo. The Crown said in its written submissions that such a delay was ""not desirable"" given the nature of the inquiry, but other investigative demands had pressed upon Detective Lombardo and no particular prejudice has been identified flowing from this particular period.
	
	
	The prosecution in its oral submissions asked the Court to have regard to the recording of the conversation made in December 2012 and submitted that when one hears the recording it demonstrates in an unguarded moment that whilst the accused had some speech impediment he was well capable of understanding questions put to him and responding to those matters, although it was conceded he had some difficulty in expressing himself. I for myself would agree with that general proposition.
	
	
	It was also pointed out that he has been able to instruct his counsel, as his affidavit evidence in this matter showed. It was submitted that any physical and cognitive difficulties could be accommodated in a range of ways, both by the operation of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act, such as s 42, arrangement being made about the conduct of the proceedings, appropriate directions to the jury, even the pursuit, of a trial by judge alone, although the Crown was not necessarily encouraging that approach.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the Crown case was not complex. Matters raised by the defence about the absence of corroboration, as it was expressed, were matters of no moment given the character of the allegations, and there was the evidence, again in this context, although it seems to me mistakenly in this context, to the complaint as it is described in 1983 both to the police and to Ms King and her family.
	
	
	Counsel for the Crown on the basis identified by Bell J sought to distinguish the matter from Littler. Here the accused was faced with one complainant, who the accused knew well. Of course, Littler involved a person facing historical allegations from a number of complainants, as Adams J pointed out, that he had good reason not to know well.
	


Consideration


	
	It has taken some time to work my way through both the histories to be addressed and the bases upon which it is sought that I should address those issues. However, it is important that the significant matters raised by the parties be identified in the judgment. As I said earlier, the essence of the application by the accused is that a combination of factors combined to render the prospective trial of the accused unfair and it is submitted on behalf of the accused that there are no means for remedying the situation by direction or any other method. With this general submission I cannot agree.
	
	
	At the heart of that general submission two particular matters dominate. Obviously, the current health of the accused and the extensive delay in bringing the prosecution forward, both in the disclosure of detail by the complainant to police and then the delay in the matters being brought to the attention of the accused to which I have referred. There are other matters, of course, to be seen in conjunction with these primary matters such as unavailable witnesses, lost evidence, inability to make relevant inquiry to challenge the claims of the complainant and other issues pertinent to the health of the accused that would affect his capacity to participate in the trial.
	
	
	I have noted many of the particular matters raised by the applicant's counsel in his submissions which purportedly arise from the assessment of the accused by Dr Banks and by Associate Professor Crimmins. With regard to some of these issues examined individually, appreciating the global effect of the submission made by counsel for the accused, general issues relating to ""forensic disadvantage"" arising from relevant delays and bringing forward the allegations of the complainant in detail these are matters for comment at trial. Although, as I said, there was no delay as such in terms of general complaint by the complainant about sexual impropriety by the accused. This is a matter that, notwithstanding s 165B Evidence Act can appropriately be dealt with either by general or specific directions at the trial by the trial judge.
	
	
	I accept, of course, that in the absence of particular detail concerning time of relevant events, people present and the like, the accused's position may be reduced to the character of a general denial, which is one of the matters raised on his behalf. However, the case would be an appropriate one, in my view, for the relevant direction to be given to the jury concerning the issue of forensic disadvantage on application of the accused's counsel notwithstanding the terms of the Evidence Act. It seems to me if such a direction was sought it could not be resisted either by the Crown or by the trial judge.
	
	
	The particular disadvantages which are identified in the evidence and from submission are the very matters, in my view, that would be specifically identified as examples of relevant forensic disadvantage which would require the jury to very carefully scrutinise the evidence of the complainant in conjunction with other matters. The prosecution of historical allegations with sexual assault are not uncommon in this and other courts, but by operation of the Evidence Act, in conjunction with what remains of the common law directions, the superior courts have accepted that in the appropriate case warnings will be required to be given. The Bench Book currently available to judicial officers confirms that in very clear terms.
	
	
	My personal experience, of course, not conclusive in determining this application, is that as recently as two weeks ago I presided over a trial in Wagga Wagga of a man alleged to have committed sexual assaults against the complainant when she was aged between the ages of five and eight years, the allegations being over 38 years old; in other words, a woman in her late 40s was endeavouring to remember events she said occurred when she was between the age of five and eight committed upon her by a neighbour. The accused was left in no other position than making a general denial. He did not give evidence in his trial. Yet he was acquitted.
	
	
	I appreciate, of course, that each trial is different. However, that situation illustrates both the effectiveness of the appropriate warning and the respect with which it is given by juries. In any event, it is common ground within the law, following upon some observations are made, for example by McHugh J when he was a Judge of the High Court, that the operation of the law, particularly in the area of criminal trials, proceeds on the assumption that jurors will comply with their oaths or affirmations to return true verdicts in accordance in accordance with the evidence and follow the directions of the trial judge and obey the directions the trial judge gives.
	
	
	There is ample authority for the proposition that the sequelae of delay in prosecution as arises in this matter, the death of witnesses, the difficulties in locating or inability to locate relevant witnesses, the loss of evidence and the like, are features of the problems that occur by delayed disclosure and they can be dealt with by direction which are either of themselves or in combination with other factors in the appropriate case matters which will not create exceptional circumstances in order that a permanent stay of proceedings be given.
	
	
	The particular matters pointed to by the defence such as the inability to locate witnesses and records, the deaths of witnesses that are known about etc to my mind do not relate to matters at the heart of the truth of the allegations made by the complainant given the character of the allegations and the location and circumstances of the alleged offending. This observation includes the contents of the statement provided by the husband of the complainant. His statement gives some historical account of the complaints made to him by the complainant and also gives accounts of things that are said to have occurred in the presence of the accused and the presence of the complainant. These matters are not matters that go to the heart of the truth of the allegations. They are very of dependent upon the reliability of the complainant herself.
	
	
	In that regard, I turn now to the health of the accused. His limitations physically and in his speech and other matters that are identified in the submissions of the applicant and in the evidence produced on his behalf are self-evident. In my view, however, as significant as they are, they are not so profound in the context of the analysis of them by, for example, Dr Banks so as to render any proposed trial materially unfair.
	
	
	I bear in mind in relation to the matter that whilst I accept over time, of course, with ageing and the character of the conditions he suffers, there will be a worsening or deterioration in the condition, or there has been. For example, since the period of time when the offences were committed but the fundamental difficulties and disabilities to which reference has been made in the material has, as I have understood the evidence, largely been present for quite a number of years before the offences were committed. It has not been put. Nor is there evidence to support the proposition that the accused by reason of his physical impediments and purported cognitive limitations summarised in the submissions to which I have referred and contained within the material tender render him unfit to be tried.
	
	
	Whilst the evidence of his solicitor and some of the submissions point to aspects of his clinical presentation, an analysis of the findings of relevant experts, that is, Dr Banks and Associate Professor Crimmins suggest those matters do not support a proposition that the disabilities of the accused are so profound as to prevent a fair trial. As was expressly acknowledged in the oral submissions and in the written submissions, the ultimate findings of Dr Banks sit somewhat at odds with some of the clinical observations that have been extracted and detailed, for example, by the accused's solicitor.
	
	
	Dr Banks noted in his report, admittedly I accept, addressing the issue of fitness to be tried, that the accused ""demonstrated an intact understanding of court and the allegations made against him"". His orientation to person, time, space and purpose is intact, as is his awareness of the current events, including the then pending Commonwealth election. His autobiographical memory is sufficient for the purpose of being able to comment on actions that took place some years ago. As was noted with his awareness of past Prime Ministers, there is potentially a “confounding” element associated with his traumatic brain injury which he sustained in 1968. Provided he is given adequate support and time he is able to formulate a response to charges so that his lawyer can cross-examine the prosecution witness. The applicant is considered fit to give instructions to his solicitor but these instructions will be likely in the form of simple statements. The applicant was able to attend and focus in his interview for four and a half hours on 19 March 2015 and for a period of three hours on 25 March 2015.
	
	
	During a trial (the applicant) may experience some difficulties recalling information presented in the course of the proceedings and may need occasional reminders throughout the trial when he may need additional time to process information presented to him. But none of these elements would be sufficient concern to render him unable to competently participate in the hearing in any substantive way. The burden may actually be on the listener who will need to exercise considerable patience to enable (the applicant) to find his voice and words.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out that those very matters could quite easily be properly addressed by the trial judge in a manner that would cause absolutely no prejudice to the accused. One might have thought in the circumstances of the matter, even though the jury will be given a warning about sympathy and the like, such matters might excite some sympathy on the part of the jury.
	
	
	In the context of the applicant's presentation to court, suitable arrangements can be made to ensure if required to give evidence, that the burden of giving evidence and the manner and the presentation of his evidence is undertaken in a way that will not cause him injustice. The matters raised by the prosecution concerning the complexity or lack of complexity of matters requiring instruction, in my view, are valid. There will be a filter that operates between the accused and his solicitor to assist in digesting information or communicating instructions.
	
	
	The accused has had ample time before trial to give proper instructions. In fact there is no claim about it being impossible for him to give instructions. The accused has been able to swear an affidavit in relation to relevant matters. In any event, special arrangements can be made if needs be for him to either give instructions or to receive advice in the course of the trial.
	
	
	Associate Professor Crimmins' reflections upon the accused's capacity to understand the gravity of the charge and understand the Court processes are reflected upon his awareness to the character of the charges. He identified significant speech disturbance and other significant matters of communication which are particularised in the submission.
	
	
	He said in his report on 11 February 2015 that the:
	


--""immediate recall, memory of events and ability to give a coherent history was grossly impaired by his language disturbance...the content (of what he said) was still appropriate in the context of what he was being asked...this was determined during a number of consultations I have had with him over the years, but especially during the most recent consultation. At that time I saw him for a period of 45 minutes. We discussed the Court case and its implications and, in my mind, there was no doubt he was clear of the implications of the Court case and his not guilty plea.""


	
	One of the reasons that it would be clear, one would have thought, is simply because of the lack of complexity of the character of the case brought against him so far as the allegations were concerned.
	
	
	I appreciate in swearing an affidavit in this matter there would have been considerable difficulty for the applicant articulating the detail of the evidence, but the affidavit itself shows a coherent understanding of matters relevant to this application and the litigation. As I said, the various matters identified by way of physical or, perhaps, cognitive difficulty, although I perceive no significant cognitive difficulty on the part of the applicant, are all matters that can be managed by the trial judge or the legal representatives of the accused in consultation with the prosecution and the trial judge. The trial judge will have to be alerted to any special arrangements that are required, such as the seating of the accused, suitable breaks, explanations to the jury and the like, as well as appropriate warnings.
	
	
	As it stands it could be argued by the prosecution given what I understand to be the accused's condition in 1982/83 that that condition, as I said earlier, was substantially as it is now. Allowing for some deterioration with time. The Crown would argue that even in those circumstances it is not inappropriate for the accused, if he on the Crown case committed the alleged offences, to seek to avoid facing trial in relation to the matter on the basis of essentially the same disabilities that he had, in fact, at the time of the commission of those offences. That is the Crown case.
	
	
	On the other hand, as raised in submission to me and a matter specifically referred to by Associate Professor Crimmins, there appears to me to be a live issue as to whether the accused was, in fact, physically capable of doing some of the things that are alleged against him in the circumstances of the complainant being restrained in the manner in which he claims. These are all matters for a jury to determine with appropriate directions.
	
	
	There are other matters to be identified and dealt with on this application. Although it was not a matter expanded upon by the defence in oral submission, it would appear that some of the matters specifically addressed in the defence written submissions, as I have said earlier and as the Crown has contended, have been addressed somewhat belatedly by additional material produced by the Crown. I refer to the statement of Sergeant Banfield. That bundle of material I have been provided does include a number of additional statements which, apparently, have been obtained in late April or May of this year, including, as I said, the additional statement from the complainant.
	
	
	I deal with the issue of delay from early 2010 when the complainant's statement was finalised to October 2013. Detective Lombardo attempts to address that in his most recent statement. I regret to say I find his explanations are weak, in some respects non-existent, concerning the issue of unforgivable delay. A number of complaints are made about the matter in terms of objective comment are accurate and the Crown hardly shies away from it when one analyses the submissions. I appreciate the delay in the investigation in this matter is not necessarily an indictment of Sergeant Lombardo. He gives explanations of being torn away from this investigation to undertake other work of the New South Wales Police Force, that I can understand.
	
	
	However, it seems to me that whatever he has done or not done, there stands to be proper criticism to be made of the policies of the New South Wales Police Force in cases of this type. This is one of many cases of its type where many, many months, sometimes years, pass after a complainant has raised historical allegations of sexual assault in a generally coherent narrative account, before any proper investigation is undertaken. Usually the first phase of the investigation, although not in every case I hasten to say, is a perfunctory investigation before the allegations are put to or brought to the attention of the alleged perpetrator. The pattern in all those matters is the same as it is here.
	
	
	Whatever the suspect says or does not say when spoken to by police, he or she is usually immediately charged or else served with court attendance notices without much, or any further ado. Later on, of course, after he has been charged there is a realisation by someone that there are various issues needed to be addressed, either because of the initial statement of the complainant itself, because of subsequent statements by her or other witnesses, because of matters raised by an accused in an interview or because of matters raised by the defence legal representatives in the preparation of the case.
	
	
	Then there is a flurry of investigation into matters before the trial or some pre-trial litigation. We often see in these cases matters involving complaints that are years old, statements still being prepared in the week before or the week of the start of a particular trial. These further investigations can be contaminated by further delay or the earlier conduct of the investigations. Only a fool would think, in circumstances where witnesses should not discuss matters amongst themselves, that if a complainant has made a statement three or four years before then, just before the trial a close family member is called upon to make a statement to assist to confirm an aspect of her or his account, there is no risk of contamination between those two potential witnesses. In any event, eventually statements are obtained and inquiries which are made which really should have been obtained before the accused was charged or even before a decision was made to interview him.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind that when an accused person is interviewed in relation to matters of historical sexual assault generally in that interview process they are expected to respond to general allegations put to them without any meaningful opportunity of reflecting upon what is alleged with usually very few particulars about place and time. Usually in circumstances where the questioner has had the relevant statement in his or her possession for months, sometimes years before. In historical sexual assault matters the accused when interviewed is called upon to respond in detail to matters that are many, many years old where nobody, save for someone of particular mental acuity, would be capable of remembering with precision the details that relate to the contextual issue of those allegations.
	
	
	The case in Wagga Wagga was a case in point. One of the issues that arose in that case was whether the accused was actually a neighbour of the complainant or whether he moved into the house after the complainant had moved address. The case I am referring to involving the 38 year old allegations had evidence that at one point that the victim or the alleged victim's neighbours were the parents in-law of the accused. It was suggested as part of the Crown case that the accused had lived in the house with his parents in-law. There was evidence in the case to show that, in fact, after the victim and her family moved out of the house, the parents in-law moved into their house and then the accused and his wife and his children moved into the house next door of the parents-in-law although they had been regular attendees at the next-door premises when the victim had lived in the subject premises.
	
	
	That is all well and good, but the point of the matter was that when the interview was conducted with the accused and he was asked by the police to remember where he lived in Wagga during the 1960s and the early 70s, he not only reflected some uncertainty but he named some places where he had lived, but did not name other places that documentation from the Land Titles Office established that he had lived. He did not remember living in two addresses where there were records of the Land Titles Office to demonstrate that he lived at particular times. This shows the difficulty for a person in that situation to be able to remember details which turn out to be entirely accurate. In these circumstances, of course, it is small wonder that many such accused are acquitted in circumstances where, if proper investigations have been undertaken, either the accused would never have been charged or, alternatively, the Crown might have had a stronger case than the one that is ultimately produced at trial.
	
	
	In this matter it seems to me the only material evidence now compromised or unavailable is the potential evidence of the complainant's late husband and the particular representations alleged to have been made by her and also alleged representations of the accused in her presence and his presence. The other matter of unavailable evidence and the like reflects upon witnesses which, who I said earlier, were not only not germane to the truth of the allegations, but about which in most instances no guarantee could be had as to what they would have said even if they were available.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of the missing husband, the admissibility of that statement or the contents of that statement will need to be considered having regard to s 65 and 67 Evidence Act, perhaps also by consideration of s 137 of the Act, assuming the Crown would wish to tender the document given the warnings that inevitably would be required about it, if sought by counsel for the accused. Pursuant, for example, to s 165 Evidence Act or for other reasons. As it transpired, it seems to me that the delay between 2010 and 2013 would have made no difference to the availability of that witness given his death shortly after 2012.
	
	
	Ultimately, the delay in the investigation of the matter is not a material matter in this case save for the fact that it has added already to the existing substantial delay from 1983 until 2010 before substantial and detailed disclosure by the complainant in her first statement. I have taken that matter into account, but I particularly take it into account the matters of detail that have been discussed in cases such as Littler and RWO to which I have referred. Ultimately, with regard to those matters and the health of the accused, this case is a very different case than Littler. Bell J in RWO specifically identified matters, as the Crown submitted, reflecting upon those differences at [89] of that judgment.
	
	
	Another matter initially raised by the accused was the absence of the statement from Sergeant Banfield. The written submissions of the applicant obviously predate the production of the further material to which I have referred. The statement of Mr Banfield apparently made on 25 May 2015, offers little consolation to anybody. He has very little recollection, if any, of relevant events and probably will not be of much assistance to cast further light upon the occurrence pad entry.
	
	
	However, the occurrence pad entry is available to be considered in its terms and may be of material assistance to both the prosecution and the defence. It provides evidence of a complaint in general terms about the accused's conduct, but it also contains relevant hearsay evidence that may be admissible under the Evidence Act of retraction by the complainant, matters relating to the questionable veracity of the complaint in the eyes of the maker of the occurrence pad entry, the accused's denial and other matters.
	
	
	As often happens these matters are common in such cases. If the occurrence pad entry is admissible pursuant to any relevant provision of the Evidence Act, or inadmissible as the case may be, this is a matter for the Court in due course to determine. It seems to me with respect to Sergeant Banfield's lack of recollection of events by reference to the terms of the occurrence pad, that is a matter of no great moment and can be dealt with again by appropriate direction and warnings. Or, if needs be, by appropriate examination and/or cross-examination of the author of the occurrence pad entry who will be available to give evidence notwithstanding his current lack of memory.
	
	
	The claims of the absence of any specific school records is again a matter that can be dealt with by appropriate direction. One would have thought, however, given the statement of KK, and she is available to be cross-examined, that her recollection of relevant events and her recollection of representations made by the complainant may point to the fact that the absence of school records may well be a very good thing for the accused, not necessarily a bad thing.
	
	
	In this respect the statement of Ms K in the context of the complainant's allegations and her alleged complaints appears to be a statement of pertinence that appears to be largely unblemished by delay. Subject to the testing of the accuracy of her recollection, which is a matter that may work to the accused's advantage, assuming that the evidence is admissible for hearsay purposes pursuant to s 66 Evidence Act 1995 or admissible for non-hearsay purposes. In any event, it is of the character of evidence that has to be examined by a jury on the basis that the person who makes the relevant representations is the very person upon whom the prosecution must rely to prove the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the complaint about the absence of records of Akuna Bay and related matters, identification of people moored nearby and staff and the like. This is clearly a matter within the ambit of what was contemplated in the dicta of Gleeson CJ in the decision of McCarthy and again is a matter for which the accused should expect an appropriate warning given to the jury in his favour.
	
	
	The absence of at least one of the children of the ‘ foster parents’ by reason of a death in 2007, or thereabouts, is not a critical matter in this case, even allowing for anything that the complainant says, noting the recollection of the foster parents and the circumstances in which the complainant came to their family. There is no guarantee that GH, the foster sister, would have been able to provide any specific assistance to any party on any reasonable basis or could have even given admissible evidence of relevant representations made by the complainant to her even if they were made and even if she were alive.
	
	
	There is a live issue as to whether any representations made to her were relevantly ""fresh in the memory"". Although she falls within the category of missing witnesses because of the general delay in the timely disclosure of specific allegations, her unavailability is a matter that can again be dealt with by appropriate direction, as I have already indicated, and to my mind ultimately is not a matter contaminated by any unsatisfactory delay in bringing forward the allegations or delay in the subsequent investigation.
	
	
	The issues identified by the applicant such as the absence of corroboration and the significance of the listening device conversation are matters not of any significance, even allowing for extensive delay through no fault of the accused. The absence of supporting or corroborative evidence of the complainant, apart from being a common feature of such cases whether there be recent complaint or delayed complaint, is a matter upon which appropriate comment can be made and direction given if needs be by the trial judge.
	
	
	I note, of course, that in the intervening time since 1987 or shortly thereafter up until the present time, trial judges have been permitted to make what is called the ‘Murray’ direction. There is recent authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal stating that the operation of the current legislation restricts such a direction in cases of sexual assault relying upon one witness. That may be so. There are some discussions, of course, amongst judges and lawyers before judges as to aspects of that recent judgment. But even if a warning about examining the witness's evidence with great care because she gives the only evidence against the cannot be given, this is still a case where the jury would need to be told by the Crown, amongst other people, that the Crown case was entirely dependent upon the truthfulness of the complainant.
	
	
	As I said in relation to the listening device recording it is an equivocal recording. To my mind it actually works to the accused's advantage in its terms. Whether it is played or not is not a matter that is particularly pertinent. In fact, it is of no moment, in my view, in determining this application.
	
	
	Arising out of the complainant's earlier statement are issues taken up by the applicant concerning her private behaviour, treatment she has received, counselling and the like. These matters are to be considered along with the admission made by the complainant about a use of prohibited drug and are matters that may reflect in due course adversely upon a credibility. They are quintessentially matters to be considered by a jury in determining whether the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant's evidence.
	
	
	So far as the solicitor’s inquiries to locate the relevant counsellors, the particular psychiatrists and the like identified by the complainant, if it transpires that no such people existed or were not legitimate counsellors or medical practitioners, obviously, these are matters to be taken up with the complainant as relevant to the assessment of her credibility. If it be suggested that the complainant's recollection of events has been infected by her contact with a clairvoyant or a medium, from the use of drugs or other third party interventions, or from some suggestion of recovered memory, this is a matter that can initially, if need be, be examined in the form of a Basha inquiry or directly taken up by the complainant in the presence of the jury as relevant to the assessment of her truthfulness.
	
	
	The complainant has produced a further statement in relation to the matter which, to my mind, may provide further ""grist for the mill"" for the accused notwithstanding the explanation she has given. It seems, with respect to the investigation, that the obtaining of such a statement five years after the original statement in circumstances where one might have thought that proper investigation should have been undertaken in 2010 to identify some of the people to which the complainant referred in her earlier statement, is a matter that reflects adversely upon that investigation.
	
	
	Once again, these are all matters for comment and fit within the rubric of issues that can legitimately be raised in the conduct of the trial or be matters the subject of proper direction to the advantage of the accused. As to the issue of whether the complainant has ""reconstructed memory"", the concerns of the solicitor are matters, as I say, that can be addressed with the complainant irrespective of whether there has been delay, irrespective of the explanations given by the complainant. It seems that if a jury believed that it was reasonably possible that the relevant events had been reconstructed in the mind of the complainant, this would raise a basis for the jury to have a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness of the complainant and/or the reliability of her evidence. Again, these are all classic issues for a jury to determine in the context of consideration of the legal directions that are to be given.
	


Conclusion


	
	Thus, for the various reasons I have identified, I have concluded that I should not order a permanent stay of proceedings. I am not relevantly satisfied that by reason of the combination of factors identified by the applicant that the matters constitute a defect, that satisfies what could be called the ""fundamental test"" articulated in cases such as Jago, Walton and Gardiner and the other cases earlier cited.
	
	
	There has not been demonstrated the relevant fundamental defect going to the root of the proceedings that cannot be cured by direction or other actions on the part of the trial judge. The trial, obviously, will present its difficulties for the accused and for those participating in it. But not such as to render the trial unfair, provided the protections, warnings and relevant directions that I would anticipate would be given are given, as well as the appropriate steps are taken for the conduct of the trial to accommodate any particular difficulties the accused may have during the course of the trial.

		17 December 2015",2015-08-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702918,Tabbaa v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 171,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation for publication of a broadcast of and concerning the plaintiff as set out in a section of the “60 Minutes” programme broadcasted on 29 June 2014.
	
	
	These are reasons for my rulings in relation to the capacity of the imputation (d).
	
	
	The imputations pleaded in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff lied to her daughter when she said they would take her to Egypt for a holiday (lines 10-27, 64-93, 132-157).
	
	
	The plaintiff assisted in the abduction of her daughter (lines 10-27, 64-93, 132-157).
	
	
	The plaintiff conspired with her husband’s family to keep her daughter in Syria for years against her daughter’s will (lines 10-27, 64-93, 132-157).
	
	
	The plaintiff condoned her daughter being married to a cousin being a man she never met (lines 10-27, 64-93, 132-157).
	



	
	Mr Dawson, for the defendant, submits that the matter complained of, while indicating that the plaintiff lied to her daughter about the reasons for taking her to Egypt and assisting in the keeping of her there for five years, neither states nor implies that the plaintiff played any part at all in the proposed arranged marriage of the plaintiff to her cousin. Accordingly, imputation (d) cannot be conveyed.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The correct approach to a challenge to capacity of the matter complained of to convey imputations was explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [134]-[138] as follows:
	


“[134] That standard by which the issue of law raised by the separate trial was to be determined was addressed in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52; (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 (“Favell“) where the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, Kirby J generally agreeing) approved the following statement by McPherson JA in the Court of Appeal:

Whether or not [the pleading] ought to and will be struck out [as disclosing no cause of action] is ultimately a matter for the discretion of the judge who hears the application. Such a step is not to be undertaken lightly but only, it has been said, with great caution. In the end, however, it depends on the degree of assurance with which the requisite conclusion is or can be arrived at. The fact that reasonable minds may possibly differ about whether or not the material is capable of a defamatory meaning is a strong, perhaps an insuperable, reason for not exercising the discretion to strike out. But once the conclusion is firmly reached, there is no justification for delaying or avoiding that step [at] whatever stage it falls to be taken. (Emphasis added)

[135] Accordingly, the capacity determination is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony“; while it involves a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant“: Berezovsky (at [16]) per Sedley LJ delivering the judgment of the court. Implicit in Sedley LJ’s observation, is that the question of course is “what a jury could sensibly think [the words] meant” to the ordinary reasonable reader.

[136] One reason “great caution“ is mandated at the capacity stage, is because the conclusion which necessarily underpins a determination that the matter complained of is not capable of conveying the pleaded imputations is that “no reader could reasonably understand the words to bear any meaning outside the range delimited … by the judge; and that it would be ‘perverse’ for any jury to do so“: Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL [2003] EWCA Civ 1694 ; [2004] EMLR 89 (“Jameel“) (at [9]) per Simon Brown LJ (Mummery and Mance LJJ agreeing).

[137] Thus, the focus should be on the fact that the decision deprives the plaintiff of the opportunity to present his or her case to the jury, the importance of whose constitutional role in this area as representatives of the community is frequently emphasised: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin [2003] HCA 50 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1657 (“Rivkin”) (at [2]) per Gleeson CJ (who also agreed with Callinan J); (at [184]) per Callinan J. The significance of the jury’s role warrants the application of a “high threshold of exclusion”: Jameel (at [14]) per Simon Brown LJ

[138] In Favell (at [14]–[15]), the plurality appeared to apply a capacity test which asked whether challenged imputations “could reasonably be found by a jury”. This is the test adopted in this court: see Marsden (at 164) per Hunt CJ at CL (Mason P and Handley JA agreeing); Griffith v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 300 (at [19](a)); Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 254; (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81–915 (at [14]) per Beazley JA (Basten JA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing). It is consistent with the test applied when determining generally whether a case should be left to a jury: see Naxakis v Western General Hospital [1999] HCA 22; (1999) 197 CLR 269 (at [16]) per Gaudron J; (at [45]) per McHugh J; (at [66]–[67]) per Kirby J; cf Gleeson CJ (at [1]); Callinan J (at [117]–[123]). Naxakis concerned the test to be applied when directing a jury at the close of evidence to enter a verdict in favour of the defendant. Whether or not the Naxakis approach is strictly that which should be applied at a capacity determination was not argued. In any event the court is bound to follow Marsden.”


	
	It follows from those principles that the test to apply to the capacity of imputations to be conveyed is a generous one (Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186 at [6]). This is particularly the case where any publication of an ephemeral nature, such as a television broadcast, is the publication to be considered: Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158.
	
	
	The relevant portions of the matter complained of are as follows:
	



	
	There is a reference to the Ms Rania Farrah (identified by the pseudonym “Nadia”) refusing to be “forced into her marriage” after she was “kidnapped by her father’s family and taken to Syria” when she was only 13 years old. While in Syria, she was “held against her will and married off to her cousin, a man she never met”.
	
	
	The first reference to the Ms Farrah’s mother is at line 31, where Ms Hayes sets out that “Margaret” (the pseudonym applied to the plaintiff, Pamela June Tabbaa) had an unhappy marriage to Rania Farrah’s father, which was “punctuated by violence and threats”. The plaintiff fled Saudi Arabia with her children, including Rania, and came to Australia, leaving her husband behind. According to the matter complained of, she has remained separated from Rania’s father ever since (see lines 46 to 63), and he in fact remarried and had more children (lines 314 to 317), which is of significance when considering the imputation under challenge.
	
	
	The matter complained of then sets out that when she was 13 years “an extraordinary offer was made”:
	


“Rania Farrah: Mu mum told me that my eldest brother wanted to take me to Egypt. They knew that I was obsessed with Egyptology and all, all that stuff so, um they said that they’d take me there for a holiday for two weeks.

Liz Hayes: This is the beginning of the trip of a lifetime?

Rania Farrah: Yep.

Liz Hayes: You, you look pretty…

Rania Farrah: I was really excited, yeah, yep.

Liz Hayes: But the trip of a lifetime soon turned into a nightmare. After just one week in Egypt, Rania was told she would be taken to Jordan to see her father.

Rania Farrah: It was all a plan, to meet us there.

Liz Hayes: With who? Who, who?

Rania Farrah: Between him, my mother and my father.

Liz Hayes: And do you know why they had made this plan?

Rania Farrah: Well in their eyes I wasn’t doing too well, um, in Australia, Um.

Liz Hayes: What did that mean? Do you think?

Rania Farrah: Well, getting into to [sic] more trouble once I hit year seven (7) and high school, smoking a cigarette before class or, you know, wagging a day at school, um, talking to boys, um, just, things that every teenager starts to do. So they said right, I think we need to send her over there to um, get her set in her ways, they thought that it would change me.

Liz Hayes: It became abundantly clear to you then, in Jordan at least, that that two week holiday was now something else.

Rania Farrah: Um, my passport was taken and I was told that I was going to live with my grandmother.” (Lines 64 to 90)


	
	Rania Farrah describes how she was beaten by her father and brother and taken from Jordan to the Syrian capital, Damascus, where she lived for the next five years. When asked if she had any contact with her family she said:
	


“Rania Farrah: Yeah about um, a month later my Mum called and from that day onwards, she’d call me every 3 weeks.

Liz Hayes: And what did you say to your mum?

Rania Farrah: I just begged them to come home.

Liz Hayes: And what would she say?

Rania Farrah: Um, we can’t afford it, Um one more year.

Liz Hayes: And when one more year went by?

Rania Farrah: I’d ask again.

Liz Hayes: And?

Rania Farrah: The same thing was said.

Presenter: Rania Farrah had her teenage years stolen from her. She was kidnapped, held captive by relatives in Syria and married off to a cousin she had never met. Rania was as far from her native Sydney as you could imagine. A prisoner in a foreign land. Most forced marriages end up as a life sentence. But as Rania tells Liz Hayes, she had other plans.” (Lines 139 to 154)


	
	Confronted with the prospect of marriage to a man 15 years her senior, she “went along with it” (lines 174-177), but she was in fact planning to escape. When asked if the girl who lived next door (who gave her the information which helped her to escape) knew that she was a prisoner who was the subject of an arranged marriage, she replies that:
	


“Rania Farrah: Everyone knew. Everyone who’d ever met me knew. Anyone who’d ever come to the house or met my grandmother or my uncles knew.” (Lines 234-235)


	
	After her escape, Rania Farrah returned to Australia and she described how her aeroplane flew over Sydney Harbour (lines 304-305). She indicated it was a good feeling but stating “must have been how my mum felt”, which I take to be a reference to the excitement she considered her mother would have felt when she first escaped to Australia in Saudi Arabia. Ms Hayes then asks:
	


“Liz Hayes: Did your family understand what happened to you?

Rania Farrah: It was never spoken of. No one ever talked about it, no one ever asked what happened. To this day they don’t know what happened.

Liz Hayes: No one wanted to know what happened to you?

Rania Farrah: I don’t know, they just never asked. They never asked how, how I was um, feeling to be home which caused a lot more damage.” (Lines 308-313)


	
	At lines 328 to 332, Ms Hayes reveals that although the plaintiff’s husband had refused to meet with them, he “claims he has no knowledge at all of his daughter’s time in Syria”. All he would say in relation to his daughter’s marriage was that forced marriage in Australia was illegal. This leads Ms Hayes to ask the following question:
	


“Liz Hayes: A lot of people would be listening to your story and saying, how on earth did your mum allow that to happen.

Rania Farrah: I think when you’re bashed and beaten and, and terrorised for twenty (20) years by your husband and then, had the same treatment, almost, from your son after leaving your husband, then I think they just broke her.

Liz Hayes: Dr Eman Sharobeem knows some wounds can take a lifetime to heal.

Liz Hayes: Have you recovered?

Dr Eman Sharobeem: I recovered when my parents said sorry. I recovered when my father and uncles were crying for what happened to me.

Liz Hayes: She says, the responsibility of ensuring others don’t suffer similar fates is one we must all should as a community regardless of culture, race or religion.

Dr Eman Sharobeem: If you see it and you don’t act on it, you carry the guilt. You carry the consequence. You carry of being ignorant in a situation where you can step in, participate in saving other person’s life” (Lines 335-352)

The parties’ submissions


	
	Mr Dawson submits that the matter complained of paints a picture of the plaintiff as a woman who was beaten and mistreated by her husband and that, while the other imputations pleaded are conceded (for the purposes of this application) to be capable of being conveyed there is no suggestion that the plaintiff knew about, or played any part in, the proposed marriage of her daughter to her cousin who was the man she had never met. She is as much a victim as her daughter. There is no evidence that the plaintiff even knew about, let alone condoned or acquiesced in the proposed arranged marriage, which arrangements were solely made by her former husband and his family, in circumstances where the plaintiff lived thousands of miles away, and her only contact was her telephone calls to her daughter. He placed great weight on the plaintiff’s daughter’s remarks about her mother having “married the wrong man” and herself been a victim of him, as indicating that the plaintiff’s daughter (and thus the viewer) did not consider the plaintiff to have been a party to this arranged marriage.
	
	
	The ordinary reasonable viewer, watching this programme, would, in my view, place great weight upon the question asked at the end of the interview by Ms Hayes:
	
	
	“How on earth did your mum allow that to happen?”
	
	
	It is in the context of this question that the compassionate response of the plaintiff’s daughter (which sought to excuse her mother’s conduct) should be analysed Whether the ordinary reasonable listener considers that her references to the plaintiff having suffered domestic violence and as having “married the wrong man” means that this imputation is not conveyed is a matter upon which reasonable minds may differ and thus a matter for the jury.
	
	
	The ordinary reasonable listener would also have heard the statements of Dr Eman Sharobeem, who was similarly forced into marriage. Dr Sharobeen says that she forgave her own parents (referred to in the plural) after hearing them crying and saying “sorry”.
	
	
	Additionally, it is clear from the matter complained of that the plaintiff and her husband “made this plan” for their daughter together, even though the daughter was living in Australia with her mother at the time. This “plan” included not only requiring her to live in Jordan with her father, but to undergo a virginity test, being beaten by her father and brother until her aunt intervened, being held prisoner in circumstances where a forced marriage was part of her future life in a “strict Muslim world” (line 156), attending an Islamic school and learning Arabic, attending her own forced-marriage engagement party, and generally leading a life wholly submissive to the wishes of the whole of her family, including her mother, father and brother.
	
	
	Reasonable minds may differ, but it would be open to an ordinary reasonable viewer to consider that the forced marriage was an integral part of the plaintiff’s daughter being lured to travel overseas for a purported holiday and then kept imprisoned for the following five years.
	
	
	This brings me to the challenge to the word “acquiesced”, a form issue which was brought up without notice during the hearing. Mr Dawson also submitted that the word “condoned” was not a suitable word for inclusion in imputations by reason of its ambiguity.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. The word “condoned” has been used without objection in imputations in many defamation actions. It was, for example, used in eight imputations in Maitland v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 155, in Snedden v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 262 and in Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2012) 84 NSWLR 523. Possibly by coincidence, the plaintiff lost in all three of these proceedings, after defences of justification succeeded in relation to these imputations (suggestive of the likelihood that the defendants were under no illusions as to the case they had to meet, a common complaint in form arguments). In none of them was the use of the word “condoned” in an imputation the subject of any concern.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the meaning of the word “condoned” is free from ambiguity and does not require replacement by “acquiesced”, in the manner sought by Mr Dawson.
	
	
	This imputation will accordingly go to the jury, together with imputations (a), (b) and (c).
	


Application for transfer of these proceedings to the Supreme Court


	
	Mr Dawson has raised an issue of importance in relation to the case management of multiple defamation claims, an increasingly common phenomenon by reason of the failure of the uniform legislation to accommodate electronic publication.
	
	
	These proceedings are one of a series of claims brought both in this court and in the Supreme Court. The plaintiff’s husband had previously commenced proceedings in the District Court in relation to this broadcast; he has also, more recently, commenced proceedings against another media publisher, the Daily Mail, for publication of an online article the day following the Channel Nine broadcast, which discussed the contents of the matter complained of. Although there is no application to transfer the Daily Mail proceedings to the Supreme Court, the earlier proceedings commenced by Mr Tabbaa was transferred on 14 July 2015: Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 920 as Mr Tabbaa had commenced separate proceedings in that court against another corporation in the group.
	
	
	It was with this history in mind that, at the end of the imputations argument, Mr Dawson sought an extended timetable to enable him to consider whether these proceedings should also be the subject of an application for transfer to the Supreme Court. The application was opposed by counsel for the plaintiff, who sought a timetable consistent with the same timetable that was agreed today in the Daily Mail proceedings, namely for a defence to be filed by 10 September.
	
	
	Mr Dawson’s applications, and Mr Rasmussen’s opposition to it, highlight the issue of case management problems generated by multiple claims for defamation. Both parties have the issue of their respective clients’ interests at heart, in circumstances where the court must also consult its own convenience and the limited resources available for what could be not only lengthy but fact-repetitive jury trials.
	
	
	These are my reasons for directing him to bring any such application in the Supreme Court in 21 days, failing which these proceedings should have a similar timetable to the timetable in the other District Court proceedings brought by Mrs Tabbaa’s husband against the Daily Mail.
	
	
	The circumstances of the transfer of Mr Tabbaa’s first set of proceedings in this court were as follows. The plaintiff, then acting for himself, commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court in March 2015 concerning the broadcast of the same matter complained of as that which is the subject of Mrs Tabbaa’s claim. In June 2015 the plaintiff commenced fresh proceedings in the District Court for a news story on Channel Nine published in June 2014, one day after broadcast of the first matter complained of. The defendant in those proceedings was Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd. The two Channel Nine entities sought to have the second set of proceedings transferred to the Supreme Court. The plaintiff opposed this application, or alternatively sought to have both actions transferred to the District Court.
	
	
	McCallum J made the orders sought by the defendants. The similarity in content, imputations and reputation damage issues was considerable and, since the proceedings in the District Court had not yet reached a first return date at the time of the application, there was no prejudice caused to the plaintiff by any delay.
	
	
	Rulings have since been made in the Supreme Court on the form and capacity of imputations in these actions: Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 921 and Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1114 and Tabbaa v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 1115. There is a timetable in place for the filing of defences by Mr Tabbaa by 2 October 2015. Counsel for Mrs Tabbaa in these proceedings, however, seeks an order that the defence be filed by 10 September, which is the date for the defendant in the Daily Mail proceedings to file a defence.
	
	
	It is clear from the text of the matter complained of that the claims made against both Mr and Mrs Tabbaa include allegations of joint acts, although they have elected to sue separately, and in different courts. Mr Dawson’s complaint that his clients should not be put to the expense of a lengthy jury trial in two courts over similar factual issues is understandable, but it is not the only relevant factor to take into account.
	
	
	Courts are struggling to deal with the impact of electronic publication upon legislation and case management principles drafted before the impact of these new methods of communication. Where traditional print publication was involved, the concept of abuse of process could safely be limited to more than one set of proceedings over the same publication (Maple v David Syme & Co Ltd [1975] 3 NSWLR 97).
	
	
	That is no longer the case. The problem of the efficient running of multiple sets of proceedings over similar publications, or the same publication on different electronic platforms, in the same court, was flagged in Toben v Mathieson; Toben v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1530 at [3], where McCallum J commented:
	


“The appropriateness of commencing multiple proceedings where virtually identical matter is published in different versions of the same newspaper remains to be tested in this list: see Dank v Whittaker (No 2)[2013] NSWSC 1064 at [4].”


	
	The bringing of multiple proceedings in one court can be resolved by appropriate orders for consolidation, and the mere bringing of such actions does not amount to an abuse of process: Dank v Whittaker (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 732. It is an indication of how profoundly the structure of defamation claims is changing that her Honour declined to follow the majority decision in Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Cummings; Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Cummings [2013] ACTCA 37, preferring the minority decision of Higgins CJ that it may be an abuse for them to be heard separately (at [73] – [75]).
	
	
	The use of cross-vesting legislation to ensure that proceedings are brought in the forum with the closest connection (Bateman and Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd and Ors [2013] ACTSC 72) is of assistance only where proceedings have been commenced in a court other than the court with the closest connection.
	
	
	There does not appear to be any ready solution for multiple proceedings brought in different courts in the same State. The principles discussed by McColl JA in Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [134] – [141] did not extend the reasoning to proceedings in other courts over publications similar in both content and temporal terms; Mr Habib’s commencement of fresh proceedings in the District Court after losing proceedings in which the radio broadcasts had been relied upon for damages was not an abuse of process.
	
	
	The bringing of multiple defamation claims impacts on court resources. For example, Mr Dank, who commenced proceedings in Victoria as well as New South Wales, sought an order for judicial mediation because of his limited financial resources (Dank v Herald and Weekly Times Pty Ltd (ACN 004 113 937) [2015] VSC 270). Dixon J refused the application as “paradoxical” (at [4]), given the multiple claims brought by Mr Dank in New South Wales and Victoria, but additionally noted, as a factor relevant to the exercise of discretion, the imposition such a request would make on the court’s limited resources). 
	
	
	Until the uniform legislation is redrafted to bring it up to date with the significant changes wrought by electronic publication, courts will have to deal as best they can with these increasing demands on their resources. However, parties who commence multiple actions in more than one court for defamation over similar material should expect that courts will take into account case management principles of the kind set out in ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) to ensure that justice really is “just, quick and cheap”.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), the defendant’s challenge to imputation (d) is dismissed and imputations (a) to (d) will go to the jury.
	
	
	The defendant is to file any application for transfer of these proceedings to the Supreme Court, on the understanding that these proceedings overlap with the action of Mr Tabbaa against TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2015/79981), in 21 days, failing which a Defence is to be filed by 9 September 2015.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on 10 September 2015 at 9:00am.
	
	
	Defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of today.

		18 August 2015",2015-08-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702920,REGINA v OC (Oliver Curtis) [2015] NSWCCA 212,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In February 2014, the respondent was charged with conspiracy to commit insider trading. Prior to this, in March 2009, the respondent was compulsorily examined under the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act) in connection with an investigation being carried out by the Australian Securities Investment Commission (ASIC). The examination was found to have gone to matters relevant to the subject of the charge, including matters of proof relevant to sustain the charge and material relevant to the respondent’s defence. The respondent’s answers were given under a claim of privilege against self-incrimination.

Under s 19 of the ASIC Act, ASIC can carry out an examination in connection with an investigation under s 13 if ASIC has reasonable grounds to suspect some contravention of the legislation referred to in s 13. Under s 17, ASIC can prepare a report on the investigation. Under s 27(1), if a report is prepared as a result of an examination, the examination must accompany the report. In the case of an investigation relating to a serious contravention of the law, ASIC is empowered by s 18 to give a copy of the whole or part of the report to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP). Section 49 makes it clear that ASIC has investigative and prosecutorial roles and can take the record of examination into account in considering whether a person has committed an offence and, in these circumstances, may cause a prosecution to be commenced or carried on.

Section 76 of the ASIC Act provides that a statement made in an examination is admissible in evidence against a person in a proceeding unless, relevantly, it is not admissible due to s 68(3). Section 68 obliges an examinee to answer all questions, notwithstanding that they might tend to incriminate the examinee. However, s 68(3) prevents answers from being admissible in evidence against the examinee if the conditions in s 68(2) are met, namely, a claim for privilege is made before making the statement and the statement might in fact tend to incriminate the examinee.

A transcript of the respondent’s examination, or a summary of it, was provided to or read by officers of the CDPP and prosecuting counsel. In the Supreme Court, the primary judge granted the respondent a temporary stay of the proceedings brought against him pending: removal of any person from the prosecution team who had direct or derivative access to the transcript of examination; and persons not privy, directly or derivatively, to the transcript, being engaged. The Crown appealed against the order granting the temporary stay. The question which arose on appeal was whether the ASIC Act permitted persons involved in the prosecution of the respondent to have access to the respondent’s compulsory examination transcript.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, RA Hulme and Bellew JJ agreeing), allowing the appeal and ordering that the stay ordered by the primary judge be set aside:

It is a fundamental principle of the accusatorial system of criminal justice that the prosecution must discharge the onus of proof and the prosecution cannot compel the accused to assist it in the discharge of this onus. This principle remains even if the privilege against self-incrimination has been wholly or partly abrogated. ([97] (Bathurst CJ); [126] (RA Hulme J); [127] (Bellew J))

X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 308 ALR 252, applied.

The provision of the transcript of an examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act to those responsible for the prosecution of an examinee fundamentally alters the accusatorial judicial process, which begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in a criminal trial. A fundamental alteration of this nature by legislation can only be made by clear words or necessary intendment. The common law principle of legality requires that a statutory provision affecting such fundamental rights be construed, as far as the language of the provision allows, to minimise or avoid displacement of the principle. General words will rarely be sufficient to alter such rights if they do not specifically deal with the question. ([98]-[99] (Bathurst CJ); [126] (RA Hulme J); [127] (Bellew J))

X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, Potter v Minehan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277, Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union [2004] HCA 40; 221 CLR 309, Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; 245 CLR 1, Bropho v State of Western Australia [1990] HCA 24; 171 CLR 1, Coco v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 427, applied.

The principle of legality may be displaced by necessary implication if this is necessary to prevent legislation from becoming inoperative or meaningless or if the object of the provision would be frustrated. However, the implication must be necessary and will not arise merely because it may be seen as desirable. ([100]-[102] (Bathurst CJ); [126] (RA Hulme J); [127] (Bellew J))

Coco v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 427, Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49; 213 CLR 543, Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196, X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, Potter v Minehan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277, applied.

Statements made during a s 19 examination are admissible in criminal proceedings unless the conditions in s 68(2) are met. The time for determining whether these conditions are met is at the time the statements from an examination are sought to be tendered in evidence. Thus, the ASIC Act discloses, by necessary intendment, that if ASIC causes a prosecution to be commenced or carried out, the prosecutors responsible for the proceedings may be given access to the transcript of examination and, subject only to the prohibition against the direct use of self-incriminating material in s 68, can use the transcript, not only to formulate charges, but to prosecute them.

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The appellant, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the CDPP), appealed, pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), from a decision of the primary judge granting OC (the respondent), a temporary stay of criminal proceedings brought against him in the following terms ([2014] NSWSC 1392 (Trial Judgment)):
	


“[82]   The indictment presented by the Crown on 7 February 2014 be temporarily stayed, pending:

(a) Removal from the prosecution team (including but not limited to employees, officers or members of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, and counsel briefed on behalf of the Crown) of any person who has had direct or derivative access to the transcript of the examination of [C], conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, under s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth)

(‘examination transcript’); and

(b) Persons not privy, directly or derivatively, to that examination transcript being engaged.”


	
	The background to the order made by the primary judge may be summarised shortly.
	
	
	On 13 January 2013, the respondent was served with a court attendance notice charging him with conspiracy to commit the offence, colloquially known as insider trading, contrary to ss 1311(1) and 1043A(1)(d) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). An indictment charging him with this offence was presented in this Court on 7 February 2014.
	
	
	In March 2009, the respondent was served with a notice pursuant to s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) requiring him to attend an examination in connection with an investigation being carried out by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) under s 13(1) of the ASIC Act. It was not disputed in the proceedings that ASIC had power to issue the notice.
	
	
	The respondent was examined on 24 March 2009. The primary judge accepted evidence that the examination went to matters relevant to issues the subject of the charge, including matters the proof of which were necessary to sustain the charge. The primary judge also accepted that material relevant to the respondent’s defence to the charge had been revealed at the examination. It was not disputed that the answers were given under a claim of privilege against self-incrimination.
	
	
	In the Trial Judgment, the primary judge accepted, at [17], that “The examination transcript, or a summary of it, was also provided to or read by officers of ASIC involved in the investigation … including by solicitors and staff at ASIC”. She also accepted that it was subsequently read by officers of the CDPP and prosecuting counsel.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted, at [21], that neither ASIC nor the CDPP had endeavoured to meet the claims advanced by the respondent in correspondence leading up to the application for a stay that he would be prejudiced at the trial by the “prosecution team having had access to his examination transcript”. In particular, her Honour noted that no claim had been made that the content of the examination, from the perspective of the Crown, was irrelevant, or of no forensic significance in the presentation of the Crown case, or in anticipating any defence case which might be raised at trial.
	
	
	None of the factual matters to which I have referred above were disputed on appeal.
	
	
	It is convenient, prior to dealing with the reasons of the primary judge and the submission of the parties, to have regard to the legislative regime relevant to the proceedings and to its historical development.
	


The legislation

1 The ASIC Act


	
	Section 9 of the ASIC Act provides that ASIC is to consist of at least three and no more than eight members, three of which are to be fulltime members. Section 11 provides that ASIC is to have such functions and powers as are conferred on it by the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act. Section 12A(1) provides that ASIC has the powers and functions conferred on it by Div 2 of Pt 2 of the ASIC Act and certain other Acts. Section 12A(2) provides that “ASIC has the function of monitoring and promoting market integrity and consumer protection in relation to the Australian financial system”.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to set out the many functions conferred on ASIC by the Corporations Act. Generally speaking, they involve the regulation and supervision of corporations, financial advisers, financial products and markets. As will appear subsequently, ASIC also has enforcement powers in respect of contraventions of the Corporations Act and related legislation.
	
	
	Section 1 of the ASIC Act sets out the objects of the ASIC Act in the following terms:
	


“1   Objects

(1)   The objects of this Act are:

(a)   to provide for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) which will administer such laws of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as confer functions and powers under those laws on ASIC; and

(b)   to provide for ASIC’s functions, powers and business; and

(c)   to establish a Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee to provide informed and expert advice to the Minister about the content, operation and administration of the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions), about corporations and about financial products and financial markets; and

(d)   to establish a Takeovers Panel, a Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, a Financial Reporting Council, an Australian Accounting Standards Board, an Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services.

(2)   In performing its functions and exercising its powers, ASIC must strive to:

(a)   maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of the financial system and the entities within that system in the interests of commercial certainty, reducing business costs, and the efficiency and development of the economy; and

(b)   promote the confident and informed participation of investors and consumers in the financial system; and

(d)   administer the laws that confer functions and powers on it effectively and with a minimum of procedural requirements; and

(e)   receive, process and store, efficiently and quickly, the information given to ASIC under the laws that confer functions and powers on it; and

(f)   ensure that information is available as soon as practicable for access by the public; and

(g)   take whatever action it can take, and is necessary, in order to enforce and give effect to the laws of the Commonwealth that confer functions and powers on it.”


	
	Part 3 (ss 13-93AA) of the ASIC Act sets out the investigative and information gathering powers of ASIC. The general power of investigation is contained in s 13. Section 13(1) provides as follows:
	


“13(1)   ASIC may make such investigation as it thinks expedient for the due administration of the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions) where it has reason to suspect that there may have been committed:

(a)   a contravention of the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions); or

(b)   a contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction, being a contravention that:

(i)   concerns the management or affairs of a body corporate or managed investment scheme; or

(ii)   involves fraud or dishonesty and relates to a body corporate or managed investment scheme or to financial products.”


	
	Section 14 empowers the Minister to direct that ASIC investigate serious contraventions of the legislation referred to in s 13 and certain other matters, where the Minister considers it to be in the public interest to do so.
	
	
	Sections 16, 17 and 18 deal with the powers and obligations of ASIC to report on such an investigation and to distribute the report. The provisions are in the following terms:
	


“16   Interim report on investigation

(1)   Where, in the course of an investigation under this Division, ASIC forms the opinion that:

(a)   a serious contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction, has been committed; or

(b)   to prepare an interim report about the investigation would enable or assist the protection, preservation or prompt recovery of property; or

(c)   there is an urgent need for the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions) to be amended;

it must prepare an interim report that relates to the investigation and sets out:

(d)   if paragraph (a) applies—its findings about the contravention, and the evidence and other material on which those findings are based; or

(e)   if paragraph (b) applies—such matters as, in its opinion, will so enable or assist; or

(f)   if paragraph (c) applies—its opinion about amendment of that legislation, and its reasons for that opinion;

and such other matters relating to, or arising out of, the investigation as it thinks fit.

(2)   ASIC may prepare an interim report about an investigation under this Division and must do so if the Minister so directs.

(3)   A report under subsection (2) must set out such matters relating to, or arising out of, the investigation as ASIC thinks fit or the Minister directs.

17   Final report on investigation

(1)   At the end of an investigation under section 13 or 15, ASIC may prepare a report about the investigation and must do so if the Minister so directs.

(2)   At the end of an investigation under section 14, ASIC must prepare a report about the investigation.

(3)   A report under this section must set out:

(a)   ASIC’s findings about the matters investigated; and

(b)   the evidence and other material on which those findings are based; and

(c)   such other matters relating to, or arising out of, the investigation as ASIC thinks fit or the Minister directs.

18   Distribution of report

(1)   As soon as practicable after preparing a report under this Division, ASIC must give a copy of the report to the Minister.

(2)   Where a report, or part of a report, under this Division relates to a serious contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction, ASIC may give a copy of the whole or a part of the report to:

(a)   the Australian Federal Police; or

(b)   the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission or a member of the staff of the ACC (within the meaning of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002); or

(c)   the Director of Public Prosecutions; or

(d)   a prescribed agency.

(3)   Where a report, or part of a report, under this Division relates to a person’s affairs to a material extent, ASIC may, at the person’s request or of its own motion, give to the person a copy of the report or of part of the report.

(4)   The Minister may cause the whole or a part of a report under this Division to be printed and published.”


	
	Division 2 of Pt 3 of the ASIC Act deals with examinations.
	
	
	Section 19 empowers ASIC to conduct examinations in connection with its investigations. That section provides as follows:
	


“19   Notice requiring appearance for examination

(1)   This section applies where ASIC, on reasonable grounds, suspects or believes that a person can give information relevant to a matter that it is investigating, or is to investigate, under Division 1.

(2)   ASIC may, by written notice in the prescribed form given to the person, require the person:

(a)   to give to ASIC all reasonable assistance in connection with the investigation; and

(b)   to appear before a specified member or staff member for examination on oath and to answer questions.

Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 63).

(3)   A notice given under subsection (2) must:

(a)   state the general nature of the matter referred to in subsection (1); and

(b)   set out the effect of subsection 23(1) and section 68.”


	
	Section 21 confers powers on the inspector who conducts the examination. It is in the following terms:
	


“21   Requirements made of examinee

(1)   The inspector may examine the examinee on oath or affirmation and may, for that purpose:

(a)   require the examinee to either take an oath or make an affirmation; and

(b)   administer an oath or affirmation to the examinee.

Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 63).

(1A)   An offence under subsection 63(3) relating to subsection (1) of this section is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code.

(2)   The oath or affirmation to be taken or made by the examinee for the purposes of the examination is an oath or affirmation that the statements that the examinee will make will be true.

(3)   The inspector may require the examinee to answer a question that is put to the examinee at the examination and is relevant to a matter that ASIC is investigating, or is to investigate, under Division 1.

Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 63).”


	
	Section 22 of the ASIC Act provides that the examination is to take place in private. Section 23 entitles the examinee’s lawyer to attend.
	
	
	Sections 25 to 27 of the ASIC Act deal with the signing and distribution of the record of the examination. They provide as follows:
	


“25   Giving to other persons copies of record

(1)   ASIC may give a copy of a written record of the examination, or such a copy together with a copy of any related book, to a person’s lawyer if the lawyer satisfies ASIC that the person is carrying on, or is contemplating in good faith, a proceeding in respect of a matter to which the examination related.

(2)   If ASIC gives a copy to a person under subsection (1), the person, or any other person who has possession, custody or control of the copy or a copy of it, must not, except in connection with preparing, beginning or carrying on, or in the course of, a proceeding:

(a)   use the copy or a copy of it; or

(b)   publish, or communicate to a person, the copy, a copy of it, or any part of the copy’s contents.

Penalty: 10 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months, or both.

(2A)   Subsection (2) is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code.

(3)   ASIC may, subject to such conditions (if any) as it imposes, give to a person a copy of a written record of the examination, or such a copy together with a copy of any related book.

26   Copies given subject to conditions

(1)   If a copy is given to a person under subsection 24(2) or 25(3) subject to conditions, the person, and any other person who has possession, custody or control of the copy or a copy of it, must comply with the conditions.

Penalty:  10 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months, or both.

(2)   Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code.

27   Record to accompany report

(1)   If a report about the investigation referred to in section 20 is prepared under section 17, each record (if any) of the examination must accompany the report.

(2)   If:

(a)   in ASIC’s opinion, a statement made at an examination is relevant to any other investigation under Division 1; and

(b)   a record of the statement was made under section 24; and

(c)   a report about the other investigation is prepared under section 17;

a copy of the record must accompany the report.”


	
	Section 49 of the ASIC Act empowers ASIC to commence and carry on prosecutions for an offence against the ASIC Act or the Corporations Act. So far as relevant, it is in the following terms:
	


“49   ASIC may cause prosecution to be begun

(1)   This section applies where:

(a)   as a result of an investigation; or

(b)   from a record of an examination;

conducted under this Part, it appears to ASIC that a person:

(c)   may have committed an offence against the corporations legislation; and

(d)   ought to be prosecuted for the offence.

(2)   ASIC may cause a prosecution of the person for the offence to be begun and carried on.

(3)   If:

(a)   ASIC, on reasonable grounds, suspects or believes that a person can give information relevant to a prosecution for the offence; or

(b)   the offence relates to matters being, or connected with, affairs of a body corporate, or to matters including such matters;

ASIC may, whether before or after a prosecution for the offence is begun, by writing given to the person, or to an eligible person in relation to the body, as the case may be, require the person or eligible person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with such a prosecution.

Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 63).

(3A)   An offence under subsection 63(3) relating to subsection (3) of this section is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code.

…

(5)   Nothing in this section affects the operation of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983.”


	
	Section 63 of the ASIC Act makes it an offence to decline to answer a question in an examination without reasonable excuse. Section 64 makes it an offence to give false or misleading evidence at an examination.
	
	
	Section 68 deals with the privilege against self-incrimination. It provides as follows:
	


“68   Self‑incrimination

(1)   For the purposes of this Part, of Division 3 of Part 10, and of Division 2 of Part 11, it is not a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse or fail:

(a)   to give information; or

(b)   to sign a record; or

(c)   to produce a book;

in accordance with a requirement made of the person, that the information, signing the record or production of the book, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

(2)   Subsection (3) applies where:

(a)   before:

(i)   making an oral statement giving information; or

(ii)   signing a record;

pursuant to a requirement made under this Part, Division 3 of Part 10 or Division 2 of Part 11, a person (other than a body corporate) claims that the statement, or signing the record, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty; and

(b)   the statement, or signing the record, as the case may be, might in fact tend to incriminate the person or make the person so liable.

(3)   The statement, or the fact that the person has signed the record, as the case may be, is not admissible in evidence against the person in:

(a)   a criminal proceeding; or

(b)   a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;

other than a proceeding in respect of:

(c)   in the case of the making of a statement—the falsity of the statement; or

(d)   in the case of the signing of a record—the falsity of any statement contained in the record.”


	
	Division 9 of Pt 3 of the ASIC Act deals with the evidentiary use of materials obtained in the examination. The relevant sections are ss 76 and 79:
	


“76   Statements made at an examination: proceedings against examinee

(1)   A statement that a person makes at an examination of the person is admissible in evidence against the person in a proceeding unless:

(a)   because of subsection 68(3), the statement is not admissible in evidence against the person in the proceeding; or

(b)   the statement is not relevant to the proceeding and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the statement; or

(c)   the statement is qualified or explained by some other statement made at the examination, evidence of the other statement is not tendered in the proceeding and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the first‑mentioned statement; or

(d)   the statement discloses matter in respect of which the person could claim legal professional privilege in the proceeding if this subsection did not apply in relation to the statement, and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the statement.

(2)   Subsection (1) applies in relation to a proceeding against a person even if it is heard together with a proceeding against another person.

(3)  Where a written record of an examination of a person is signed by the person under subsection 24(2) or authenticated in any other prescribed manner, the record is, in a proceeding, prima facie evidence of the statements it records, but nothing in this Part limits or affects the admissibility in the proceeding of other evidence of statements made at the examination.”

“79   Objection to admission of statements made at examination

(1)   A party (the adducing party) to a proceeding may, not less than 14 days before the first day of the hearing of the proceeding, give to another party to the proceeding written notice that the adducing party:

(a)   will apply to have admitted in evidence in the proceeding specified statements made at an examination; and

(b)   for that purpose, will apply to have evidence of those statements admitted in the proceeding.

(2)   A notice under subsection (1) must set out, or be accompanied by writing that sets out, the specified statements.

(3)   Within 14 days after a notice is given under subsection (1), the other party may give to the adducing party a written notice:

(a)   stating that the other party objects to specified statements being admitted in evidence in the proceeding; and

(b)   specifies, in relation to each of those statements, the grounds of objection.

(4)   The period prescribed by subsection (3) may be extended by the court or tribunal or by agreement between the parties concerned.

(5)   On receiving a notice given under subsection (3), the adducing party must give to the court or tribunal a copy of:

(a)    the notice under subsection (1) and any writing that subsection (2) required to accompany that notice; and

(b)   the notice under subsection (3).

(6)   Where subsection (5) is complied with, the court or tribunal may either:

(a)   determine the objections as a preliminary point before the hearing of the proceeding begins; or

(b)   defer determination of the objections until the hearing.

(7)   Where a notice has been given in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), the other party is not entitled to object at the hearing of the proceeding to a statement specified in the notice being admitted in evidence in the proceeding, unless:

(a)   the other party has, in accordance with subsection (3), objected to the statement being so admitted; or

(b)   the court or tribunal gives the other party leave to object to the statement being so admitted.”


	
	Section 127 of the ASIC Act deals with confidentiality. So far as relevant, it is in the following terms:
	


“127   Confidentiality

(1)   ASIC must take all reasonable measures to protect from unauthorised use or disclosure information:

(a)   given to it in confidence in or in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers under the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions); or

(b)   that is protected information.

Note: Information given to ASIC under Part 7.5A of the Corporations Act may be taken, for the purpose of this section, to be given in confidence in connection with the performance of ASIC’s functions under that Act: see subsections 903A(5) and (6), and 906A(3) and (4), of the Corporations Act.

…

(3)   For the purposes of subsection (1), the disclosure of information by a person for the purposes of:

(a)   performing the person’s functions as:

(i)   a member, staff member or ASIC delegate; or

(ii)   a person who is acting as a member or staff member or who is authorised to perform or exercise a function or power of, or on behalf of, ASIC; or

(b)   the performance of functions or services by the person by way of assisting an ASIC delegate;

is taken to be authorised use and disclosure of the information.”

2 The Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (the DPP Act) and the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1984 (Cth) (the DPP Regulations)


	
	Section 6 of the DPP Act confers the following functions on the CDPP, as relevant:
	


“6   Functions of Director

(1)   The functions of the Director are:

(a)   to institute prosecutions on indictment for indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth; and

(b)   to carry on prosecutions of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) (not being prosecutions instituted by the Attorney‑General or a Special Prosecutor), whether or not instituted by the Director; and

…

(c)   to institute proceedings for the commitment of persons for trial in respect of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth; and

…

(e)   to carry on proceedings of a kind referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) (whether or not instituted by the Director); and

…

(n)   to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the functions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (mb) and in subsection (2).

(2)  In addition to his or her functions under subsection (1), the functions of the Director include:

(a)   functions that are conferred on the Director by or under any other law of the Commonwealth; and

(b)   such other functions as are prescribed.”


	
	Section 9(5) of the DPP Act empowers the CDPP to take over proceedings for committal for an indictable offence instituted by another person. Section 9(5A) empowers the CDPP to decline to take such proceedings any further.
	
	
	Section 10(2) of the DPP Act provides that nothing in the Act, other than s 9(5), affects the right of a person to carry on proceedings for the committal of persons for trial in respect of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Section 12 of the DPP Act deals with provision of information to the CDPP when it has taken over proceedings. It provides as follows:
	


“12   Provision of information to Director

Where a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth has been instituted, or is being carried on, by a person other than the Director and:

(a)   the Director informs the person that the Director is considering taking over the prosecution or directing that the matter be referred to the Director for the carrying on of the prosecution;

(b)   the Director takes over the prosecution or directs that the matter be referred to the Director for the carrying on of the prosecution; or

(c)   the person considers that the Director should take over the prosecution or that the matter should be referred to the Director for the carrying on of the prosecution;

the person shall furnish to the Director:

(d)   a full report of the circumstances of the matter;

(e)   a copy of the statements of any witnesses;

(f)   each material document in the possession of the person; and

(g)   such other information or material as the Director requires.”


	
	Regulation 3(1)(f) of the DPP Regulations empowers the CDPP to give advice to Commonwealth authorities on law enforcement or matters relating to law enforcement.
	


3 The Corporations Act


	
	Section 1315 of the Corporations Act provides for the institution of criminal proceedings under that Act. It is in the following terms:
	


“1315 Proceedings: how taken

(1)   Subject to this Act, in any proceedings for an offence against this Act, any information, charge, complaint or application may be laid or made by:

(a)   ASIC; or

(b)   a Commission delegate; or

(c)   another person authorised in writing by the Minister to institute the proceedings.

(2)   A delegation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), or an authorisation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), may relate to all offences, or to specified offences, against this Act.

(3)   Nothing in this section affects the operation of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983.”


	
	The Corporations Act also provides for examination by the Court. The provisions relating to such examinations, contained in Div 1 of Pt 5.9 of the Act, are limited to examinations of the affairs of companies which are under external administration: Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13; 156 FCR 501 at [87]-[89]. The Court has power to give directions about the matters to be inquired into in an examination and the procedure to be followed. It also has power to control the examinations, including the questions that may be put by ASIC or the eligible applicant for the examination, as the case may be.
	


The legislative history


	
	The legislation the subject of the present proceedings has a lengthy historical background. Section 12 of the Companies (Winding-up) Act 1847 (NSW) provided that if ordered to do so, persons involved with insolvent corporations were obliged to submit to an examination on oath before the Commissioner of Insolvent Estates and to make full discovery of the estate and effects of the company. Section 12 also provided that it was an offence to refuse to be examined, to not fully answer questions to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or to refuse to sign or subscribe to the examination.
	
	
	Section 88 of the Companies Act 1874 (NSW) empowered the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, to appoint inspectors to examine the affairs of any company incorporated under the Act on the application of shareholders holding not less than 20% of the capital of the company, or in the case of a banking company, not less than 33%. The Act (s 90) obliged officers and agents of the company to be examined on oath by the inspectors and provided for a penalty for refusing to answer any questions. Section 93 provided that a report of an inspector was admissible in evidence.
	
	
	The Act also introduced provisions empowering the Court, on the making of a winding-up order, to issue a summons for the examination of officers of the company concerning the affairs, dealings and estates of the company (ss 173 and 174). This appears to have been the precursor to Div 1 of Pt 5.9 of the present Corporations Act.
	
	
	The Companies Act 1899 (NSW) substantially re-enacted the provisions of the 1824 Act.
	
	
	The Companies Act 1936 (NSW) substantially re-enacted the provisions of the earlier legislation relating to the appointment of inspectors. However, it introduced a provision, s 117, to the effect that if it appeared to the Minister from the report that a criminal prosecution should be instituted in respect of an offence, he or she should order a prosecution to be instituted and it was the duty of all present and past officers and agents of the company to provide assistance. The provisions were also extended to permit the company, by special resolution, to appoint inspectors (s 118). This appears to have been the first occasion when the legislation anticipated that the inspector’s report would be used to consider whether criminal proceedings should be instituted.
	
	
	The Act also conferred similar powers on the Court to those contained in the earlier legislation to summons officers and agents of an insolvent company for examination (ss 253-254).
	
	
	Similar provisions relating to the appointment of inspectors were contained in the corresponding United Kingdom legislation. The 1945 Cohen Report commented on the operation of the provisions. The Report, in par [156], suggested that the Board of Trade should be given the power to appoint an inspector of its own motion, where there were reasonable grounds for suspicion of fraud or misfeasance or breach of duty. It also recommended, in par [159], that when, as a result of a report by an inspector, criminal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, it was the duty of all officers and agents of the company to give the Director all of the assistance which they were reasonably able to give.
	
	
	The Second Reading Speech for the Companies Bill 1961 (NSW) stated that the amendments in that Act were based, in part, on the Cohen Report 1945 (UK). Section 169 of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW) contained similar provisions to the earlier legislation concerning the appointment of inspectors. However, it made provision for inspectors to make interim reports or notes on the investigation. It also provided, in s 169(5), that if, from a report, it appeared to the Governor that a person was guilty of an offence in relation to the company, the Governor may refer the matter to the Minister. Section 169(6) provided that if the Minister considered that the case was one in respect of which a prosecution should be instituted, he or she should cause it to be instituted and officers and agents of the company were required to give all reasonable assistance.
	
	
	For the first time, the legislation expressly dealt with the privilege against self-incrimination. It provided as follows:
	


“171(5)   No person who is or has formerly been an officer or agent of a corporation the affairs of which are being investigated under this Division shall be entitled to refuse to answer any question which is relevant or material to the investigation on the ground that his answer might tend to incriminate him but if he claims that the answer to any question might incriminate him and but for this subsection he would have been entitled to refuse to answer the question the answer to the question shall not be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings except in the case of a charge against him for perjury committed by him in answer to that question.

(6)   Except as expressly provided in subsection (5) of this section any person shall be entitled to refuse to answer a question on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him.

(7)   An inspector may cause notes of any examination under this Division to be recorded and reduced to writing and to be read to or by and signed by the person examined and any such signed notes may except in the case of any answer which that person would not have been required to give but for the provisions of subsection (5) of this section thereafter be used in evidence in any legal proceedings against that person.”


	
	These provisions only protected against direct use of the answers. Further, s 171(7) provided that answers provided in an examination, other than those on which privilege was claimed, would be admissible in evidence.
	
	
	The 1961 Act also empowered the Governor or the Court, on the application of the Minister, to appoint inspectors. It gave such inspectors powers, including the powers of examination, to which I have referred above.
	
	
	Sections 249 and 250 also conferred power on the Court to summons persons who may have knowledge of the affairs of insolvent companies for examination. The provisions, which were generally similar to those contained in the 1936 Act, were considered by the High Court in two cases, Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; 114 CLR 63 and Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; 122 CLR 493.
	
	
	In Rees v Kratzmann, the question arose as to whether the respondent could be examined on matters outside of those the subject of a liquidator’s report, given pursuant to s 235(1) of the Companies Act 1961 (Qld) (relevantly in the same terms as the 1961 NSW Act), which formed the basis for the order for examination under s 250 of the Act. A majority (Kitto J dissenting) held that the respondent could be so examined. Each of the justices emphasised the powers of the Court to control the examination to ensure that it was not made an instrument of injustice or oppression (Barwick CJ at 66, Menzies J at 78, Taylor J agreeing, Windeyer J at 79). Windeyer J added the following comments (at 80):
	


“There is in the common law a traditional objection to compulsory interrogations. … But, strong as has been the influence of this attitude upon the administration of the common law, of the criminal law especially, it must be admitted that in the Chancery Court it had less place : and in bankruptcy jurisdiction it has been largely displaced. For example, a debtor upon his public examination in bankruptcy cannot refuse to answer questions on the ground that the answers may incriminate him (Re Paget; Ex parte Official Receiver [1927] 2 Ch. 85.; Re Jawett [1929] 1 Ch. 108.), the purpose of the bankruptcy statute being to secure a full and complete examination and disclosure of the facts relating to the bankruptcy in the interests of the public. The provisions of The Companies Act reflect, it seems to me, the same idea. The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.”


	
	In Mortimer v Brown, the High Court unanimously held that in a public examination under s 250, an examinee may not decline to answer a question on the ground that the answers may tend to incriminate him or her. Barwick CJ agreed with Walsh J and made the following observations (at 495):
	


“The Parliament has made it abundantly clear that the so-called right to be silent which the common law sought to protect was not to be available to the examinee: and, as both my brother Kitto and my brother Walsh observe, the very purpose of the inquiry makes such a course inevitable if that purpose is not frustrated and the inquiry rendered nugatory. The common law cannot maintain a right in the citizen to refuse to make incriminating answers in the face of a statute which by its expression clearly intends, as does the present, that all questions allowed to be put shall be answered.”


	
	Kitto J agreeing, also emphasised the policy of the section and that a reading down to allow the immunity would render the provisions nugatory. He expressed his conclusion as follows (at 496):
	


“But however this may be, on the question that is now before us the circumstance which I find compelling is that the evident purpose of the section, primarily even if not wholly, is to enable a suggestion of fraud or concealment of a material fact to be fully investigated by means of the public examination of certain classes of persons. Such a question in its nature must frequently involve consideration of evidence tending to incriminate individuals. To read down the wide terms of the section so as to allow a danger of self-incrimination as a valid ground for refusing to answer a question would render the provision relatively valueless in the very cases which call most loudly for investigation. By providing in sub-s. (7) (c) that notes of a person's examination may thereafter be used in evidence in any legal proceedings against him, the section shows that the possibility of self-incrimination is contemplated as being inherent in the kind of examination that is authorized. In the light of that provision the absence of an express saving of the ordinary right of objection, coupled with the conferring upon the court in unqualified terms of a general discretion as to the questions that must be answered, leaves no room for an inference, which there is nothing to suggest unless it be the fact that the examination is before a court, that a tendency to incriminate is a valid ground for refusing to answer a question even where the court would be prepared to allow it in the exercise of a discretion.”


	
	Walsh J, with whom Owen J agreed, reached the same conclusion. In doing so, his Honour expressed his agreement with the remarks of Windeyer J in Rees v Kratzmann, to which I have referred in par [45] above. He also concluded (at 502) that “it would not be in accordance with the plain language of the section to hold that the possibility of self-incrimination must be regarded by the court as decisive against allowing a question to be put”.
	
	
	Significant amendments were made to the 1961 Act by the Companies (Amendment) Act 1971 (NSW). Relevantly, the provisions of s 171(5), (6) and (7) were repealed and replaced by s 174(3), which was in the following terms:
	


“174(3)   The officer is not excused from answering a question put to him by the inspector on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him but, where the officer claims, before answering the question, that the answer might tend to incriminate him, neither the question nor the answer is admissible in evidence against him in criminal proceedings other than proceedings under subsection (1) of this section or in relation to a charge of perjury in respect of the answer.”


	
	Section 174(1) provided that it was an offence to refuse to take an oath, fail to comply with the requirement of an inspector or make a false statement.
	
	
	Section 176(5) conferred additional powers on the Minister to supply notes of the examination to a duly qualified legal practitioner who was acting for a person who was conducting or was contemplating, in good faith, legal proceedings in relation to offences the subject of the investigation.
	
	
	Similar but not identical provisions concerning examinations were contained in the Securities Industry Act 1976 (NSW) and the Securities Industry Act 1980 (Cth). The latter Act conferred examination powers on an inspector to examine prescribed persons on an investigation into dealing in securities. Unlike the Companies Act 1961 or the Companies Act 1981, the legislation was not restricted to officers of the corporation, prescribed persons being defined in s 15(1) as persons “suspected or believed by an inspector, on reasonable grounds, to be capable of giving information concerning any matter being, or to be, investigated by the inspector”. Section 19(9) abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination for prescribed persons, but prohibited direct (not derivative) use of such answers in criminal proceedings against the examinee (other than in proceedings concerning the alleged falsity of an answer).
	
	
	The Companies Act 1981 (Cth), adopted in New South Wales by the Companies (New South Wales) Act 1981 (NSW), provided for special investigations. The legislation provided, in s 296(7), that an officer of the corporation the subject of the investigation could not be excused from answering questions on the ground of self-incrimination, but the answer would not be admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings against him or her. However, the answer would be available in criminal proceedings for a contravention of the requirements of the section not to give false and misleading answers, proceedings for failing to take an oath or failing to comply with a direction or proceedings in respect of the falsity of the answer. The admissibility of the evidence of the examinations in subsequent proceedings was dealt with in s 299. It was in the following terms:
	


“299(1)   Except as provided by sub-section (2), any questions asked and answers given at an examination of a person under this Part are admissible in evidence in any criminal or civil proceedings against the person.

(2)   Evidence of an answer given by a person at an examination under this Part shall not be admitted in evidence in criminal or civil proceedings against the person if -

(a)   the proceedings are criminal proceedings (other than proceedings for an offence against sub-section 296 (2), (3) or (4) or other proceedings in respect of the falsity of the answer) and, before answering the question, the person claimed that the answer might tend to incriminate him;

(b)   the question and answer are not relevant to the proceedings and the person objects to the admission of the evidence;

(c)   the answer is qualified or explained by some other answer given at the examination, evidence of the other answer is not tendered in the proceedings and the person objects to the admission of the evidence of the first-mentioned answer; or

(d)   the answer disclosed matter in respect of which a claim of legal professional privilege could be made by the person in the proceedings if the provisions of this Division did not apply in relation to that evidence, and the person objects to the admission of the evidence.

(3)   This section applies whether the proceedings against the person examined are heard alone or together with proceedings against another person.”


	
	Section 303 made provision for dealing with objections to the admissibility of such statements in evidence in terms generally similar to s 79 of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	The Act contained similar provisions to its predecessor, giving the Court power to summons persons to be examined concerning the affairs of insolvent companies. These provisions were considered by the High Court in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486. That case involved an examination of the respondent, who had previously been charged with a number of offences relating to matters the subject of the examination. The Court held that s 541(12) of the Companies Act 1981, which provided that a person should not be excused from answering questions on the grounds that the answer might incriminate him or her, but if he or she claimed it might do so, the answer was not admissible in criminal proceedings, abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination. The majority (Deane and Gaudron JJ dissenting) held that neither the provisions of s 541(5), empowering the Supreme Court to give directions as to the matters to be inquired into, nor the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to control its own proceedings, authorised the Court to reject a question merely because it may have tended to incriminate the examinee.
	
	
	Mason CJ, who formed part of the majority, accepted that the privilege could only be abrogated by the manifestation of a clear legislative intention through express words or necessary implication. He stated that “the phrase ‘necessary implication’ imports a high degree of certainty as to legislative intention”: at 495. He noted that there had been a long history of legislation relating to examinations in bankruptcy and under the Companies Acts which abrogated or qualified the right to refuse to answer questions on the ground of self-incrimination. He referred to the statement of Windeyer J in Rees v Kratzmann, to which I have referred above in par [45].
	
	
	In rejecting the proposition that s 541(5) empowered the Court conducting the examination to reject questions merely on the ground that they might tend to incriminate the examinee, his Honour made the following remarks (at 497):
	


“In the light of the statutory provisions and the public purposes which I have outlined it would be going too far altogether to view the existence of the discretion as requiring ordinarily the giving of directions which will protect the witness from the consequences of abrogation of the privilege in so far as they include the derivative use of the answers of the witness. To give such directions as a matter of course would be to frustrate the statutory purpose. Clearly the lengthy delay of an examination due to the pendency of criminal charges would be highly likely to frustrate the liquidator in the carrying out of his duties towards the company and the creditors by denying him the use of a major instrument in the tracing of assets.”


	
	Deane and Gaudron JJ reached a contrary view on the application of s 541(5). Their Honours made the following remarks:
	


“Public adherence to the procedure of claiming privilege followed by the equally public giving of answers thus acknowledged as tending to incriminate may involve an additional and greater unfairness to the examinee, notwithstanding that the answers given may not be used in the trial of the pending charge. For example, quite apart from the danger of the creation of an atmosphere of pre-trial prejudice, there is the possibility that the answer may involve the disclosure of a defence or lead to the discovery of other evidence, these being consequences against which a person charged with a criminal offence is usually entitled to be protected. See Rank Film Ltd. v. Video Information Centre [1982] A.C. 380, at p. 443; Sorby (1982) 152 C.L.R., at pp. 293-294.”


	
	The investigation powers were again amended by the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth). The Act was, in many respects, similar to the present ASIC Act. However, s 68(3) conferred a wider immunity from the use of self-incriminating answers. It provided as follows:
	


“68(3)   Neither the statement, or the fact that the person has signed the record or produced the book, as the case may be, nor, in the case of the making of a statement or the signing of a record, any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record, as the case may be, is admissible in evidence against the person in:

(a)   a criminal proceeding; or

(b)   a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;

other than a proceeding in respect of

(c)   in the case of the making of a statement – the falsity of the statement; or

(d)   in the case of the signing of a record – the falsity of any statement contained in the record.”


	
	That protection was limited to direct use immunity by the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Act 1992 (Cth), the amended section being in the same terms as now appears in the ASIC Act. The Explanatory Memorandum explained the purpose of the amendment in the following terms:
	


“The proposed amendments to the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the Corporations Law contained in section 82 of the Corporations Act 1989 arise from practical experience of the operation of the present provisions in the national scheme legislation for companies and securities which relate to the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination. Serious difficulties in investigations and prosecutions have been caused by the compensatory provision that neither a person’s self-incriminatory statements, nor the signing of a record nor the fact of having produced a book (‘use immunity’), nor any information of material derived from, or obtained as a result of, these statements or actions (‘derivative use immunity’) are admissible in evidence against the person in criminal proceedings and other proceedings for the recovery of a penalty.

The major problems are caused by:

the derivative use immunity which places an excessive burden on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the negative fact that any item of evidence (of which there may be thousands in a complex case) has not been obtained as a result of information subject to the use immunity; and

that aspect of the use immunity which prevents the admission into evidence of the fact that a person, having claimed that to do so might tend to be self-incriminatory, has produced a book (which is broadly defined to include virtually all business-related records). This immunity may prevent a person from being linked in the chain of evidence with the documents which establish the commission of a corporate offence, preventing any effective prosecution of that person.”

The reasoning of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge, in the Trial Judgment, rejected the proposition that s 18 or s 127 of the ASIC Act authorised disclosure of the contents of the respondent’s examination to those officers of the CDPP responsible for the prosecution or those retained by the CDPP to conduct it. She concluded that neither provision expressly or impliedly referred to the examination transcript per se: at [29]. She said that the fact that s 17(3)(b) required that a report (referred to as a report under s 18(3)(c)) set out the evidence on which the finding of the investigation was based, does not require the answers given at an examination, particularly the self-incriminating ones, to be disclosed: at [29].
	
	
	The primary judge noted the submission by the CDPP that “Parliament has not provided a statutory prohibition against disclosure”, which was consistent with there being no restriction in the ASIC Act on the use of an examination transcript by ASIC or the CDPP: at [33]. Her Honour also noted the CDPP’s submission that this was made manifest by the inclusion of Div 9 Pt 3 of the ASIC Act, concerning the evidentiary use of the material. She described this as the “mainstay of the [CDPP’s] submission that the Parliament has, by necessary intendment or implication, authorised disclosure to the CDPP” of the examination transcript: at [34].
	
	
	In considering this submission, the primary judge noted that s 22 required the examination to take place in private. However, she rejected the submission that this was overtaken by s 49, which empowered ASIC to consider the examination transcript in deciding whether criminal proceedings should be commenced.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted that “s 49(1) expressly contemplates that officers within ASIC may utilise an examination transcript for the purpose of making an informed decision under s 49(2) as to whether to charge a person with a criminal offence”: at [47]. However, she stated that “s 49 is silent as to whether the material … may also be made available to the CDPP” when prosecuting an offence pursuant to s 6(1)(a) and (b) of the DPP Act: at [47]. She thus concluded that the section left open whether the CDPP should also have the examination transcript: at [48]. Further, she stated that the question remained as to whether Parliament intended that offences against the corporations legislation, prosecuted on indictment, were to be conducted according to principles different to the fundamental principles of an accusatorial system: at [53]. She concluded that it was “both practical and achievable, consistently with the precepts of the general law, for that information to be quarantined to ensure that there is no risk of unfairness to that person in the conduct of any subsequent curial proceedings, whether those proceedings involve the imposition of civil penalties or criminal sanctions”: at [56].
	
	
	The primary judge noted the CDPP’s submission that ss 76 and 79 of the ASIC Act demonstrated that Parliament intended that the prosecuting authorities be provided with the accused’s entire examination transcript in order to make an informed decision to tender it in proof of guilt.
	
	
	In dealing with the issue, the primary judge referred to the decisions of Corboy J in R v Catena (No 3) [2013] WASC 97 and Smith v The Queen; Corp v The Queen [2007] WASCA 163; 35 WAR 201 (Smith). In the latter case, the Western Australian Court of Appeal considered that the time for considering when the privilege against self-incrimination was properly invoked, for the purpose of s 68(2)(b) of the ASIC Act, was at the time that the statement was sought to be tendered under s 76. In the Trial Judgment, her Honour concluded that the reasoning in Smith was “expressly confined to proceedings in respect of the falsity of a statement made under a s 19 examination”: at [76]. Her Honour concluded that to the extent that Catena (No 3) gave the section a wider operation, it should not be followed. She expressed her conclusions in the following terms (at [79]):
	


“[79]   To the extent that Corby J considered that his views as to the intended operation of s 76 were consistent with the statutory scheme [in] the ASIC Act (in particular s 49), I respectfully disagree. The intended operation of s 49 is clear enough. However, in the absence of a sufficiently clear and unambiguous implication in s 49 that Parliament intended that the CDPP have unrestricted access to the entirety of a s 19 examination transcript (or that the construction of the Act generally leads irresistibly to that conclusion), I am not satisfied that s 49 operates to modify the fundamental principles of an accusatorial system of criminal justice in the unqualified way contended for by the respondent. Neither am I satisfied that on their proper construction ss 76 or 79 have that effect in the context of criminal proceedings prosecuted on indictment for contraventions of the corporations legislation. Self-evidently, were the accused to rely upon statements in his or her examination transcript, at his or her election, there would be no abrogation of the principle that the Crown prove its case unassisted by the accused and an application for access to the transcript in either an abridged or unabridged form might be made to the trial judge.”

The parties’ submissions


	
	The CDPP accepted that it was “a fundamental principle of the accusatorial system of criminal justice that an accused cannot be required to provide any information or assistance to the Crown and can insist on the Crown proving its case”. However, it pointed out that it was well-established that Parliament may enact legislation modifying this principle. It submitted that this had occurred in the present case.
	
	
	In that context, the CDPP pointed to the fact that “ASIC has the express function of investigating whether there has been a contravention of law, particularly the corporations legislation”. It pointed out that, for this purpose, ASIC was given the power to conduct examinations and it had the right, and in some cases the obligation, to provide a report which, by virtue of s 27 of the ASIC Act, was required to include the s 19 transcripts.
	
	
	The CDPP also pointed to the fact that, in addition to its investigatory function, ASIC had enforcement functions. It pointed out that s 49(1)-(2) of the ASIC Act contemplated that where, as a result of an investigation or from a record of an examination, it appeared to ASIC that a person may have committed offences for which the person ought to be prosecuted, ASIC may cause a prosecution to be brought or carried on. It also pointed to the fact that these subsections contemplated that the record of examination could be used to determine whether a person should be prosecuted.
	
	
	The CDPP submitted that the reference to ASIC “causing a prosecution … to be begun and carried on” in s 49(2) of the ASIC Act expressly contemplated that some prosecutions would be carried on by the CDPP. It submitted that when a prosecution is to be carried out by the CDPP, it was “necessarily implicit that the CDPP must be provided with sufficient information to enable it to provide informed advice to ASIC on whether or not charges should be laid and the particular offences to be prosecuted”. It submitted that disclosure of information to the CDPP would be for the purpose of ASIC officers performing their functions and would thus fall within s 127(3) of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	In his submissions on behalf of the CDPP at the hearing of the appeal, the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth summarised the nature and function of ASIC as a body devoted to the administration, including the enforcement, of specialist legislation and as an investigating and prosecutorial body. He submitted that these factors informed the use and disclosure it may make of the product of its examinations. He submitted that the primary judge was correct in accepting that s 49(1) of the ASIC Act contemplated that officers may use the transcript of examinations for the purpose of making an informed decision as to whether or not to charge a person with a criminal offence. However, he submitted that the section also entitled ASIC to go beyond that and have access and make use of the transcript throughout the whole of the prosecution if it was the sole prosecutor. He also submitted that where the CDPP takes over the prosecution, s 49(2) contemplated that it would have all of the material that was available to ASIC.
	
	
	The Solicitor-General pointed to the form of the order made by the primary judge, prohibiting members of the prosecution team who had direct or derivative access to the transcript from being involved in the prosecution. He submitted that this would exclude a person from making an informed decision as to whether to prosecute. He pointed to the fact that the primary judge’s order would require that there be two teams within ASIC, one team involved in the decision to prosecute, who could have access to the record, and a separate team “uninfected by the record” to instruct and assist the CDPP. He submitted that such a bifurcation could not have been contemplated by the legislature.
	
	
	The Solicitor-General also referred to the history of the legislation, to which I have referred above, submitting that since at least 1847, there had been a “second stream of executive inquiry under compulsion without court supervision”. He submitted that the historical analysis showed that the legislature moved from no protection against self-incrimination to protection against direct use and derivative use and back to direct use. He submitted that support for the construction contended for by the CDPP could be derived from the comments made by Mason CJ in Hamilton v Oades, to which I have referred above in pars [56]-[57]. He submitted, referring to that case, that the combined force of ss 19, 21, 63 and 68 of the ASIC Act was that both the privilege against self-incrimination and the associated right to silence had been abrogated in respect of one category of information; the product of a compulsory examination. He submitted that in respect of this category of information, the abrogation “has occurred once and for all”.
	
	
	The Solicitor-General also placed reliance on the purpose of the examination, namely, to ascertain whether the suspicion of a contravention, which underpinned the compulsory examination, was sound and, if sound, it supported a prosecution under s 49 of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	The Solicitor-General submitted that the combined effect of ss 18, 25, 49, 68, 76 and 127 of the ASIC Act was that the Act controlled who could gain access to the record of examination and how it could be used in evidence. He pointed to the fact that s 76 provided that the record could be used in evidence and was prima facie evidence of the statements it recorded, even in criminal proceedings. He submitted that a statement would only be inadmissible under s 68(3) if both of the requirements of s 68(2) were met, namely, the examinee claims the privilege and the statements in respect of which the privilege was claimed did in fact tend to incriminate the examinee. He submitted that even in cases where s 68(3) applied, the accused could seek to tender the material, in which case the prosecutor would require access to it to assess its admissibility.
	
	
	The CDPP submitted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the potential application of ss 68(3) and 76(1) was confined to proceedings where a person was being prosecuted for the falsity of a statement made in the examination. It submitted that an analysis of Smith did not lead to this conclusion.
	
	
	The CDPP submitted that its interpretation of ss 68 and 76 of the ASIC Act was supported by other cases, referring to: R v Anthony David Holmes [1996] TASSC 163; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Fortescue Metals Group (No 2) [2009] FCA 424; 176 FCR 529 (civil penalty proceedings); R v Donaldson and Poumako [2009] SASC 31; 103 SASR 309; Catena (No 3); and R v Jacobson (Ruling No 4) [2014] VSC 508; 290 FLR 143. The CDPP also submitted that the primary judge was in error in stating that ASIC’s power to provide a report of the investigation to the CDPP did not authorise provision of the transcript. In that context, it referred to s 27(1) of the ASIC Act, which states that any final report must be accompanied by the record of examination.
	
	
	In relation to the decision of the High Court in Lee v R [2014] HCA 20; 308 ALR 252 (Lee (No 2)), relied on by the primary judge and the respondent, the CDPP pointed to the fact that there was no equivalent to s 13(9) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) (the NSWCC Act) in the ASIC Act. It pointed to the fact that s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act operated prior to any trial, in contrast with the ASIC Act, which, it submitted, provided that the question of whether a statement would tend to incriminate an examinee would be determined at the trial.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal, the Solicitor-General pointed to the fact that following the 1992 amendments to the then ASIC Act, there was no derivative use immunity. He submitted that this confirmed that all persons with lawful access to the record for the purpose of the proceeding could use it for all purposes connected with the proceedings. He submitted that s 49 of the ASIC Act did not require ASIC to “erect a Chinese wall or engage a different legal team at each stage”.
	
	
	The Solicitor-General also submitted that the CDPP could be involved at each stage of the proceedings: in giving advice to ASIC on whether there was a fit case to prosecute; in consenting to the commencement of conspiracy proceedings; or in carrying on committal proceedings or proceedings on indictment. He submitted that that necessarily implied that the CDPP was authorised to inform itself and make use of the product of the s 19 examination in any of the ways that ASIC could do so.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that no error warranting appellate intervention was established. He submitted that the primary judge’s reasoning conformed with the requirements set out in Lee (No 2) (at [32]) that clear words or words of necessary intendment are necessary to alter the fundamental principles of the accusatorial system. He submitted that the question which Lee (No 2) directed be considered was whether “the only constructional choice open is one whereby the ASIC Act necessarily abrogates the right of OC to require the Crown to prove its case unassisted by the accused, including by allowing the persons responsible for prosecuting him to have access to statements within the Transcript”.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that “s 49 empowers ASIC to have regard to the result of an investigation or a record of examination conducted under s 19 in order to determine whether” to prosecute. He submitted, however, that the legislation was “silent as to whether ASIC officers privy to the examination transcript must be quarantined from any team entrusted with the conduct of any prosecution”. He submitted, referring to what was said by Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 (X7) at [142], that for legislation to have the necessary implication to take away a fundamental right, “the implication must be necessary, not just available or somehow thought to be desirable”. He submitted that properly understood, s 49 did not speak to the matters under consideration in the present case.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that s 68(3) contemplated “an exception in respect of proceedings concerning the falsity of a statement made [in an examination]; that is, a charge of perjury”. He submitted that the section was silent as to circumstances in which the transcript could be used otherwise.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that s 76(1)(a) restated the operation of s 68(3). Relying on the construction contended for in respect of the latter section, he submitted that the issues of false or contradictory evidence could only arise once the proceeding was on foot. He submitted that in these circumstances, ASIC could properly review the transcript and bring matters to the attention of the CDPP for the limited purpose identified in s 68(3).
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the effect of Lee (No 2) was that “the Court must commence with the basal premise that the precepts of a criminal trial cannot be disturbed save by express statutory authorisation”. He submitted that the “focal precepts” of such a trial included that “the onus of proof rests upon the prosecution” and “an accused person cannot be required to testify to the commission of the offence charged”. He submitted that, combining these principles, the prosecution “cannot compel the accused to assist it”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondent pointed to the absence of any constraint in the questioning in an examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act, contrasting it with the examination by the Court considered in Hamilton v Oades. He pointed out that the fact that questioning could be constrained was of importance in Hamilton v Oades. Further, he submitted that the majority of the High Court in Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 (Lee (No 1)) relied on the fact of Court supervision to reach a conclusion different to that reached in X7.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondent emphasised that it was not contended that the CDPP should not have access to the examination transcript for the purpose of advising whether charges should be brought, but rather, that those persons actually involved in the prosecution of the charges should not have access to that material.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that Catena (No 3) was decided incorrectly. He submitted that s 76(1)(a) only had application in criminal proceedings where falsity is an element of an offence charged, namely, when proceedings fall within the exception in s 68(3)(c) and (d). He submitted that even if the decision in Smith was correctly applied in Catena (No 3), it must now be considered in light of X7 and Lee (No 2).
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the respondent submitted that the primary judge was correct in accepting what he referred to as the “residual discretionary argument”. This argument was that even if the CDPP’s construction of the ASIC Act was accepted, there was no reason why, in this particular case, the trial team needed the transcript and the primary judge was entitled, as a matter of discretion, to order the stay due to “the unchallenged evidence in this case as to the prejudice or the advantage” of the transcript.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions filed after the conclusion of the hearing, the respondent sought to clarify his submissions made in respect of the operation of ss 68 and 76. He submitted that one available construction of those provisions was that s 68(2) conditions the application of s 68(3). He submitted that either of the two conditions in s 68(2) may not be satisfied. He submitted that if the condition in s 68(2)(a) was not satisfied (no claim of privilege against self-incrimination before a statement), then the statement may be admissible. By contrast, he submitted that the precondition in s 68(2)(b) may not be capable of assessment until a later time, such as when a charge is laid. However, he submitted that that did not mean that all oral statements made at an examination were available to individuals conducting the prosecution. He submitted that this was not required either expressly or by necessary implication, as any argument as to whether the preconditions were satisfied could be conducted by a separate “voir dire team”. He submitted that, in any event, the problem did not arise in the present case as there was no evidence to suggest whether or not s 68(3) was likely to be engaged.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the primary judge did not conclude that neither s 18 nor s 127 authorised an ASIC officer to make a transcript available to the CDPP, as distinct from those officers actually carrying out the prosecution. Rather, he accepted that there were circumstances where the transcript could be provided. However, he said that the critical question was whether “there had been a miscarriage of justice in the eyes of the law”.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the 1992 amendments to the then ASIC Act, to remove the protection from derivative use of self-incriminating material, did not alter the position, as those amendments were not directed to the basal evidentiary position engaged by Lee (No 2).
	
	
	The respondent also submitted that the primary judge was correct in concluding that s 49 did not require, as a matter of necessary intendment, that any officer or other person involved in the prosecution should be entitled to rely on the record. He submitted that the ASIC Act did not speak of the CDPP using the record for the purpose of a prosecution.
	
	
	In submissions in reply, filed with leave after the hearing, the CDPP stated that “The ultimate question before the Court is whether the legislation in question, either expressly or by necessary intendment, puts the accused in a position different from that under the ‘pure’ accusatorial system”. It submitted that this identification of the issue demonstrated the difference between the statutory scheme of the ASIC Act in the present case and that in Lee (No 2). He submitted that in Lee (No 2), it was not only the alteration of the balance between the Crown and the accused which led to a finding that there was a miscarriage of justice, in addition, there was no legislative authority for the alteration. He submitted that in Lee (No 2), the alteration occurred contrary to the evident purposes of s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act and the evidence was inadmissible in any court proceedings by virtue of s 18B(2) of the NSWCC Act, contrary to the position in ss 68 and 76(1)(a) of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	By contrast, the respondent submitted that s 18B(2) of the NSWCC Act served the same purpose as s 68 of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	The CDPP further submitted that if there was a legal error as it contended, there was no alternate discretionary basis on which the conclusion of the trial judge could be justified.
	


Consideration


	
	It was not disputed by the CDPP that it is a fundamental principle of the accusatorial system of criminal justice that the prosecution must discharge the onus of proof and that the prosecution cannot compel the accused to assist it in the discharge of this onus: X7 at [101]-[102], [124], [159]; Lee (No 2) at [32]-[33]. Further, the principle remains even if the privilege against self-incrimination has been wholly or partly abrogated: Lee (No 2) at [33].
	
	
	It was also accepted that the privilege against self-incrimination remains, at least so far as direct use of the self-incriminatory material is concerned. However, the provision of the transcript of a s 19 examination to those responsible for the prosecution of an examinee fundamentally alters the accusatorial judicial process, which begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in a criminal trial: X7 at [124].
	
	
	A fundamental alteration of this nature made by legislation can only be made by clear words or necessary intendment: X7 at [125]; Potter v Minehan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277 at 304; Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union [2004] HCA 40; 221 CLR 309 (Electrolux Home Products) at [19]-[21]. As was pointed out by Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; 245 CLR 1 at [512], the principle of legality at common law requires that a statutory provision effecting such fundamental rights (in that case the presumption of innocence) be construed, so far as the language of the provision allows, to minimise or avoid displacement of the principle: see also French CJ at [43]. It has been pointed out on a number of occasions that general words will rarely be sufficient to alter such rights if they do not specifically deal with the question: Bropho v State of Western Australia [1990] HCA 24; 171 CLR 1 at 18; Coco v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 427, 437-438.
	
	
	In Coco, the majority stated that the principle may be displaced by necessary implication “if it is necessary to prevent the statutory provisions from becoming inoperative or meaningless”: at 438. In Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49; 213 CLR 543, McHugh J pointed out, at [43], that courts will hold that legislation alters such rights by necessary implication if the object of the provision would be largely frustrated if the right, freedom or immunity was to be preserved.
	
	
	In Lee (No 1), Gageler and Keane JJ, after citing the passages from Electrolux Home Products to which I have referred above in par [99], stated that while the principle of legality extends to the protection of fundamental principles, it should not be extended beyond its rationale “to protect from inadvertent and collateral alteration [of] rights, freedoms, immunities, principles and values that are important within our system of representative and responsible government”: at [313]. They went on to make the following remarks:
	


“[314]   The principle of construction is fulfilled in accordance with its rationale where the objects or terms or context of legislation make plain that the legislature has directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of the right, freedom or immunity in question and has made a legislative determination that the right, freedom or immunity is to be abrogated or curtailed. The principle at most can have limited application to the construction of legislation which has amongst its objects the abrogation or curtailment of the particular right, freedom or immunity in respect of which the principle is sought to be invoked. The simple reason is that ‘[i]t is of little assistance, in endeavouring to work out the meaning of parts of [a legislative] scheme, to invoke a general presumption against the very thing which the legislation sets out to achieve’.” [Internal citations omitted]


	
	Nonetheless, the implication must be necessary and will not arise merely because it may be seen as available or desirable: X7 at [142].
	
	
	The ASIC Act does not expressly provide that persons actually involved in the prosecution of a person who has been compulsorily examined can have access to the transcript of the examination. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the ASIC Act has provided so by necessary implication, in accordance with the principles to which I have referred above. Construction of the ASIC Act must begin with a consideration of the text itself. It will also require consideration of the context of the ASIC Act, including the general purpose and policy of the relevant provisions: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [47]; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69].
	
	
	ASIC may carry out an examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act in connection with an investigation under s 13. It is a precondition to such an examination that ASIC has reasonable grounds to suspect some contravention of the legislation referred to in that section. Section 17 empowers ASIC to prepare a report on the investigation, which must set out the evidence on which any findings are based. In the case of an investigation relating to a serious contravention of the law, ASIC is empowered by s 18 to give a copy of the whole or part of the report to a number of Commonwealth authorities, including the CDPP. Importantly, s 27(1) provides that if a report is prepared under s 17 as a result of an examination, the record of the examination must accompany the report. To the extent that the primary judge held that s 18(1)(c) did not require the transcript to be included with the report, her Honour, with respect, failed to have regard to the express requirements in s 27(1). However, unless directed by the Minister, there is no obligation to prepare a report and ASIC is not bound by s 18 to give a copy of the report to the CDPP.
	
	
	Section 49 of the ASIC Act makes it clear that ASIC has a prosecutorial role as well as an investigative role. It is clear and not disputed that ASIC may take the record of the examination into account in considering whether a person has committed an offence and, in these circumstances, may cause a prosecution to be commenced and carried on.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted that ASIC officers could make use of the transcript for making an informed decision as to whether or not to charge the examinee and institute proceedings. It is not clear, with respect, whether the primary judge was of the opinion that the transcript could be made available to the CDPP for such a limited purpose. However, the respondent accepted, correctly in my opinion, that it could be. This is consistent with the power conferred on ASIC in the case of a serious contravention of a law of the Commonwealth to supply a copy of the report, under s 18(2)(c), which is required to include a record of the examination, by virtue of s 27. This is also consistent with ASIC’s functions in commencing or carrying on a prosecution. It is also consistent with the CDPP’s powers under s 6(1) of the DPP Act to take over the prosecution and its power under reg 3(1)(f) of the DPP Regulations to give advice to ASIC concerning the charges.
	
	
	There remains however the question of whether the use of the record of the examination is limited to making an informed decision on whether to lay charges or whether use could be made of the record in the subsequent conduct of the prosecution. Viewed in isolation, I do not think that s 49, coupled with the powers vested in ASIC in Div 2 of Pt 3 (ss 19-27) of the ASIC Act, necessarily implies that the latter is the case. The Act is silent as to the use that the CDPP can make of the material and limiting its use to the consideration of laying and formulation of charges does not render it inoperative or meaningless. Although such a limitation would doubtless cause some inconvenience and difficulty to prosecuting authorities, as I have pointed out, it is not enough that the implication may seem desirable.
	
	
	However, the Act also expressly contemplates that evidential use may be made of the examination. It is necessary to consider whether these provisions necessarily imply that the transcript of the examination can be made available to the prosecutor for the purpose of carrying out the prosecution.
	
	
	Section 76 expressly provides that a statement made in an examination is admissible in evidence against a person in a proceeding unless, relevantly, it is not admissible because of s 68(3) of the ASIC Act.
	
	
	Section 68 obliges examinees to answer questions at a s 19 examination, notwithstanding that they might tend to incriminate the examinee. However, s 68(3) preserves direct use immunity if the conditions in s 68(2) are satisfied. The first condition in s 68(2) is that a claim for privilege is made before making the statement or signing the record. The second is that the statement or the signing of the record might in fact tend to incriminate the examinee.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted, correctly in my opinion, that the time for determining whether these conditions are satisfied is at the time the statement or the record is sought to be tendered in evidence. However, she concluded that s 76(1)(a) is only available when the falsity of the statement made in the s 19 examination is an element of the offence. The primary judge, in reaching that conclusion, relied in particular on what was said in Smith at [72]-[74] and [86]-[88].
	
	
	In my opinion, s 76(1)(a) of the ASIC Act cannot be confined in the manner suggested by the primary judge. Relevantly, s 76(1)(a) makes statements at an examination admissible unless s 68(3) applies. It is a precondition to s 68(3) both that privilege was claimed in respect to the statement at the examination and that the statement tends to incriminate. Unless both of these preconditions apply, s 68(3) has no operation.
	
	
	Section 68(3)(c) and (d) operate as exceptions to the exclusionary provisions in s 68(3)(a) and (b). In proceedings in respect of the falsity of a statement, the statement is admissible irrespective of whether privilege is claimed at the examination and whether or not the statement may be self-incriminating.
	
	
	In these circumstances, s 76(1)(a) does not have the limited effect found by her Honour. In proceedings other than for the falsity of the statement, the statement will be admissible unless the preconditions in s 68(2) are satisfied, in which case s 68(3) operates to exclude the statement. In proceedings for the falsity of the statement, the statement will be admissible irrespective of whether the preconditions in s 68(2) are made out.
	
	
	I do not consider that the decision of the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Smith is authority to the contrary. Smith involved an appeal from a decision of the primary judge not to order separate trials and that charges brought under s 64(1) and (2) of the ASIC Act concerning the falsity of statements made in the examination be severed from the indictment.
	
	
	In Smith, it was submitted by the Crown that in proceedings not relating to the falsity of statements made in an examination, any such false statements made in the examination may be admissible as lies evidencing consciousness of guilt. That proposition was rejected. The principal judgment was delivered by Buss JA, Pullin JA agreeing.
	
	
	Paragraphs [72] and [74] of the judgment of Buss JA in Smith, cited by the trial judge in the Trial Judgment at [76], were under the heading “Ground 2: the proper construction of s 68(3) of the ASIC Act”: Smith at 226. In par [74] of his judgment, Buss JA stated, consistently with the construction to which I have referred above, that a statement is not admissible under s 68(3) if the preconditions in s 68(2)(a) and (b) are satisfied. He then, correctly, with respect, pointed out that the general prohibition is subject to an exception in proceedings in respect of the falsity of the statement.
	
	
	The remaining paragraphs of the judgment of Buss JA in Smith cited by her Honour (pars [86]-[88]) were directed to the question of whether the general prohibition in s 68(3) precluded the statement from being received in evidence in proceedings where falsity is not an issue “for the purpose of establishing that the statement was a lie told out of a consciousness of guilt”. In these paragraphs, his Honour was not considering the admissibility of statements when the preconditions to the operation of s 68(3) contained in s 68(2)(a)-(b) were not satisfied.
	
	
	Once it is accepted that statements made during a s 19 examination are admissible in criminal proceedings, unless the two preconditions in s 68(2) are met and that the time for determining whether these conditions are satisfied is at the time the statements are sought to be tendered in evidence, it follows, as a matter of necessary implication, that the CDPP officers responsible for the conduct of the proceedings are entitled to have access to the examination transcripts, not only to formulate charges, but to prosecute them. This access would enable CDPP officers to consider whether the privilege was properly claimed on any answer and whether the transcript could be tendered. Her Honour, with respect, erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.
	
	
	The alternative construction propounded by the respondent (see par [90] above), suggesting that it was not necessarily implicit that the CDPP was entitled to have access to the transcript, as a separate “voir dire team” could be engaged by the prosecution, derives no support from the terms of the legislation. Rather, the ASIC Act, particularly s 49, in conjunction with ss 68, 76 and 77, in my view, discloses, by necessary intendment, that if a prosecution is caused to be commenced or carried out by ASIC, the prosecutors may be given access to the transcript of a s 19 examination and, subject only to the prohibition against the direct use of self-incriminating material in s 68, can use it for the purpose of the prosecution.
	
	
	I have dealt with the matter thus far without reference to the purpose and object of the provisions in the ASIC Act. It is evident from the functions of ASIC, to which I have referred in pars [11] and [12] above, that it is entrusted with the supervision and regulation of corporate activity, including the enforcement of legislation relating to corporations. The comments of Windeyer J in Rees v Kratzman and those of Barwick CJ, Kitto J and Walsh J in Mortimer v Brown, to which I have referred in pars [45]-[48] above, are as applicable today as when they were made. In Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56; 178 CLR 408, a case dealing with the provision of a s 19 examination transcript to a Royal Commission, Brennan J made the following remarks as to the use that can be made of such transcript at 424-425:
	


“A person who obtains information in exercise of the powers conferred by s.19 of the Act comes under a statutory duty of confidence with respect to the information thus obtained. It is therefore important to ascertain the purposes for which such information can be legitimately used or disclosed. In the first place, the power conferred by s.19 of the Act to require a person to appear for examination and to answer questions is conferred for the purpose of obtaining ‘information relevant to a matter that (the A.S.C.) is investigating, or is to investigate, under Division 1’ of Pt 3 of the Act. So the information acquired by conducting a s.19 examination may be used for the purposes of such an investigation. In addition, s.127(3) authorizes disclosure of otherwise confidential information by, inter alia, the members and staff members of the A.S.C. for the purposes of performing the official functions of the person making the disclosure. As investigations are but some of the functions of the A.S.C. (most of which are prescribed by Pt 2 of the Act) the Act contemplates that information acquired on examinations under s.19 may be used and disclosed for the purpose of the performance or exercise of any of the functions of the A.S.C. Then, certain purposes other than the performance of the functions of the A.S.C. are approved by sub-ss.(2) and (4) of s.127. Information obtained in exercise of the powers conferred by s.19 may therefore be used or disclosed for the purpose of the performance of any of the functions of the A.S.C. and for any of the purposes mentioned in sub-ss.(2) and (4) of s.127. But for no other purpose.”


	
	One of the functions of ASIC is to cause a prosecution for a contravention of corporations law to be commenced and carried on. Making the transcript available to the person who has the responsibility to carry out such a prosecution is consistent with such functions.
	
	
	The historical analysis to which I have referred above also supports the conclusion which I have reached. As has been pointed out in a number of cases, the legislature has, for many years made “special exceptions to the otherwise accusatorial process of the criminal law in respect of bankruptcy and companies examinations”: X7 at [140]; see also Lee (No 1) at [317]. The legislative history to which I have referred also shows that this was not confined to examinations by courts. As the Solicitor-General pointed out (see par [73] above), there has been, since 1847, a “second stream of executive inquiry under compulsion without court supervision”. At least since the Companies Act 1874 (NSW), that executive inquiry did not solely relate to matters of bankruptcy and insolvency, but extended to inquiries in respect of fraud, misfeasance and breach of duty in relation to corporations. The legislation provided for the tender of a “report”, or non-self-incriminating answers, into evidence (see e.g. s 93 of the Companies Act 1874 (NSW), s 171(7) of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW)). Since the Companies Act 1961 (NSW), provision has been made for the introduction of statements made at examinations into evidence, with consideration given to whether and to what extent the privilege against self-incrimination should be abrogated. The legislative history shows that, irrespective of the availability of court supervision, it was intended that use could be made of the transcript in court proceedings, subject to such protection against self-incrimination conferred by the legislature.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the trial judge erred in law in the exercise of her discretion. Once it is established, as a matter of construction, that the prosecution was entitled to the transcript of the examination, there was no basis on which a “residual discretion” could be exercised to effectively deprive the prosecution of the transcript. The appeal should be allowed and the stay granted by her Honour set aside.
	
	
	I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The stay ordered by the primary judge on 10 October 2014 be set aside.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

Introduction


	
	Annette Greer, the plaintiff, claims damages against Garry Pickering, the second defendant, for alleged breach of retainer and negligence arising from his preparation of a contract for purchase of, and a residential tenancy agreement in respect of, a strata title townhouse and garage in Greenfield Park, New South Wales (the Property). Initially, the plaintiff claimed an order for possession of the Property against the occupier, Brian Beresford (the first defendant), but her claim was resolved by consent orders made on 22 December 2014. Accordingly Mr Pickering was the only active defendant in these proceedings.
	


Facts

The proposed purchase of the Property


	
	In early August 2009 Christopher Wright, the plaintiff’s husband, told her that he had been speaking to consultant at work, Jeff Gilbert, who had mentioned that he had a friend, Mr Beresford, who wanted to sell the Property at a reduced price. The reason given for the proposed sale was that Mr Beresford, the owner, who was not expected to live long due to a medical condition, owed significant sums to the Australian Taxation Office and wanted to ensure that he could live in the Property until he died. The proposal was that he would sell the Property at a discount in return for the promise that he would be entitled to reside there until his death.
	
	
	On 5 August 2009 the plaintiff and her husband visited the Property with a view to her deciding whether to agree to buy it on the terms proposed by Mr Beresford. The plaintiff assessed the Property to be in generally good repair although she noted that the vegetation in the garden was overgrown and the kitchen and bathroom were dated. She also checked the water supply and noted that the water from the taps ran clear. Mr Beresford who told them that his doctors had predicted that he had a maximum of six months to live as he had a kidney infection. He offered to sell the Property, which he asserted was worth $300,000, for $150,000.
	
	
	The plaintiff, who had experience as a tenant but not as a landlord, told Mr Beresford that she was only interested if there was a tenancy agreement. She said that such an agreement ought also include a provision that if Mr Beresford left the Property for six months, the tenancy would be at an end. She also suggested that there would need to be a provision that he would be required to give one month’s notice if he decided to return to his family in the United Kingdom. The plaintiff also proposed that the agreement provide “the normal tenant/ landlord rules”: that the landlord pay the council rates, strata fees, water connection fees, and that the tenant pay for gas, electricity and water. The plaintiff also told Mr Beresford that, if he did anything wrong, she wanted to be covered.
	
	
	During their conversation the plaintiff confirmed that if Mr Beresford breached any of the conditions of the tenancy agreement, she would have the right to evict him. He responded:
	


“I understand. I just want to live a quiet life. I won’t do anything to damage this property, this is my home. I just want to live here until I die, I have always looked after it. It’s a great deal for you. I will most likely be dead in a month or two and you get a cheap house. I just don’t want the Tax man to get it.”


	
	Mr Beresford also told the plaintiff that his solicitor was Ian Crichton-Browne and that Mr Gilbert had a power of attorney for him.
	
	
	Later that evening, Mr Wright typed up a document in which he set out the conditions that he and the plaintiff had discussed and agreed ought be included in her agreement with Mr Beresford. The document, which he sent by email to Mr Gilbert the following day, read as follows:
	


Conditions of Sale

[Address of Property] Greenfield Park NSW

Purchase Price    $150,000

Seller: Brian Beresford, [address of Property], Greenfield Park

Purchaser: Annette Greer, [address and phone number]

Settlement period: As soon as possible

Conditions of sale

1. Brian Beresford will be permitted to continue to live in the house with no rent payable until one of the following occurs

- His death

- He permanently vacates the premises

2. All other residents must vacate the house within 30 days if condition of sale no 1 occurs.

3. Brian must give 1 months [sic] notice if he intends to permanently vacate the premises.

4. If more than $10,000 of wilful damage is done to the property then this agreement ceases and the premises must be vacated.

5. Standard tenant/landlord rules apply (Owner to pay all council rates, strata fees and water connection fees, Brian to pay gas, electricity and water usage charges).

6. As agreed, the purchaser is to pay the legal costs of both parties.

This is my plain English version, if you want to put it into legal speak then no problems……Chris


	
	Mr Wright subsequently relayed to the plaintiff that Mr Gilbert had told him that Mr Beresford agreed to the conditions but wanted a deposit of $20,000 paid immediately. The plaintiff resisted immediate payment because she was concerned that Mr Beresford might back out, but Mr Wright told her that if that happened he would repay her himself and “cop the risk”.
	
	
	On 11 August 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne emailed a list of questions to Mr Gilbert who forwarded the email to the plaintiff, care of Mr Wright’s work email address. One of the questions was whether the purchaser had a solicitor. At about this time, Mr Wright suggested to the plaintiff that she retain a solicitor because of the seriousness of the transaction.
	
	
	The plaintiff found Mr Pickering’s name in the local telephone book and either she or Mr Wright contacted his office to enquire whether he could act for her and to find out how much he would charge.
	


Mr Pickering’s conveyancing practice


	
	In August 2009, Mr Pickering was the sole legal practitioner in a practice conducted from premises in Eastwood. His practice largely involved conveyancing but he also took instructions with respect to wills, probate and other matters. Since about 1995 he specialised in conveyancing and estimated that, by the time of the hearing, he had acted on approximately 19,000 conveyances. Mr Pickering was assisted by several experienced, non-legally trained paralegals including: Tania (who assisted generally with conveyancing); Josephine (who assisted with leases and litigation); Jeanette and Tammy (who assisted with settlements); and Linda (who assisted with wills, probate and litigation). Mr Pickering’s wife, Deborah, was responsible for the accounts, including the trust account.
	
	
	Mr Pickering did not generally see clients except where a prior appointment had been made in a work appointment diary which was kept for that purpose. He explained that he could not otherwise control his workload, which was considerable. Although he volunteered that he might be prepared to depart from that practice in the case of a long-standing client who actually had a contract, it was otherwise an invariable practice, the importance of which he repeatedly emphasised to his staff. Indeed when, on occasions, clients would drop in to Mr Pickering’s office, hoping to see him without an appointment, he reminded his staff that he would not see anyone who had not made an appointment.
	
	
	Mr Zahra, who appeared on behalf of Mr Pickering, tendered copies of the pages of Mr Pickering’s work appointment diary for 11 August 2009 to 18 August 2009 inclusive. Mr Pickering’s work appointment diary recorded that, at 6.30pm on 11 August 2009 he had an appointment at 6.30pm with a named client (who was not the plaintiff) concerning mortgage documents.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s appointment diary recorded that on 12 August 2009 he had an appointment at 10am with a named client (not the plaintiff) concerning a will. He had another appointment at 11.30am with another named client.
	
	
	On 12 August 2009 at 3.24pm Tania sent a quotation to the plaintiff by email attaching an estimate of fees. Thereafter she assisted Mr Pickering with the plaintiff’s transaction.
	
	
	On 12 August 2009 at 3.30pm Mr Wright responded to the questions in Mr Crichton-Browne’s email and set out Mr Pickering’s details. Mr Wright responded to Tania by email sent at 3.34pm in which he said:
	


“Tania, I have passed your details to the sellers [sic] solicitor. The property is at [address], Greenfield Park. The purchaser is Annette Greer, [address]. You should be hearing from them soon (we are both anxious to settle as soon as possible). If there are any questions please let me know . . . . . Chris.”

Whether there was another conference before the conference on 18 August 2009


	
	The plaintiff and her husband gave evidence that the meeting that occurred at Mr Pickering’s office on 18 August 2009 was the second of such meetings, the first having occurred, at most, a week before, on about 12 August 2009. The plaintiff deposed that she had rung Mr Pickering’s office and made an appointment to see him on 12 August 2009. The plaintiff and Mr Wright both deposed that they had first gone to Mr Pickering’s office after Mr Wright had finished work, when it was dusk but not dark, and had spoken with Mr Pickering, given him the document Mr Wright had typed entitled “Conditions of Sale” and instructed him to make sure that those clauses were included in the contract for sale. They also gave evidence that Mr Pickering had given them assurances that the plaintiff would be “totally protected”.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s evidence was that no such meeting with him occurred. I accept his evidence in the following exchange in cross-examination:
	


Q. . . . Isn't it possible that in fact Mr and Ms Greer made an on‑the‑run ad hoc appointment to see you?

A. They wouldn't have got to see me.

Q. Wouldn't have got to see you?

A. I don't see people without an appointment, unless they're really old clients and I'm handling the matter. I don't see clients without an appointment. I'm sorry.

Q. Nevertheless, an appointment can be arranged very quickly?

A. No, it can't, not when I'm seeing clients.

Q. I see. So you just don't accept that it's possible that Ms Greer rang up; this email exchange went on on the day of the 12th?

A. Did not happen.


	
	Mr Pickering was adamant in the following evidence, which I accept:
	


“If they've got a contract and they're on the way to an agent and they want me to go through it, yes, maybe. Maybe. But anyone else just coming in off the street when there's no contract, no. Sorry, does not happen. Does not happen and the reason being is because of the volume of work that I have. I just cannot possibly accommodate everyone.”


	
	Mr Pickering did, however, accept that the plaintiff and her husband might have come to his office and seen one of the staff on a date earlier than 18 August 2009. Mr Pickering’s work appointment diary established that the only appointment for the plaintiff was at 7pm on 18 August 2009. Moreover, Mr Pickering gave evidence that the draft contract, which was sent under cover of letter dated 14 August 2009 (see below), did not arrive until Monday 17 August 2009 or Tuesday 18 August 2009. It was not his usual practice to see a client more than once, or to see a client without access to the contract documents.
	
	
	I do not accept the evidence of the plaintiff and her husband that there was a meeting with Mr Pickering before the meeting on 18 August 2009. The reasons for my preference for Mr Pickering’s version are addressed below when I address the credibility of witnesses.
	


The period between 12 August 2009 and 18 August 2009


	
	On 12 August 2009 appointments were recorded in Mr Pickering’s diary with named clients (none of whom was the plaintiff) at 5pm, 6 pm and 6.30pm. The entry for the appointment at 6pm indicated that its purpose was to discuss complex loan documents; the appointment at 6.30pm was to discuss a sale contract.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s diary recorded the appointments for Thursday 13 August 2009 at 9.30am; 5pm; 6pm; 7pm and 7.30pm. There was also a note that a named person would drop in between 3pm-5pm to sign an affidavit of service.
	
	
	On Friday 14 August 2009, or Monday 17 August 2009, Mr Pickering received a letter from Mr Crichton-Browne which attached a duplicate contract. The letter said in part:
	


“We are the solicitors for the vendor and understand that you are acting for the purchaser.

We attach duplicate Contract for approval and if approved for execution by your client and subsequent exchange provided that on or before exchange we receive duly completed Section 66W Certificate and the 10% deposit.”


	
	I note that, of the six conditions listed in the Conditions of Sale document, five were included in the draft contract. Only the fourth, which related to wilful damage in excess of $10,000, was excluded. I infer that Mr Crichton-Browne, who had received the Conditions of Sale document, had either been instructed by his client not to include it or had advised his client that he ought not agree to its inclusion. In these circumstances I am not prepared to infer that, had the plaintiff insisted on its inclusion in the contract for sale, Mr Beresford would have been prepared to proceed with the sale to the plaintiff, even though he subsequently agreed to a wider clause in the tenancy agreement.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s diary recorded appointments with named clients (none of whom was the plaintiff) on Friday 14 August 2009 at 2pm; 3.30pm; and 4.30pm.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s diary recorded the appointments with named clients (none of whom was the plaintiff) on Saturday 15 August 2009 at 9am; 10am; 10.30am; 11am; midday; 12.30pm; 1pm; 2pm; 3pm and 4pm. There was a vertical line drawn below 4pm, which I infer signified that it was expected to be a long appointment and the last one for the day.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s appointment diary was blank for Sunday 16 August 2009. The appointment diary recorded the appointments for Monday 17 August 2009 with named clients (none of whom was the plaintiff) at 11am; 12.30pm; 1pm; 5pm; 6pm; and 7pm.
	
	
	On 18 August 2009 Mr Pickering received a sewerage diagram in respect of the Property under cover of a “with compliments” slip from Mr Crichton-Browne.
	
	
	Mr Pickering’s diary recorded appointments for Tuesday 18 August 2009 with named clients (none of whom was the plaintiff) at 3pm; 3.30pm; 5pm and 6pm. The diary recorded an appointment at 7pm with the plaintiff. The entry read “Greer P”, which I understood to mean that the client was the purchaser in a conveyancing transaction.
	


The conference on 18 August 2009 at Mr Pickering’s office


	
	Both the plaintiff and Mr Wright came to Mr Pickering’s office for the plaintiff’s appointment at 7pm on 18 August 2009. As referred to above, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff met Mr Pickering on any other occasion in 2009.
	
	
	The plaintiff told Mr Pickering that Mr Beresford had a serious medical condition and was not expected to live much longer and that she had agreed to buy the Property and allow him to live there rent-free for the rest of his life. Notwithstanding Mr Pickering’s advice against entering into the transaction, because of the uncertainty about how long Mr Beresford would live, the plaintiff confirmed her desire to proceed with the transaction.
	
	
	Mr Pickering went through the contract of sale with the plaintiff. The contract included the following special conditions:
	


1.1   (a) In consideration of the purchaser paying to the vendor the purchase price the purchaser agrees to the vendor remaining in possession of the property subsequent to completion until the earlier of the following:

(i)   the demise of the vendor; or

(ii)   the vendor permanently vacating the property.

(b) Whilst the vendor remains in the property the purchaser will pay all municipal rates, water rates, and strata levies including special levies relating to the property.

(c) During the period of his occupation the vendor will pay all utility charges including gas, electricity and water usage.

1.2   In the event of the vendor vacating the property pursuant to sub-clause 1 the vendor must ensure that all other occupants of the property vacate same at the same time.

1.3   Should the vendor wish to vacate the premises the vendor shall give to the purchaser one month’s notice of his intention to do so.

…

1.5   It is hereby agreed that this clause constitutes a caveatable interest in the property on behalf of the vendor.


	
	During this conference the plaintiff told Mr Pickering that her middle name was Queeta and requested that it be inserted in the contract. The plaintiff also advised Mr Pickering that the deposit was to be $20,000, rather than $15,000 (being 10% of the purchase price of $150,000), which was the figure that appeared on the draft contract. Mr Pickering advised the plaintiff not to agree to special condition 8(g) (which provided that cl. 16.8 was deleted) and advised her to seek reinstatement of cl 16.8 (which related to payment for settlement cheques). Mr Pickering also pointed out special condition 12 of the draft contract which provided that the plaintiff was obliged to pay Mr Beresford’s legal costs.
	
	
	The plaintiff acknowledged in cross-examination that she left it to Mr Pickering to properly document the transaction in the way that he considered to be most appropriate.
	
	
	The following exchange occurred concerning payment of the deposit:
	


Plaintiff:   I want to pay a deposit of $20,000 directly to the vendor, with $10,000 to be immediately available for him to use. If for some reason the contract does not proceed then he will have to return that money.

Mr Pickering:   I don’t think that is a good idea because you have no certainty of ever getting your money back. Normally the deposit only gets released on completion.

Plaintiff:   I know that, but I want to do it anyway.


	
	Mr Pickering made the changes they discussed in handwriting on the draft contract. The plaintiff then signed the front page of the contract.
	
	
	According to the plaintiff and Mr Wright, the plaintiff noted that the clause that was listed in the document entitled “Conditions of Sale” (which Mr Wright had typed up and provided to Mr Crichton-Browne) relating to damage in excess of $10,000 did not appear in the draft contract and raised its omission with Mr Pickering at the conference. I do not accept this evidence. I regard it as founded on a reconstruction of events based on their belief (which I regard as mistaken) that they gave Mr Pickering the Conditions of Sale document at an earlier conference on or about 12 August 2009.
	
	
	In my view, the more likely explanation is that they gave the Conditions of Sale document to Mr Gilbert and did not appreciate until much later that, although Mr Crichton-Browne had included some of the terms set out in the Conditions of Sale document in the sale contract, he had not included the one concerning damage above $10,000. It follows that I do not accept the evidence of the plaintiff or Mr Wright that that Mr Pickering apologised to the plaintiff for not including the clause in the draft contract (which was, in any event, prepared by Mr Crichton-Browne, as the vendor’s solicitor) or that Mr Pickering blamed Tania for not noticing its absence. I accept Mr Pickering’s evidence that there was no mention in the course of the conference on 18 August 2009 of a clause being included in the sale contract relating to damage to the Property and that the topic of damage to the Property was not raised at all. I do not accept the plaintiff’s evidence that she noted that the damage clause had not been included in the sale contract.
	
	
	I accept that it is likely that Mr Pickering, in accordance with his usual practice, asked the plaintiff to supply details of her mortgage broker so that he could send the front page of the contract and a title search to such a person on exchange to facilitate the procurement of finance.
	
	
	In the course of the conference Mr Pickering advised the plaintiff of the need to have a lease arrangement to cover Mr Beresford’s right to reside on the Property.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr Pickering asked the plaintiff whether she was happy for him to exchange contracts if Mr Beresford agreed to the changes proposed on the draft contract. The plaintiff responded, “Yes”. I do not accept that the plaintiff was ever advised of any need to return to Mr Pickering’s office to sign the contract again once it was retyped to include the changes he suggested. I accept that the plaintiff signed the contract on 18 August 2009 and gave Mr Pickering instructions to exchange contracts on the basis of what she had signed.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Pickering in cross-examination that he should have obtained the plaintiff’s signature on each page of the contract and her initials beside each of the handwritten amendments to the draft contract forwarded by Mr Crichton-Browne. Mr Pickering responded that such a process did not accord with his practice, which was to take instructions from the client and have the client sign the front page, but otherwise to deal with the vendor’s solicitor, who would be responsible for exchange after all agreed amendments had been made to the final version.
	
	
	There was no evidence to the effect that there was anything untoward about Mr Pickering’s practice or that it was not the usual practice of those solicitors who practised generally in conveyancing. Moreover, Mr Pickering took exception to the insinuation that there was anything wrong with it and intimated that one was entitled to trust another solicitor to prepare a document in accordance with the communications between solicitors as to the agreed terms of a contract. I reject the submission of Ms McDonald, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, that Mr Pickering’s practice in this regard reflected adversely either on his competence or his diligence.
	


The email of 19 August 2009


	
	On Wednesday 19 August 2009 at 7.38am Mr Wright sent an email from his work email address (which was also used by the plaintiff) to Tania:
	


“Tania, we met with Garry last night about our purchase of [the Property] (In the name of Annette Greer). He asked us to pass on our mortgage broker’s information. Please find these details below.

There was also two other items that were mentioned. One was that we will be paying $20k direct to the vendor as a deposit, Garry said that he will make sure that this is in the contract. The other is a condition of sale that both parties agreed on but was not in the sale contract (this needs to be added). There are currently two conditions which would end the vendor’s right to stay in the property after settlement (either his death, or permenantly [sic] vacating the premesis [sic], we also agreed on a third condition “If there is more than $10,000 malicious damege [sic] done to the property.” Can this third condition be addressed[?]

If there are any questions please let us know……Annette Greer, [mobile phone number supplied]

	The plaintiff’s counsel relied on the email to corroborate the plaintiff’s and Mr Wright’s evidence that they had instructed Mr Pickering to include a clause that Mr Beresford would have to vacate the premises if he did more than $10,000 of malicious damage to the Property. I do not read the email as necessarily asserting that such instructions were given. Mr Zahra argued that the email, fairly read, indicated that the plaintiff was informing Tania that she and Mr Beresford had agreed to such a condition and that she wanted the condition to be “addressed”, in the sense of considered, by Mr Pickering.
	
	
	I am not satisfied, for the reasons given above, that the plaintiff instructed Mr Pickering on or at any time prior to 18 August 2009 to include a clause in the contract for sale of the Property that damage (whether wilful, malicious or otherwise) in excess of $10,000 would give her a right to terminate the right to possession conferred on Mr Beresford by that contract. However, her email to Tania dated 19 August 2009 did, in my view, constitute such an instruction because of her wording “this needs to be added”. Although a subsequent sentence “Can this third condition be addressed?” qualified that instruction, I consider that Mr Pickering was obliged, in light of the terms of the email, to address the question whether such a clause ought be inserted into the sale contract.
	
	
	In support of her submission that Mr Pickering saw the email, Ms McDonald relied on the fact that the email contained the mortgage broker’s contact details and that a facsimile of the front page of the contract was sent to the mortgage broker to the number supplied in the facsimile. There is a number of possibilities to account for this: first, Tania may have obtained the mortgage broker’s number an earlier telephone communication with the plaintiff; or secondly, she might have seen the email and taken the mortgage broker’s contact details from it and used them in the letter she prepared which was signed by Mr Pickering and sent to the mortgage broker on 21 August 2009, which is referred to below.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that Mr Pickering saw a copy of this email prior to the commencement of these proceedings. Although the plaintiff had given him instructions to exchange contracts if the changes suggested had been made, it was open to her to change those instructions before exchange had been effected. Nonetheless, since the plaintiff had instructed Mr Pickering to exchange contracts if Mr Beresford agreed to the changes proposed, I consider that she ought to have rung Mr Pickering direct, rather than send an email to Tania, if she had wanted exchange to be deferred pending consideration of the matters she had raised. This was particularly so since the plaintiff and Mr Wright had impressed on Mr Pickering the urgency of the transaction and their desire to have it finalised as soon as possible because of their belief that Mr Beresford’s death was imminent.
	
	
	I accept Mr Pickering’s evidence that, had he seen the email, he would not have altered the contract for sale to include a special condition because he would not have considered that the condition advanced the plaintiff’s rights. Furthermore because he was asked (in the email) to “address” the question, he was entitled to use his professional judgment to decide whether to include the term in the contract for sale, notwithstanding his client’s view that it should be “added” to the contract. Indeed, the plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that she relied on Mr Pickering to use his professional judgment in such matters. I accept Mr Pickering’s evidence that he would, had he seen the clause, regarded it as superfluous and potentially undesirable since the plaintiff had an implied right to terminate the tenancy (pursuant to s 84(1)(b) of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)) if Mr Beresford damaged the Property, whether wilfully, maliciously or otherwise.
	


The period between the conference on 18 August 2009 and exchange of contracts


	
	On 20 August 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne rang Mr Pickering’s firm and spoke to one of the paralegals, in all likelihood Tania, to find out how the plaintiff’s matter was going. On the same day, Mr Pickering sent a letter to Mr Crichton-Browne in which he set out his instructions as to the proposed amendments to the contract: the addition of the plaintiff’s middle name; the deletion of special condition 8(g); the reinstatement of special condition 16.8; the amendment of the deposit amount from $15,000 to $20,000; and the insertion of a further special condition as follows:
	


“14   The purchaser shall pay a deposit of $20,000.00. Of that amount $10,000.00 shall be immediately released to the purchaser for his own use absolutely. Should for whatever reason the contract not settle, then that money shall remain a debt to the purchaser and shall be returned immediately to the purchaser by the vendor on termination of the contract.”


	
	By facsimile sent on 21 August 2009, Mr Crichton-Browne wrote to Mr Pickering and informed him that he had made the changes referred to in the letter of 20 August 2009, save that the word “purchaser” in the second line of cl 14 ought be changed to “vendor”. The facsimile concluded:
	


“We are now arranging for our client to attend this office to execute the original Contract with a view to effecting an exchange of Contracts.”


	
	By letter dated 21 August 2009 Mr Pickering wrote to Mr Crichton-Browne in the following terms:
	


“We enclose by way of exchange counterpart contract executed by the purchasers in the matter.

We would be pleased if you could date both the original and counterpart contracts and return the executed original contract to our office by return mail.”


	
	I accept Mr Pickering’s evidence that he relied on his instructions obtained on 18 August 2009 to exchange contracts. He was satisfied by the facsimile sent by Mr Crichton-Browne that he could exchange on that basis as all the changes proposed on behalf of the plaintiff had been accepted by Mr Beresford.
	
	
	On 21 August 2009 Mr Pickering also wrote to John Spry, the plaintiff’s mortgage broker, and attached a copy of the front page of the contract.
	
	
	On Monday 24 August 2009 Mr Pickering signed a certificate pursuant to s 66W of the Conveyancing Act, which had the effect of waiving the cooling-off period in relation to the contract. On the same day he received a facsimile from Mr Crichton-Browne who noted that the $20,000 deposit had been received by Mr Beresford. Mr Crichton-Browne sought an executed contract and a s 66W certificate so that exchange could be effected. He also reminded Mr Pickering of special condition 12, which provided that the plaintiff was liable for Mr Beresford’s reasonable legal costs and foreshadowed that he would send a tax invoice to him. I infer that the tax invoice was passed onto the plaintiff for payment as provided for by special condition 12 of the contract for sale.
	


Exchange of contracts on 25 August 2009


	
	By letter dated 25 August 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne wrote to Mr Pickering, referred to his letter of 21 August 2009 and advised that contracts had been exchanged.
	


Between exchange and settlement


	
	On 27 August 2009, shortly after Mr Spry called her to say that her loan had been approved, the plaintiff telephoned Mr Pickering’s office and left a message to say that she wanted to exchange contracts. I infer that she was unaware at that stage that exchange had already been effected on 25 August 2009. On 28 August 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne sent an executed transfer and a tax invoice for his fees to Mr Pickering.
	
	
	On 31 August 2009 Mr Pickering wrote to the plaintiff confirming that exchange had been effected on 25 August 2009 and informed her that settlement would take place on 6 October 2009. Mr Pickering also wrote to Mr Crichton-Browne enclosing his firm’s standard requisitions on title and notices under s 118 of the Conveyancing Act.
	
	
	On 31 August 2009 at 12.32pm the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Pickering’s email address in the following terms:
	


“Hello Garry,

A couple of things to sort out with the Greenfield Park Property contract. I am still a little confused on why the exchange of contracts happened when neither Chris [n]or I contacted you for this to happen. Can you confirm why this happened?

I would also like the other $10,000 which is with Brian’s lawyer to be released to Brian immediately as we discussed at the meeting with you. I asked you to change the front page of the contract to state $20,000 to be released before Settlement (on exchange) and the other $130,000 to be paid once Settlement occurred. Can this please be done[?]

Can you also fax the front page of our exchanged contract to our Financial Advisor John Spry so he can pressure the bank to move quicker on confirming our loan. His fax number is: [supplied]

Over the weekend I discussed with Chris the Rental Agreement we would like drawn up between me and Brian. It will be a standard Rental Agreement with the following items added: (as per the original contract)

- If $10,000 of damage is caused to the house or property the tenancy agreement with Brian ceases.

- If Brian vacates the property permanently then the agreement is ended.

- If the house is unoccupied by Brian for a 12 month period the Owners may rent to a 3rd party but the Owners must keep the property available on the date stated by Brian on his return.

- Brian has no rent to pay for the period [he] resides at the house as per agreement during sale of property.

- Brian must remain the actual tenant of the property and not substitute another party.

Can you please put this into legal wording and pass onto Brian’s solicitors.

If you need any clarification on anything please call me anytime on [phone number] or you can reply to this email address.

Thank you.”


	
	The contents of this email revealed that the plaintiff was unaware of what the concept of “exchange” involved, although she was aware that it had occurred. The contents of the email do not establish that Mr Pickering exchanged without instructions since his usual practice did not require the plaintiff to attend again to sign a new version of the contract which had been engrossed with the amendments sought and which contained the additional special condition 14 which Mr Pickering had proposed on behalf of the plaintiff. I regard the contents of this email as constituting the plaintiff’s instructions as to clauses that ought be inserted into the proposed residential tenancy agreement.
	
	
	Once he had read the plaintiff’s email, Mr Pickering hand-wrote instructions to his staff on the printed copy of the email as to the preparation of a residential tenancy agreement.
	
	
	On or shortly prior to 11 September 2009 the plaintiff received an invoice for Mr Crichton-Browne’s fees. Apparently, she had forgotten that her agreement to pay those fees had been included in the contract as special condition 12. She rang Mr Pickering’s office and complained to Jeanette, who in turn informed Mr Pickering of her complaint. Mr Pickering wrote to the plaintiff and reminded her that he had taken her through the special conditions of the contract, including cl 12. He referred to Mr Crichton-Browne’s invoice, informed her that he did not regard the fee as reasonable and asked her whether she wanted him to take issue with the amount. The letter concluded:
	


“With respect to the preparation of the Rental Agreement, do you want me to prepare the Rental Agreement or are you wanting the solicitor acting for the vendor to prepare the Rental Agreement?”


	
	After the plaintiff received Mr Pickering’s letter of 11 September 2009 she rang Mr Pickering’s firm and spoke to Jeanette. The plaintiff apologised for her earlier complaint and explained that she had not been listening very carefully when Mr Pickering had taken her through the terms of the contract. She confirmed to Jeanette that she had agreed that the conditions of sale included a requirement that she pay Mr Beresford’s legal costs.
	
	
	On 29 September 2009 Jeanette wrote a memorandum to Mr Pickering which attached a standard form residential tenancy agreement. She requested that he dictate the note he had handwritten on the printed copy of the plaintiff’s email dated 31 August 2009 referred to above. By facsimile dated 1 October 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne sent a request to Mr Pickering for the rental agreement, which was to be delivered to Mr Beresford, as he was said to be too ill to attend Mr Crichton-Browne’s office to execute the agreement.
	
	
	On 2 October 2009 Mr Crichton-Browne informed Mr Pickering of settlement figures for 6 October 2009.
	
	
	On Monday 5 October 2009 Jeanette sent a copy of the draft residential tenancy agreement to the plaintiff for her approval. On the following morning, by email to Jeanette sent at 5.27am the plaintiff wrote:
	


“I have checked the Residential Tenancy Agreement and all is correct. . . “

Settlement day: 6 October 2009


	
	On 6 October 2009 the transaction settled. Following settlement there was no further contact between the plaintiff and Mr Pickering.
	


The Lease


	
	The plaintiff attended Mr Pickering’s office on 7 October 2009 and saw Tania. On that occasion she signed a residential tenancy agreement which was largely in the standard form (the Lease). It provided that rent of $1 for the duration of the term of the Lease was to be paid on 6 October 2009, being the commencement date. The Lease also provided:
	


“The term of this agreement is until such date as Mr Beresford permanently vacates the property or upon the date of his death.”


	
	The Lease provided that the tenant was not to use the premises for any illegal purpose (cl 8.1). The following additional terms were included:
	


Additional Terms

The Tenant agrees that:

(a)   Should he cause significant damage to the property, and to this end, significant is defined to be “damage defined to be requiring expenditure in excess of $10,000 to rectify, then the lease shall automatically end and the tenant shall in such event leave the premises immediately upon being notified by the Landlord and this lease shall be at an end.

(b)   Should the tenant vacate the property and remain absent for a period in excess of twelve (12) months then the Lease shall be regarded as having ended and the tenant shall permanently vacate the property upon being notified by the Landlord, and

(c)   Should the tenant leave the premises unoccupied for a period of twelve (12) months or less and notifies the landlord prior to commencing the period of absence and nominate to the landlord a return date, then the landlord shall have the right to lease the premises to a Third Party but shall ensure that any lease entered into with any third party shall not exceed the period of the tenant’s absence and shall ensure that the property will be available for immediate occupation by the tenant upon the tenant’s return.

(d)   The tenant shall have no right to sub-let the premises.


	
	Just before she executed the Lease, the plaintiff noticed that it contained a term that no more than one person could live on the Property at any one time. As the plaintiff recalled Mr Beresford saying that he wanted company, she deleted the clause and initialled the change. The plaintiff subsequently received from Mr Pickering a letter dated 7 November 2009 which enclosed two copies of the Lease, executed by herself and Mr Beresford.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought to cast aspersions on Mr Pickering’s competence and diligence (and therefore on his reliability and credibility) by asserting that the Lease should have been registered as it had a potential term of greater than three years. I do not regard this as a material matter. Mr Pickering was led to believe that Mr Beresford was at Death’s door. Further, although a legal lease for a term greater than three years can only be created by registration, an agreement for lease is still binding (as long as it is supported by consideration, as I have found this Lease was). Registration may have, in other contexts, have had consequences for the priority of Mr Beresford’s interest; however, it was not required to protect the plaintiff’s interest, since she was the registered proprietor of the Property.
	


The breaches between 6 October 2009 and the end of 2012


	
	Mr Beresford breached the Lease from the time of its commencement. The plaintiff received regular communications from the Owners Corporation for the Property requesting that she undertake work or remediate some nuisance or other that he had either caused, or permitted to occur.
	
	
	On 2 November 2009 the plaintiff received minutes of a meeting of the Owners Corporation in which she was requested, as owner of the Property, to remove or control “out of control” dogs and replace a damaged fence. She rang Mr Beresford who responded:
	


“The dogs are not mine. I can’t control them. They belong to my house guests. They are not my responsibility.”


	
	On 6 November 2009 the plaintiff received a letter from the Owners Corporation which said in part:
	


“It appears that there are dogs within your lot that you have no control over. The dogs are wandering the common property and attacking other residents and in that respect you are asked to remove them immediately. You are also asked to clean up around the area and replace the damaged fence at the rear of the property which has been vandalised from someone within [the Property].”


	
	On occasion Mr Wright heard news about Mr Beresford from Mr Gilbert, including that Mr Beresford was spending time in gaol and that several people were living on the Property. Mr Wright relayed these alarming snippets to the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff inspected the Property on various occasions. She observed that Mr Beresford allowed the vegetation to become overgrown. In about July 2010 she received a notice of a proposed order from Fairfield Council giving her 14 days to clear overgrowth on the Property because of a concern that it might become a haven for vermin.
	
	
	On 12 December 2011 the plaintiff telephoned Fairfield Council and the strata manager for the Property to inform them that she proposed to remove all the growth from the Property and repair the broken windows.
	
	
	The condition of the property was degraded by damage to the fence, deck, windows and door. The plaintiff visited the Property on 3 February 2012 to obtain a quotation for replacement of the windows. She noted the following on a condition report:
	


“Visited 03-Feb-2012 to get window replacement quote & place smelt. Yard was totally overgrown – grass up to knees.

5 windows needed replacing – did not go inside. Backyard smelt – not rubbish but damp & rotting wood etc. Very very unpleasant.

Left letter in letterbox warning that state of property must change.”


	
	On 12 February 2012 the plaintiff arranged for the overgrown vegetation to be removed and the broken windows to be replaced at a total cost of $8,900. On 1 March 2012 she arranged for the back fence to be repaired at a cost of $1,750. This payment brought the total she had spent by reason of damage done to the Property to more than $10,000.
	
	
	Mr Beresford also breached the Lease by failing to pay some of the water bills. The plaintiff attended to payment of these bills.
	
	
	In March 2012, notwithstanding the following, the plaintiff decided that she would not move to evict Mr Beresford from the Property:
	



	
	More than $10,000 damage had been done;
	
	
	He had failed to keep overgrown vegetation under control;
	
	
	He had caused, or permitted, damage to the Property (broken windows, rotting deck, damaged fence etc.);
	
	
	His actions and inactions had led to letters being sent to the plaintiff from the Council and the Owners Corporation requiring her to carry out works.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that she felt sympathy for Mr Beresford because he was dying. She may also have been influenced by her belief that time would solve the problem because she would be entitled to possession on his death. Her view as at March 2012 appears from the following exchange in her cross-examination:
	


Q. But what about the other problems. Mr Beresford had made all sorts of promises to you about keeping the property in good repair and had failed to live up to them. That's your evidence, isn't it?

A. The inside of the property had been kept in good repair. It was only the outside which was - he claimed constantly was through various people who resided with him at different times.

. . .

Q. Are you trying to justify Mr Beresford's conduct, are you?

A. No, I want to explain that this is someone's home, and to take the responsibility of kicking someone out of their home is something that I take very seriously.

Q. You felt sorry for him.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. But this was a clause that you said was very important for you to have in your arrangement with Mr Beresford, that if $10,000 damage was caused, you could evict him?

A. Yes. But to throw someone out of their home for $10,001 is, I think, heartless. You need to have something more than a bit of overgrown vegetation and some rubbish.

Q. You picked the number of $10,000 in your document, didn't you?

A. It was a point that we had to draw in the sand, yes.

Q. Was it important to you or not?

A. Yes, it was important.

The use of the Property as a drug laboratory


	
	On or before 17 November 2012 the New South Wales Police Force Drug Squad conducted a raid on the Property and discovered a clandestine drug laboratory. Numerous dangerous goods and chemicals were removed during a site inspection conducted by Police. The Property was also found to be contaminated with substances that were potentially harmful to health and safety.
	
	
	On or about 3 December 2012 the plaintiff was informed that the Police had raided the Property and arrested Mr Beresford and his associates in relation to drug-related activities alleged to have been conducted on the Property. A notice dated 7 December 2012 was served on her by Fairfield Council pursuant to s 124 of the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW) (the s 124 notice). The order made by the s 124 notice required the plaintiff to:
	


“Within THIRTY (30) DAYS of the date of this Order, ensure that the premises are placed in a safe or healthy condition by undertaking the following:

Engage the services of a suitably qualified Occupational Hygienist to undertake an assessment of the presence of any drug related substance residue from the drug manufacturing activities discovered on the premises.

This investigation shall include (but not be limited to) the land, drainage systems and pathways that may have been contaminated during the storage, handling, manufacturing, transportation or disposal of chemical and drug related substances.

Upon completion of the works a report shall be submitted to Fairfield City Council certifying that any clean-up works have been completed under the supervision of Occupational Hygienist.

Subsequently, a clearance certificate issued by a suitably qualified occupational hygienist shall be submitted to Fairfield City Council indicating that the subject premises is rendered in a safe and healthy condition for human occupation.”


	
	The plaintiff was also informed that non-compliance with the s 124 notice constituted an offence. The plaintiff agreed in cross-examination that from this time she knew that the Property was “highly toxic and unfit for human habitation”. At about this time the plaintiff made a claim on the landlord insurance she had taken out with Hubbard Insurance (formerly Real Insurance) with respect to the Property.
	


The plaintiff’s attempts to obtain possession: the CTTT proceedings


	
	On 12 December 2012 the plaintiff sent to Mr Beresford, by registered mail, a notice to terminate the Lease, relying on a breach of cl 8.1: namely that he had, in contravention of that clause, used or caused or permitted the Property to be used for an illegal purpose. The plaintiff prepared the notice after speaking with an unidentified person from the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT). She did not consult a solicitor for advice. Mr Beresford collected the letter on 17 December 2012 but refused to budge from the Property.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that if Mr Beresford had vacated the Property as required by the notice, she would have rented out the Property and would not have sued Mr Pickering.
	
	
	On 9 January 2013 the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the CTTT to have Mr Beresford evicted from the Property.
	
	
	On 25 January 2013 the plaintiff rang Detective Senior Constable Marshall of the Drug Squad to obtain a copy of the site inspection report prepared following the raid on the Property. She learned through speaking with him that Mr Beresford and two others had been arrested; that the drug laboratory was a medium size; that most of the drugs and chemicals were found in the garage, although chemicals and drug-related items were also found in the house; and that Police had spent all day clearing the Property. Detective Marshall confirmed that it would not have been possible for someone to live in the house and not know about the laboratory. Following this conversation the plaintiff obtained a copy of the site inspection report from the Fairfield Council. The report included the following warning:
	


Personal Protective Equipment 

The following is the minimum recommended Personal Protective Equipment to be worn when inspecting or remediating the premises:


	
		
			
			• Chemical resistant overalls
			
			
			• Safety glasses or goggles
			
		
		
			
			• Chemical resistant gloves
			
			
			• Construction helmet
			
		
		
			
			• Safety boots or shoes
			
			
			• P2 Dust mask
			
		
	



	
	On about 22 February 2013 the plaintiff arranged for Master Floor Care Pty Ltd (Master Floor Care) to clean up the Property as required by the s 124 notice.
	


The inspection of the Property on 25 February 2013


	
	Before she and Mr Wright went to the Property on 25 February 2013 to inspect it with Nalin Alwis of Master Floor Care, the plaintiff sent a text to Mr Beresford asking him to vacate the Property for a couple of hours during the inspection.
	
	
	When the plaintiff and her husband arrived at the Property she saw Mr Beresford and two other persons, Daniel and Paris (whom she recognised as the persons who had been arrested following the drug raid), in the garage, which was open, with a fourth person. The plaintiff and Mr Wright parked their car on the main road. While they were waiting for Mr Alwis she took photographs of the rear fence. When she returned to her car, she observed Daniel get into the back seat of another car. He formed the shape of a gun with his hand and motioned the action of firing at her. Daniel repeated the movement from inside the car. The plaintiff saw the car in which Daniel was a passenger, and which was occupied by two others, drive away.
	
	
	The plaintiff and Mr Wright went to the garage where they were approached by Mr Beresford, who had remained inside. He told them that they had no right to access the Property and provided them with the business card of Matthew Hazard, a solicitor from the Legal Aid Commission (Legal Aid). Mr Beresford withdrew inside the garage and closed the door. On this occasion the plaintiff took various photographs of the Property which show the exterior to be in a generally dilapidated condition.
	


The engagement of Marsdens in February 2013


	
	On the following day, 26 February 2013, the plaintiff engaged Marsdens, a law firm, to assist her to evict Mr Beresford.
	
	
	The plaintiff received a letter dated 4 March 2013 from the Registrar-General informing her that a caveat had been lodged on the title to the Property by Mr Beresford, whose signature had been witnessed by Mr Hazard. The nature of the estate or interest identified was said to be:
	


“The caveator is entitled to exclusive possession for his life or until he permanently vacates the land. The caveator’s interest is in the nature of a life estate.”


	
	The facts said to ground the interest were said to be:
	


“The caveator sold the land to the Registered Proprietor. For consideration (a sale price of less than half the land’s market value), the caveator retained a life tenancy under the contract. The caveator still uses and occupies the land.”


	
	The plaintiff withdrew her application in the CTTT on 8 March 2013 when she was informed by the CTTT that it did not have jurisdiction by reason of s 8(f) of the Residential Tenancy Act 2010 (NSW), which exempted from the Act an agreement for the sale of land that conferred a right to occupy residential premises on a party to the agreement.
	
	
	Master Floor Care retained Hibbs & Associates Pty Ltd (Hibbs) to inspect the property and assess the contamination. Hibbs, by report dated 16 April 2013, reported to Master Floor Care, which in turn reported to the plaintiff. The report disclosed that methylamphetamine had been found in high levels in 100% of the locations tested. Positive results were found in every room of the house and in the garage. Hibbs prepared a further report dated June 2013. In August 2013 Hibbs prepared a remediation action plan. In her affidavit of September 2014 the plaintiff said:
	


95.   Due to the current dispute with the defendant I have not yet attended to the remediation of the Property. According to the RAP [Remediation Action Plan] referred to in paragraph 93 above and exhibited to this affidavit, remediation of the Property requires the Property to be vacant for the duration of the remediation work. The defendant refuses to vacate the Property and refuses to allow access to the Property.

96.   The RAP also states that all soft furnishings from the residence should be disposed of as hazardous waste. As the soft furnishings are property of the defendant I am not entitled to dispose of them, and if the defendant does not voluntarily dispose of them, I am concerned that he will return the contaminated items to the Property after it has been remediated and will thereby re-contaminate the Property.


	
	It was not until six months after the plaintiff engaged her present solicitors, Marsdens, to help her evict Mr Beresford, that she instructed them to forward a further notice of termination to Mr Beresford on 28 August 2013. The evidence does not reveal the reason for the delay. When the plaintiff was asked in cross-examination what took them so long, she responded: “You would have to ask them”. Although Emma Macfarlane, the employed solicitor at Marsdens with carriage of the matter, deposed to the fees the firm had charged the plaintiff, she did not give any explanation of why the eviction of Mr Beresford from the Property progressed so slowly or why no application for urgent relief was ever made on the plaintiff’s behalf.
	
	
	The notice of termination dated 28 August 2013 relied on breaches, including a breach of the “additional term”, cl 6(a), which referred to damage requiring expenditure in excess of $10,000. The notice concluded:
	


“If you do not vacate the premises on or by 4 September 2013, my client initiate [sic] proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW to recover possession. Any such application will incur significant legal costs which my client will seek to recover from you.”


	
	Notwithstanding that proceedings for possession in this Court were foreshadowed, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Local Court on 30 October 2013 for possession of the Property and damages for breach of the Lease by statement of claim filed by Marsdens. The plaintiff explained in her evidence that she was advised to commence the proceedings in the Local Court rather than in this Court by reason of Part 4 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1899 (NSW) and a concern that Mr Beresford might have a defence to a claim in this Court by reason of s 2A of the Landlord and Tenant Act, which provides that a claim for ejectment cannot be made in this Court if, relevantly, the rent does not exceed twenty-five dollars and twenty cents per week.
	


The transfer of proceedings to this Court


	
	On 9 December 2013, Mr Beresford’s solicitor raised the issue of jurisdiction and filed a motion for transfer to this Court. Eventually, on 21 February 2014, the Local Court proceedings were transferred to this Court by consent, on the basis that Mr Beresford would not raise a defence based on s 2A of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
	
	
	At some time in about 2013 or 2014 the plaintiff and her husband visited Mr Pickering’s office on a Saturday to obtain a copy of his file with respect to the plaintiff’s purchase of the Property.
	
	
	By order made by this Court on 26 May 2014, leave was granted to the plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim which joined Mr Pickering as a defendant in these proceedings.
	
	
	On 13 August 2014 directions were made requiring Mr Beresford to serve his evidence by 29 October 2014. On 23 October 2014 Mr Beresford was admitted to Liverpool Hospital. No evidence had been filed on his behalf.
	
	
	By letter dated 24 November 2014 to Legal Aid, Marsdens foreshadowed an application to file a further amended statement of claim. For the first time, the plaintiff alleged that there was an implied term of the Lease by reason of s 84(1)(b) of the Conveyancing Act, breach of which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the Lease, regain possession and recover damages.
	
	
	The plaintiff sent to Mr Beresford a notice to remedy breach dated 3 December 2014 pursuant to s 129 of the Conveyancing Act in which she referred to the term implied by s 84(1)(b) of the Conveyancing Act; detailed the ways in which Mr Beresford was in breach; and required him to remedy the breach by 31 January 2015. The breaches particularised included: the establishment of a clandestine drug laboratory; the failure to remediate the Property as required by the s 124 notice; and the failures to keep the vegetation “in good condition”, the residential premises “reasonably clean” or to repair the damage to windows and boundary fencing.
	


The resolution of proceedings against Mr Beresford


	
	On 22 December 2014, this Court made the orders by consent that disposed of the proceedings between the plaintiff and Mr Beresford, including an order for judgment for possession of the Property with leave to issue a writ of possession forthwith and the dismissal of Mr Beresford’s cross-claim. By agreement, there was no order as to costs. Correspondence tendered by the plaintiff indicated that Legal Aid acted for Mr Beresford throughout. Mr Hazard maintained, in correspondence with Marsdens, that his client was only prepared to vacate the Property as he was very ill and only as long as there was no order as to costs and that his client was released from any claim.
	
	
	From 26 February 2013, when she retained Marsdens, to 6 January 2015, the plaintiff had incurred costs and disbursements of $94,026.74 excluding GST. Ms Macfarlane adjudged that $49,651.33 (including GST) related to the plaintiff’s claim against Mr Beresford.
	
	
	On 25 February 2015 the plaintiff and her husband met the Sheriff at the Property. At 10am the Sheriff went through the Property and informed them that it was empty. They subsequently inspected the Property and found that it had been trashed. The plaintiff described the condition of the Property as follows:
	


“There were belongings. There was food strewn all over the place. There were holes in walls. There were holes in doors. The kitchen had been completely smashed up. There were doors missing on most of the cabinetry. When I went into the bathroom, the mirror had been taken off the wall and smashed on the ground. The shower screens had been removed. I can't remember if they were broken or not. They were definitely removed. It was a complete tip.”


	
	The plaintiff described her reaction as follows:
	


“I was just overwhelmed. I was in complete shock. We did not expect the property to be in that state at all.”

The aftermath


	
	In early March 2015 the plaintiff arranged for the Property to be remediated, repaired and painted with a view to renting or selling it. Mr Wright acted as the project manager for the repairs and painting of the Property which were conducted through his company. He has yet to submit a final invoice. The plaintiff’s evidence was that it was likely to be in an amount of $200,000.
	
	
	On 28 June 2015 Mr Beresford died at the age of 64 years and three months. The immediate cause of death was cardiopulmonary failure.
	
	
	The plaintiff decided to sell the Property. In mid-July 2015 she exchanged contracts for the sale of the Property for $615,000. The settlement is due to take place in early September 2015. Although her evidence was that she originally planned to rent it out rather than sell it (and this is the basis for her claim for loss of rent), I am not satisfied that she would have done so if she had obtained possession in 2013. Rather, I consider that the probabilities favour the conclusion that, had she obtained possession in 2013, she would have had work done on the Property and sold it. There is no evidence as to what it would have sold for, had it been sold in 2013, rather than 2015.
	
	
	The plaintiff has received a pay-out of $48,000 from Hubbard Insurance by reason of the claim she has made as landlord of the Property.
	


Evidence of loss


	
	The plaintiff claimed damages under three separate heads: legal costs; repair costs and loss of rental income. The quantum spent on legal costs was established by an affidavit from Ms Macfarlane. The repair costs were the subject of a report of Barry Morris, a quantity surveyor, who assessed the cost to bring the Property into a condition whereby it could be tenanted. It was accepted that these works had not been done and the costs not incurred, since, as it happened, the plaintiff decided to sell the Property and it was prepared for sale on a different basis. Mr Wright’s company had done the actual works. The loss of rental income was the subject of a report of Patrick Anderson, a real estate valuer, who gave uncontroverted evidence of the rental income which the Property would have been likely to earn.
	
	
	None of these witnesses was cross-examined. Mr Zahra challenged the relevance of their evidence in submissions and contended, for reasons set out in more detail below, that the plaintiff had not established that she had suffered any loss as a result of the acts or omissions of Mr Pickering.
	


Credibility of witnesses

The plaintiff


	
	Although I consider that the plaintiff’s evidence largely accorded with what she believed to be the truth, I did not consider her evidence to be reliable. It was my impression that she and Mr Wright had gone back over their documents (principally the Conditions of Sale document and the various emails) many years after the events of August 2009 in order to reconstruct what had occurred in order to make a case against Mr Pickering. However, even their reconstruction was at odds with contemporaneous documents. For example, their belief, which appeared to amount to a conviction, that they had seen Mr Pickering twice had no documentary support. Indeed the only reference in their documents to an actual meeting with Mr Pickering was in the email of 19 August 2009 from the plaintiff to Tania which referred to the meeting on 18 August 2009.
	
	
	The objective probabilities were also against there being a conference earlier than 18 August 2009. There was no reason for the plaintiff to see Mr Pickering until he had received the contract from Mr Crichton-Browne. The occurrence of a conference prior to 18 August 2009 is also inconsistent with Mr Pickering’s diary, which was a contemporaneous business record of his commitments during the relevant period and his practice of refusing to see clients who had not made prior appointments.
	
	
	I regard it as a significant factor that weighs against the plaintiff’s reliability as a witness that she did not recall, on 11 September 2009, that she had agreed to pay Mr Beresford’s legal costs, notwithstanding that it had been addressed in conference with Mr Pickering on 18 August 2009 and was contained in the document entitled “Conditions of Sale” that she and her husband had discussed and which he had typed up on 5 August 2009. That she forgot such an important matter within a period of about three weeks indicates that her anxiety to conclude the transaction before Mr Beresford’s death diverted her from the details of the sale, to which she paid no particular attention.
	
	
	The plaintiff also gave evidence, in the course of her cross-examination on 4 August 2015, that was not included in her affidavit, that when she rang Tania to see if she and her husband could see Mr Pickering on 12 August 2009 (which was a Wednesday), Tania said:
	


""He stays back but not for long, if you want to try and make it as soon as you can after 5 o'clock.""


	
	This evidence is to be contrasted with Mr Pickering’s own evidence that he generally worked until 8pm on weeknights, which is corroborated by the pages from his diary that were tendered. The plaintiff’s oral evidence is also inconsistent with Mr Pickering’s appointment diary for 12 August 2009 in which appointments at 5pm; 6pm; and 6.30pm were recorded. In my view, the plaintiff’s evidence about what Tania said about coming as soon after 5pm was a recent invention designed to give verisimilitude to the proposition that there had been a meeting on 12 August 2009, when in fact there was no such meeting.
	
	
	The plaintiff admitted that she had discussed her affidavit evidence with Mr Wright and that they had read each other’s affidavits. She said that they had both attended a conference on 24 September 2014 at her solicitor’s office at which their affidavits were discussed, before they were signed. There is a close similarity between their versions which suggests that there was some collaboration in the preparation of the evidence.
	
	
	Furthermore, the words the and Mr Wright attributed to Mr Pickering, which included an alleged assurance that they were “totally protected” does not fit with the language which I consider, having heard Mr Pickering in the witness box, he would use.
	
	
	I also infer that the plaintiff’s evidence was largely reconstruction rather than recollection since there was a disparity between her evidence and the orthodox progress of such a transaction. The following exchange from Mr Pickering’s cross-examination provides an example:
	


Q. So you would not dispute Ms Greer's account that what you said to her, either on the 12th or the 18th was, ""This is an unusual circumstance. We need to separate the financial aspect from the tenancy agreement. I can do a contract for sale for this.""

A. Well, that's just simply nonsense, because they're not my words that I would use. I'm not preparing the sale contract, the sale contract which was sent to me by the other solicitor. So I'm not preparing a sale contract.

Mr Wright


	
	I did not regard Mr Wright as a reliable witness, although, like the plaintiff, he was, in most respects, telling the truth as he believed it to be. Nonetheless, there were times when his evidence was, in my view, untruthful. For example, Mr Wright was asked in cross-examination about his experience of leases in the following exchange:
	


Q. Have you ever rented a property?

A. I have not, no.

Q. Under a lease?

A. To be honest I don't. I've never rented a property.


	
	Mr Zahra subsequently asked Mr Wright about his business and the premises from which it operated. The following exchange ensued:
	


Q. Do you rent those premises?

A. I do, yes.

Q. So the evidence you gave a little earlier, that you've never rented a property, is false, isn't it?

A. I suppose if you look at it that way, yes.

Q. You know perfectly well what's involved in renting a property, don't you, Mr Wright?

A. In all honesty, my lawyer looked at the lease. I pay a cheque every month.


	
	My impression was that Mr Wright’s evidence that he had never rented a property was a deliberate attempt to downplay his commercial acumen, with a view to exaggerating his (and the plaintiff’s) reliance on Mr Pickering. I regard this matter as adversely affecting his credit.
	
	
	My view that Mr Wright’s evidence of interchanges with Mr Pickering is substantially a reconstruction rather than his recollection was influenced by Mr Wright’s evidence in his affidavit that:
	


“After the meeting with Mr Pickering I sent an email to Jeff Gilbert and gave him Mr Pickering’s details. A copy of that email is annexed and marked “C”.”


	
	Annexure “C” to his affidavit is the email referred to above, dated 12 August 2009, sent at 3.30pm. There was no indication from the contents of the email that there had been any meeting at all. The only matter relating to Mr Pickering in that email was his name and address. Furthermore Mr Crichton-Browne had not yet sent the contract to Mr Pickering as he had only just, by that email, been notified of his identity.
	
	
	Mr Wright denied that he and the plaintiff had spoken to each other about their evidence in the case. He also denied ever reading her affidavit, although her evidence was that they had read each other’s affidavits. I am satisfied that this denial was dishonest. Since he was the one who suggested the transaction to the plaintiff in the first place, it may be that he felt responsible for the situation and the trouble, distress and expense it has caused the plaintiff. After all, he was prepared to wager $20,000 of his own money to repay her for the deposit if the transaction fell through and she could not recover it from Mr Beresford. It may be that, in these circumstances, he felt obliged to conceal their discussions about their evidence. I infer that the denial was borne of an understandable, but misplaced, desire to assist the plaintiff in her case.
	


Mr Pickering


	
	Mr Pickering presented as a plain-speaking, straightforward man, who conducted a high-volume conveyancing practice, the profitability of which depended on his being disciplined with the time he spent with his clients and employing support staff (many of whom were experienced paralegals) to attend to those tasks that he was not required to do himself.
	
	
	I accept his evidence that it was his usual practice to refuse to see clients who dropped in unannounced and also that he generally only saw clients once. I accept his evidence that he had some recollection of the meeting with the plaintiff and Mr Wright, although it was not until many years afterwards that he turned his mind to what had occurred. Although his records were not lengthy, I am satisfied that they sufficiently brought the transaction, which was an unusual one, to mind and that his evidence of what occurred, and of his usual practice, was reliable.
	


Jones v Dunkel inference


	
	Mr Pickering was cross-examined about the whereabouts of Tania, the paralegal who assisted him with the plaintiff’s transaction. His evidence was that he had not asked her to give evidence in these proceedings and explained that she had been in hospital for the last 16 weeks having fallen off a motor bike. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to draw a Jones v Dunkel ((1959) 101 CLR 298) inference from her not being called to give evidence in Mr Pickering’s case.
	


Liability: breach of contract or breach of duty

The application of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)


	
	Section 5A of the Civil Liability Act makes Part 1A applicable to any claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence regardless of whether the claim is brought, relevantly, in tort or in contract. The connection between the alleged breach of contract and the alleged negligence is made plain by the wording of [46] of the second further amended statement of claim which precedes the alleged breaches relied upon:
	


“The second defendant has acted negligently, and in breach of the retainer agreement, by. . . “


	
	Accordingly, Part 1A of the Civil Liability Act applies to the plaintiff’s claim. This means that the principles relating to the duty of care in ss 5B and 5C apply, as do the principles relating to causation in ss 5D and 5E and those relating to contributory negligence in ss 5R and 5S.
	
	
	Furthermore, as the plaintiff’s claim is a claim for economic loss and damage to property in an action for damages (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising from a failure to take reasonable care, it is an “apportionable claim” to which Part 4 of the Civil Liability Act applies: s 34. As a person whose acts and omissions caused the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim, Mr Beresford is a “concurrent wrongdoer”: s 34(2). For the purposes of Part 4, it does not matter that Mr Beresford has died: s 34(4). It does not prevent the plaintiff’s claim being a “single apportionable claim” that her action against Mr Beresford involved a different cause of action than her claim against Mr Pickering: s 34(1A).
	


The plaintiff’s case as pleaded


	
	The plaintiff relevantly alleged in the second further amended statement of claim that:
	


[19]   On or about 12 August 2009:

. . .

c.   the plaintiff instructed the second defendant to include in the Contract for Sale a special condition that:

i.   If the first defendant caused more than $10,000 damage to the Property, then the first defendant’s right to possession of the Property shall terminate and the first defendant shall in such event leave the premises immediately upon being notified by the plaintiff; and

ii.   that all the terms found in the Standard Form Residential Tenancy Agreement would apply to the first defendant’s occupancy of the Property.

Particulars

The plaintiff orally instructed the second defendant that she wanted some conditions that would protect her in the event the first defendant damaged the property and handed to the second defendant a document headed “Conditions of Sale” . . . which included a proposed condition that “if more than $10,000 of wilful damage is done to the property then this agreement ceases and the premises must be vacated” and a proposed condition that “Standard tenant/ landlord rules applies [sic] (Owner to pay all council rates, strata fees and water connection fees, Brian to pay gas, electricity and water usage charges)”.


	
	In [20] of the pleading, the plaintiff alleged that, on or about 18 August 2009, she attended Mr Pickering’s office; was given the draft contract for sale; noted that it did not contain the special conditions pleaded in [19.c] above; and instructed him to ensure that they were included. The plaintiff alleged that Mr Pickering told her that he would arrange for another version of the contract to be prepared and for her to sign the amended version.
	
	
	As appears from the findings of fact set out above, the plaintiff has failed to prove the matters alleged above. I have found that she did not give the Conditions of Sale document to Mr Pickering at any time. I have also found that there was only one meeting between the plaintiff and Mr Pickering and that his meeting occurred on 18 August 2009, at the conclusion of which the plaintiff instructed Mr Pickering to exchange contracts if Mr Beresford agreed to the changes that were proposed on her behalf.
	
	
	The additional difficulty for the plaintiff is that she has, even on her own evidence, failed to prove the condition alleged. Her evidence was that she instructed Mr Pickering (through the Conditions of Sale document, the oral instructions she gave and the email of 19 August 2009) to include a condition in the sale contract that Mr Beresford would have to vacate if more than $10,000 “wilful damage” or “malicious damage” was caused.
	
	
	The discrepancy between the evidence on which the plaintiff relied and her pleaded case was highlighted by Mr Pickering in his defence to the second further amended statement of claim in [5c], where he alleged:
	


“As to paragraph 19, the second defendant:

. . .

c.   says, in further answer to the paragraph, that the document relied on in the particulars to paragraph 19(c) used the expression “more than $10,000 of wilful damage”, not the expression “more than $10,000 damage” pleaded in paragraph 19(c)(i).”


	
	The discrepancy was also relied on by Mr Zahra in his final submissions, both orally and in writing. Notwithstanding that the issue had been well and truly identified, the plaintiff did not seek to amend the pleading to bring the allegation into line with the evidence. In these circumstances, I propose to address the plaintiff’s case in accordance with her pleading. Although a failure to amend a pleading to correspond exactly with the facts established by the evidence does not preclude reliance on such facts (Dare v Pulham (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664), the plaintiff is not entitled to have her pleading treated as if it were other than the basis on which her case was put. This is particularly so where the issue has been specifically identified by the opposing party and no application for leave to amend has been made.
	
	
	Moreover, there may have been a good forensic reason why the pleading was worded thus. Paragraph [19.c.i.] may reflect a concern that it would be more difficult to prove that the damage was “wilful” or “malicious” rather than that there was damage simpliciter. It is important to respect the forensic decisions made by a party’s legal representatives: see, in a criminal context, TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124, especially at [8] per Gleeson CJ. I note for completeness that Ms McDonald continued to rely on the pleading in her written submissions in reply, which were provided pursuant to leave given at the conclusion of the oral hearing.
	
	
	The plaintiff has, accordingly, failed to establish her pleaded case of breach of contract or breach of duty of care (which was based on the failure to act in accordance with instructions). However, even had she been able to establish a breach, there is the further difficulty posed by the circumstance that a term of greater benefit to the plaintiff was implied by law in any event.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions on causation


	
	Ms McDonald accepted that Mr Beresford’s interest in the Property was probably a tenancy for life, rather than a life estate. However, she submitted that, because the clause relating to damage in excess of $10,000 was not included in the sale contract, Mr Beresford was able to exploit the uncertainty and remain on the Property on the footing (whether correct or not) that he had a life estate in the Property. She also contended that it was not enough for Mr Pickering to rely on a term implied by the Conveyancing Act because a term implied by statute is “arcane” and “something that people have to go digging for”.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s submissions as to causation (which I reject for the reasons more fully set out below) were refined in the following extract from Ms McDonald’s written submissions:
	


In the present case, if the term concerning damage over $10,000 had been expressly included in the Contract for Sale, the likelihood, in the events which occurred, is that:

(a) Mr Beresford would not have been able to mount the defence that he did to Ms Greer’s attempts to have him evicted and Ms Greer would have obtained possession of the Property in or around early 2013;

(b) Ms Greer would not have had to commence and prosecute these proceedings;

(c) After cleaning and decontaminating the Property Ms Greer would have rented the Property out and obtained an income;

(d) Ms Greer would not have had to repair the damage to the Property that was caused sometime after mid 2013.


	
	It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that, had Mr Pickering included the clause relating to damage that the plaintiff had wanted included in the contract for sale, Mr Beresford would not have obtained a grant of legal aid, since there would not have been an arguable defence on the merits to qualify him for such a grant. Ms McDonald argued that the omission of the damages clause created sufficient ambiguity to enable Mr Hazard of Legal Aid to lodge a caveat on the basis of an alleged life estate and to argue, on behalf of Mr Beresford, that the Lease was inoperative because the right to possession amounted to past consideration and the rent of $1 did not amount to valuable consideration.
	
	
	The unstated (and unproved) premiss of the plaintiff’s case was that, if Mr Pickering had not obtained legal representation, he would not have resisted the plaintiff’s claim for possession or the plaintiff would have obtained, in early 2013, default judgment for possession, or at least an order for possession. On that scenario, the plaintiff contended that she would have rented out the Property in early 2013 and avoided the damage that was done to the Property subsequently.
	
	
	Ms McDonald relied on Hudson Investment Group Ltd v Atanaskovic [2014] NSWCA 255 in which it was found that the appellant was entitled to damages as it was forced to compromise its claim because of the respondent’s negligent drafting of a deed. She contended that Mr Pickering had been negligent in failing to spell out her right to evict in the contract for sale and that, if he had done so, that the plaintiff would have been able to evict Mr Beresford and that, accordingly, he was liable for the consequences of that negligence, being the time and cost required to evict Mr Beresford and the cost of repairs resulting from the damage to the Property occasioned by the delay.
	


Mr Pickering’s defence


	
	Mr Pickering’s response to the allegation that he was in breach of the contract of retainer and also negligent in failing to include the damages clause in the sale contract, appears succinctly from the following exchange in his cross-examination:
	


Q. Can I put it this way: you would accept, wouldn't you, that you could imagine that unless parties' rights are spelled out in a document clearly as express terms, disputes may readily arise? They may arise of course anyway but they may more readily arise if they're not clearly spelled out in a document?

A. You know as well as I do there are implied terms.


	
	Mr Zahra submitted that it would be quite wrong to impose on solicitors an obligation to educate the parties to a contract by spelling out all that the law provides, or implies, rather than to draft an agreement that protects the client’s rights. He referred to the absurdity of requiring a solicitor to articulate all the terms implied by statute into every contract (such as that goods be fit for their purpose), as well as statutory prohibitions (for example against misleading or deceptive conduct).
	
	
	Mr Zahra also submitted that the protection provided by the terms implied by statute was, in any event, greater than the clause (in whatever precise form) contended for by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff ought be taken to have accepted the force of the clauses by her pleading, in which she relied on breaches of the implied terms.
	


The plaintiff’s reply


	
	Ms McDonald contended in reply:
	


“The inclusion of these terms in the Contract for Sale arguably negatived or varied the covenants that may otherwise have been implied into the lease arrangement established by the Contract for Sale, by virtue of s 84 and 85 of the Conveyancing Act 1999 (NSW)(CA), as permitted by s 74 of the CA. Certainly, from Ms Greer’s point of view, the $10,000 Damages Clause was, contrary to the submissions of counsel for Mr Pickering, a far better and more useful provision than the Implied Terms, as it permitted her, in the specified circumstances, to immediately evict Mr Beresford, rather than obliging her to allow Mr Beresford an uncertain “reasonable time” to effect repairs himself and giving her the ability to evict him only if he failed to completed the repairs within the time specified in the notice given, as stipulated by sections 84 and 85 of the CA.”

Analysis of the legal position concerning the contract for sale and the Lease


	
	Section 84(1)(a) of the Conveyancing Act incorporates an implied term into leases to the effect that the lessee is obliged to keep the demised premises in good and tenantable repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Although s 84(1)(b) provides that the section applies to leases under the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), the same covenants are implied into an agreement for lease. Section 85(1)(d) confers an implied power on the lessor, if the lessee is in default of the covenant to repair and the default continues for two months, to terminate the lease, without releasing the lessee from liability for the breach of covenant.
	
	
	Section 74 of the Conveyancing Act provides that implied covenants can be negatived, varied or extended by an express declaration in the deed wherein it is implied, or another deed. The effect of s 129(1) of the Conveyancing Act is that the lessor must give a notice to the lessee to remedy the breach before terminating.
	
	
	There is nothing “arcane” about these provisions. They form the basis of the study of real property in New South Wales and, as such, they are not only fundamental aspects of a legal education but also prerequisites to admission to legal practice in this jurisdiction. That lay persons, and indeed some lawyers, might not be familiar with them is not to the point.
	
	
	The contract for sale not only provided for the transfer of the legal title in fee simple to the Property from Mr Beresford to the plaintiff, but it also created an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff, as the owner of the Property (in equity from exchange to settlement and at law once the transfer was registered), granted a right to Mr Beresford to exclusive possession of the Property on terms. The two requirements for a lease: first, that the possession granted be exclusive; and, second, that the term is certain, or capable or being rendered certain, were fulfilled by the contract for sale.
	
	
	I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the contract for sale could reasonably be regarded as creating a life estate. The circumstance that it included a term that the plaintiff would be liable for rates but Mr Beresford would be liable for usage of water, electricity etc. strongly suggests that a tenancy rather than a life estate was what was intended. To the extent to which there was any ambiguity, recourse could be had to extrinsic evidence to establish the Codelfa factual matrix (named, eponymously, after Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 352-353 per Mason J). Such extrinsic evidence, as the plaintiff’s and Mr Wright’s affidavits established, was that, far from retaining a life estate in the Property, Mr Beresford was anxious to divest himself of it, lest it be appropriated by the Australian Taxation Office to pay his tax debts (or potentially forfeited to the State pursuant to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), although the latter risk was never articulated and does not appear in the evidence).
	
	
	Because the contract for sale created a lease, the terms implied by ss 84 and 85 were part of that contract. Such terms were also implied into the Lease. I take the plaintiff to accept these matters, as they formed part of her pleading against Mr Beresford.
	
	
	The effect of the inclusion in the Lease of the additional term, (a) (relating to significant damage, being damage in excess of $10,000), was to confer on the plaintiff an additional right to terminate the Lease by immediate notice. Accordingly, in the event of (a) applying, no notice to remedy the breach under s 129(1) of the Conveyancing Act was required. As there was no express declaration that negatived, varied or extended the terms implied by ss 84 and 85, they continued to form part of the contract for sale and the Lease: s 74.
	
	
	I regard the suggestion that the Lease was not binding, or would not have been enforced because Mr Beresford was already in possession of the Property before its commencement, as without merit. The Lease commenced on 6 October 2009. He occupied the Property prior to that date pursuant to the contract for sale. Merely because the rent stipulated was $1, does not mean either that there was insufficient consideration or that consideration was lacking. Mutual promises can amount to consideration: Mr Beresford’s covenants to keep the premises in good repair and to pay utility charges are sufficient to constitute valuable consideration and were given in return for the plaintiff’s promise to allow him to enjoy exclusive possession and to pay the rates on the Property for the duration of the term. In my view, neither party to the transaction could be regarded as a “volunteer”.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the Lease and the contract for sale as concurrent sources of her right to evict Mr Beresford. In Hudson Investment Group Ltd v Atanaskovic, the relevant ambiguity was found to have been caused by negligent drafting. The present is not such a case. There was, in my view, no relevant ambiguity. The fact that Mr Beresford took a position that had the effect of delaying proceedings, and deferring his eviction, does not mean that the legal position was, in fact, uncertain or ambiguous; or that Mr Pickering’s acts or omissions had contributed to any legal uncertainty or ambiguity. The transaction, though not standard, was not particularly complex and was sufficiently documented. The argument that Mr Beresford had a legal right to continued occupation irrespective of any breaches of the Lease (of which there were several) was, in my view, untenable.
	
	
	The plaintiff chose that not to take steps to evict Mr Beresford until late 2012. That she failed to obtain possession until December 2014 was the result both of Mr Beresford’s intransigence and her failure to enforce her legal rights by applying for urgent relief. Although she might be regarded as an unfortunate victim of Mr Beresford’s wrongdoing, her own conduct amounted, in the context of her claim against Mr Pickering, both to contributory negligence (had I found him to be negligent) and to an unreasonable failure to mitigate her loss.
	


Causation


	
	The determination of what difference, if any, it would have made had a clause to the effect alleged been included in the contract for sale raises substantial issues of causation. Section 5D of the Civil Liability Act requires, before a determination is made that negligence caused particular harm, a finding that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm (factual causation) and a finding that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).
	
	
	It is, at best, problematic to speculate on what would have occurred had a clause entitling the plaintiff to terminate the lease for damage (whether malicious, wilful, in excess of a monetary figure, or otherwise) been included in that document.
	
	
	The inference that the presence or absence of such clause would have made a difference to Legal Aid is debatable. No evidence has been adduced from Mr Hazard. Although communications between him and Mr Beresford were privileged, he could still have given evidence as to the basis on which legal aid was granted.
	
	
	The inference that the presence or absence of such a clause would have made a difference to Mr Beresford is even more vexed. As Gleeson CJ said in Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; 205 CLR 254 at [19], [26] and [29], criminal behaviour is not predictable, which makes it more difficult to draw inferences as to what would have occurred in hypothetical situations. Mr Beresford’s cavalier approach to the law was amply demonstrated by the methylamphetamine laboratory which was conducted on the Property while he was in possession. His trenchant refusal to relinquish possession was hardly likely to be transformed into capitulation had he been deprived of the resources of Legal Aid. Indeed, in my view, the probabilities favour the inference that he would have stood his ground (however legally unsustainable) until he was required, either by Court order, or by his own mortality and decrepitude, to vacate the Property, as eventually occurred in December 2014.
	
	
	In my view, the damage suffered by the plaintiff was caused by the deplorable conduct of Mr Beresford and the plaintiff’s failure to assert her legal rights with expedition to stop the conduct and regain possession of her Property. Even had I found negligence, I would not have been satisfied that it was a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm (being the damage to the Property, the legal fees or the lost rental income). In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff bears the onus of proof of every fact relevant to the issue of causation: s 5E of the Civil Liability Act.
	
	
	Moreover, I am not persuaded that it would be appropriate to extend the scope of the Mr Pickering’s liability to the harm caused by Mr Beresford’s wrongful conduct. Accordingly, the plaintiff has established neither factual causation nor scope of liability within the meaning of s 5D of the Civil Liability Act. There are further impediments to causation which are addressed below in the context of damages.
	


Alleged contributory negligence and failure to mitigate


	
	Contributory negligence is governed by s 5R of the Civil Liability Act. The relevant question is whether the person who suffered harm has failed to take precautions against the risk of harm. The harm arose from the activities of Mr Beresford during his continuing occupation of the Property, since this is the harm that is said to have caused damage to the plaintiff. It was within the plaintiff’s hands to obtain an order for his eviction. Her failure to do so from the first breaches in 2009 was unreasonable. The longer Mr Beresford stayed there the worse it became. Although, in one sense, the plaintiff was an unfortunate victim of Mr Beresford’s wrongdoing, it was in her hands (and her solicitors’, on her behalf) to assert and enforce her legal rights. I regard the plaintiff’s contributory negligence in failing to apply to this Court for urgent relief to evict Mr Beresford as of a very high order.
	
	
	I reject the plaintiff’s submission (which is at odds with s 5R of the Civil Liability Act) that the only aspect of the plaintiff’s conduct that is relevant to contributory negligence is that which occurred prior to the settlement of the sale of the Property.
	


Damages


	
	Ms McDonald contended that the loss of rental income, repair costs and legal costs were a foreseeable and recoverable consequence of Mr Pickering’s alleged breach. She submitted that interest ought be awarded on the sums for loss of rental and legal costs but accepted that interest was not payable on the repair costs as the figures in Mr Morris’ report were hypothetical and were not referable to the monies actually spent.
	
	
	Even had I found that Mr Pickering was in breach of contract or negligent in failing to include a clause in the contract for sale, I would not have awarded damages as claimed. Had the plaintiff asserted her rights expeditiously she would have regained possession by early 2013 at the latest and not suffered the losses she claims.
	


Claim for legal costs


	
	The legal costs incurred were a result of Mr Beresford’s intransigence and were aggravated by a relatively torturous legal path to the ultimate remedy, for which Mr Pickering ought not be held responsible. I reject Ms McDonald’s submission that it was incumbent on Mr Zahra to put to Ms Macfarlane in cross-examination that the costs incurred were unreasonable. It was clear from his cross-examination of the plaintiff that he proposed to make a submission that the legal fees for Marsdens’ professional services were not reasonably related, or proportionate, to the remedy sought. This was sufficient to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67: Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 23 – 26 per Hunt J.
	
	
	In my view, the amount of such fees and the period over which they were incurred required some explanation. None was forthcoming from Ms Macfarlane. Accordingly a Jones v Dunkel inference arises against the plaintiff from Ms Macfarlane’s failure to give evidence about these matters.
	


Claim for costs of repair


	
	The plaintiff has failed to establish when the Property was damaged. Although Ms McDonald submitted that it was damaged after Mr Beresford left it, the evidence established that he did not keep it in good tenantable repair while he was in possession. It is possible that a substantial amount of the damage was caused between the making of the order for possession and the arrival of the Sheriff to execute the writ some months later. It is difficult to see how this could be attributed to any act or omission of Mr Pickering. The evidence of these costs was hypothetical in any event, as the plaintiff had engaged Mr Wright’s company to restore the Property for sale. There is no basis in the evidence to reconcile Mr Morris’s figures (which were based on his assessment, as a quantity surveyor, of the costs of rectification and repair, excluding costs associated with the remediation as a result of the clandestine drug laboratory) with what Mr Wright has actually been done, the plaintiff’s attempts to adduce that evidence for the first time orally in the course of the hearing having been disallowed upon objection. Accordingly, even if causation had otherwise been established, I would not have awarded damages based on the alleged repair costs.
	


Claim for rental income


	
	As referred to above, I am not satisfied that, had the plaintiff obtained possession earlier, she would have rented it out. Accordingly, the evidence of Mr Anderson, a real estate valuer, who gave uncontroverted evidence of the rental income which the Property would have been likely to earn, was irrelevant.
	
	
	It is not appropriate in the present case to engage in “guesswork” to assess damages. Unlike Commonwealth v Amann Aviation (1991) 174 CLR 64, this is not a case where the nature of the breach is such as to render impossible the calculation of damages on the orthodox basis. Nor is the present case in any way analogous to that of a plaintiff who has been tortiously injured at such a young age that the future (and the associated damages) can only be predicted in a speculative manner. The plaintiff has simply failed to discharge her onus to establish a connection between any matter for which Mr Pickering was responsible and the categories and quantum of damages she claimed. In these circumstances it is not for the Court to substitute speculation for evidence.
	


Proportionate wrongdoer


	
	For the reasons given above concerning the application of the Civil Liability Act, the liability of Mr Pickering is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the Court considers just, having regard to the extent of his responsibility for the damage or loss, and the Court may give judgment against the second defendant for not more than that amount: s 35(1); see also the discussion in Reinhold v New South Wales Lotteries Corporation (No. 2) [2008] NSWSC 187; 82 NSWLR 762 per Barrett J.
	
	
	Mr Beresford’s conduct in failing to quit the Property and in either causing damage to the Property, or allowing damage to be caused to the Property by others, were the principal, real and effective causes of the plaintiff’s loss. Mr Pickering was unaware of what was occurring on the Property in the years from 2009 until he was joined to these proceedings in 2014. During the whole of that period Mr Beresford was acting in contumelious disregard of the plaintiff’s legal rights which, for the most part, the plaintiff was doing little, if anything, to enforce. In these circumstances I do not consider it to be just for Mr Pickering, even had he been negligent in failing to include the clause alleged and even if that negligence had, in some way, contributed to the plaintiff’s loss, to have to bear any responsibility for the plaintiff’s loss.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the second defendant.
	
	
	Unless an application for a different order is made in writing to my Associate within seven days hereof, order the plaintiff to pay the second defendant’s costs of the proceedings.

2702926,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1171,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	This is an application brought pursuant to s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act). Moving upon a further amended summons filed on 10 April 2015, the plaintiff seeks an order that two sums of cash transferred into a particular bank account on 15 January 2015 be forfeited to the Commonwealth. The plaintiff also seeks an ancillary order that the Commonwealth have leave to dispose of or otherwise deal with the property in question immediately. Additionally, the plaintiff seeks to have those two orders entered forthwith.
	
	
	One of the sums in question is a little under US$60,000. Notably, the other sum is something over US$11 million.
	
	
	In a separate judgment delivered earlier today, I gave reasons why I was content to hear the matter ex parte.
	
	
	I was provided with judgments of two judges of this Court with regard to the section in question that provided a helpful background: Application of the Australian Federal Police re matter 2012/249599 [2013] NSWSC 1444; and Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2013] NSWSC 1428.
	
	
	The solicitor for the plaintiff took me through s 49 of the Act. She submitted that every precondition for the mandatory making of a forfeiture order had been satisfied on the evidence and submissions placed before me.
	
	
	First, turning to the chapeau of s 49(1), she submitted that this Court is a court with proceeds jurisdiction, by way of s 335 of the Act.
	
	
	Secondly, with regard to s 49(1)(a), she submitted that her client, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, is a responsible authority, as defined in s 338 of the Act.
	
	
	Thirdly, with regard to the same subsection, she submitted that a restraining order as defined in s 338 of the Act had been sought and granted, pursuant to s 19 of the Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, turning to s 49(1)(b), because that restraining order was first made by Garling J on 11 February 2015, it has been in force for at least six months as at today, 13 August 2015.
	
	
	Fifthly, the solicitor for the plaintiff submitted that s 49(1)(c) has no application, due to the operation of s 49(3), to which I shall turn in a moment.
	
	
	Sixthly, my threshold judgment with regard to proceeding ex parte was founded upon s 49(1)(e).
	
	
	Seventhly, s 49(2) merely informs s 49(1)(c), and accordingly was not relied upon.
	
	
	Eighthly, as for s 49(3), I am satisfied that no application has been made by the defendant for exclusion of the property in question from the restraining order. Accordingly, I accept the submission that I do not need to be satisfied of any attribute of the property in question as envisaged by s 49(1)(c). Having said that, I interpolate to say that I accept the overarching submission of the solicitor for the plaintiff that the funds are held in a bank account in Australia in very suspicious circumstances.
	
	
	Returning to my seriatim analysis of the preconditions contained in s 49 of the Act, I have turned my mind to whether the discretion not to make an order contained in s 49(4) is enlivened. But it can be seen that, in order to exercise any such discretion, I would need to be satisfied of three things: first, that the funds are an instrument of a serious offence (other than a terrorism offence); secondly, that the funds are not proceeds of an offence; and thirdly, that it is not in the public interest to make the order.
	
	
	On the evidence and submissions placed before me, I am not satisfied affirmatively of any of those three matters, let alone all of them. Accordingly no discretion to refuse to make the orders sought arises.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I propose to make the three orders sought by the plaintiff and helpfully contained in Short Minutes of Orders handed up at the end of the hearing before me, and which I shall now endorse.
	


[ORDERS MADE]


	
	Pursuant to section 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (""the Act""), the property restrained by this Court on 11 February 2015 and set out in Schedule One to these orders, be forfeited to the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Pursuant to section 69(2) of the Act, the Commonwealth be given leave to dispose of or otherwise deal with the property forfeited by order 1 herein, immediately.
	
	
	These orders be entered forthwith.
	


[Schedule 1 not included in judgment.]

[Further submissions made.]


	
	Supplementary submissions were made in support of an order directed towards the further progress of the matter before this Court. I am content to accept those submissions and make the further order sought.
	
	
	Accordingly, my fourth order is as follows:
	


(4) The proceedings are stood over generally before the Common Law Registrar for further directions at 9 am on 13 October 2015.

2702938,Waller v James [2015] NSWCA 232,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellants, Deborah and Lawrence Waller, are the parents of Keeden Waller, who was conceived through in vitro fertilisation treatment co-ordinated by the respondent, Dr Christopher James. Keeden was born with anti-thrombin deficiency (ATD), which he genetically inherited from the second appellant. Four days after his birth, Keeden suffered an extensive cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT), being a form of stroke. As a result, Keeden is, and will remain, profoundly disabled, and will require care for the remainder of his life.

The appellants brought proceedings alleging that the respondent was in breach of contract and had breached his duty of care to them by having failed to cause them to be informed of the hereditary aspects of ATD. They contended that, were it not for that failure, they would have deferred undergoing the IVF procedures until they could do so without risk of having a child with ATD, and that a result of this deferral would have been that they would not have had a child who suffered a CSVT. The appellants claimed damages for the costs of raising Keeden and for physical and psychological injuries they claimed to have suffered as a result of his disabilities.

The trial judge, Hislop J, gave judgment for the respondent, finding that although his duty of care extended to ensuring the provision of information relating to the inheritability of ATD, and he had breached that duty, causation was not made out, the scope of his duty did not extend to the harm suffered, and the loss suffered was too remote. A finding that Keeden’s ATD was not causally related to the occurrence of the CSVT was not challenged on appeal.

On the appeal, the appellants contended that, as a result of the respondent’s negligence, they suffered harm identified as a deprivation of their right to plan their family and reproductive future. The respondent, by notice of contention, disputed certain of the trial judge’s factual findings relating to whether the appellants would have obtained genetic counselling if the respondent had acted in the way the appellant contended he ought or, having obtained such counselling, whether they would have had Keeden. The scope and content of the respondent’s duty of care, breach, causation, remoteness of damage, contributory negligence and damages were all in issue.

Per Beazley P, McColl and Ward JJA agreeing

(1)   There was no error in the factual findings challenged by the respondent. Appellate restraint was warranted in relation to those findings which were made by reference both to matters subjective to the witnesses and the objective circumstances. [62]-[71].

Rosenberg v Percival [2001] HCA 18; 205 CLR 434; Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118.

(2)   The appellants’ right to plan their family by choosing whether and when to have a child was an interest the infringement of which could give rise to a claim for economic loss. [129]-[130].

Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees [2013] HCA 10; 247 CLR 613; Cattanach v Melchior [2003] HCA 38; 215 CLR 1. 

(3)   The respondent’s duty of care extended to the provision of information to the appellants relating to the importance of seeking genetic counselling and arguably to following up with the appellants as to whether they had done so. [131]-[137], [235]-[238].

Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375; Rosenberg v Percival [2001] HCA 18; 205 CLR 434; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Limited v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649; Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35; 211 CLR 317.

(4)   The provision of a referral to a genetic counsellor by way of a post-it note did not constitute a breach of duty in the circumstances of this case. Rather, as the trial judge found, the respondent’s breach was in failing to adequately explain the reason for the referral. [138]-[144].

Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12; 146 CLR 40; Gover v South Australia & Perram (1985) 39 SASR 543.

(5)   The harm suffered by the appellants, being that consequent on Keeden’s CSVT, was not causally connected to the breach by the respondent of his duty of care, as the CSVT was coincidental, for legal purposes, to the inheritance of ATD, and the risks of each should not be accumulated. [185]-[195], [226]-[233], [239]-[252].

Cattanach v Melchior [2003] HCA 38; 215 CLR 1; Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375; Roads and Traffic Authority v Royal [2008] HCA 19; 82 ALJR 870; Moyes v Lothian Health Board 1990 SCT 444; [1990] 1 Med LR 463; Kenny and Good v MGICA [1999] HCA 25; 199 CLR 413; Wallace v Kam [2012] NSWCA 82; [2012] Aust Torts Reports ¶82-101; Barnes v Hay (1988) 12 NSWLR 337; Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52; (2001) 206 CLR 459; Paul v Cooke [2013] NSWCA 311; 85 NSWLR 167.

(6)   The risk of Keeden suffering a stroke was not a risk of the same kind as being born with ATD but was encompassed within the normal risks of pregnancy and IVF that the appellants were willing to accept. In those circumstances, the harm suffered as a result of Keeden’s stroke was not within the scope of the risk created by the respondent’s negligence and was not relevantly foreseeable, and it was therefore too remote to be recoverable. [208]-[210], [239].

	BEAZLEY P:
	


Introduction


	
	The first and second appellants are, respectively, the mother and father of Keeden Waller. Keeden was conceived by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. The treatment had been co-ordinated by the respondent, Dr James, who practised as a general gynaecologist with a sub-specialty in infertility and IVF.
	
	
	Keeden, who was born on 10 August 2000, has anti-thrombin deficiency (ATD), also known as Factor III Deficiency or AT3, which he genetically inherited from the second appellant. Four days after his birth, Keeden suffered an extensive cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT), being a form of stroke. As a result, Keeden is, and will remain, profoundly disabled, and will require care for the remainder of his life. The appellants are both full time carers for Keeden.
	
	
	The appellants brought proceedings against the respondent alleging breach of contract and breach of the respondent’s duty of care to them as his patients.
	
	
	A key aspect of the appellants’ case at trial, that Keeden’s ATD caused or materially contributed to the stroke he suffered when he was four days old, was rejected by the trial judge. That finding is not challenged on the appeal. However, the appellants contend that the respondent breached his contract and his common law duty of care in failing to inform them, or cause them to be informed, of the hereditary aspects of ATD. They contended that had they been so informed, they would have deferred undergoing the IVF procedures in October/November 1999 until the respondent had identified methods to ensure that only embryos not affected by the AT3 mutation would be transferred to the first appellant.
	
	
	As articulated on the appeal, the appellants identified the harm they suffered as a deprivation of their:
	


“… right to plan their family or reproductive future in terms of choosing if, whether and when they would undertake the moral and legal responsibility to rear and maintain a child.”


	
	The appellants contended that this right to plan a family is a right recognised at law: Cattanach v Melchior [2003] HCA 38; 215 CLR 1 at [66]. The essence of the allegation was that the appellants had not been able properly to exercise their “right to plan their family” because they had not been given adequate information as to the inheritability of ATD and that the respondent caused this to occur by failing to inform them himself, give them an adequate referral, or follow up on whether they had been to see the genetic counsellor to whom he had referred them.
	
	
	They argued that due to the respondent’s negligence, they unknowingly ran the risk of passing on the ATD gene, which was the very risk they would not have taken but for the respondent’s negligence. That risk came home: Keeden was born with the inherited ATD gene.
	
	
	The appellants claimed for the cost of Keeden’s future care. They also claimed that the first appellant suffered from a chronic dysthymic disorder caused by or resulting from Keeden’s injuries and disabilities. Both the appellants claimed they had suffered an ongoing psychological injury caused by or resulting from Keeden’s disabilities.
	
	
	The harm they suffered was not the birth of their child: see Cattanach v Melchior at [68]. The appellants submitted, by reference to the failed sterilisation cases, that the monetary value of the ‘joy’ of a child was irrelevant to their claim for damages, and that it was also irrelevant to a claim for damages such as theirs whether a child was healthy or disabled: Cattanach v Melchior at [179] and [78], respectively. They contended that at the very least, they were entitled to the cost of rearing and maintaining Keeden without regard to the extra costs attributable to the severe disabilities caused by his CSVT, although they did not abandon that claim. They also claimed to be entitled to damages for the cost of and for undergoing the IVF procedures and the birth, as, but for the respondent’s negligence, they would not have undergone the procedures when they did and Keeden would not have been born.
	
	
	The respondent accepted that he owed a duty of care to the appellants, but defended the claim on the bases of scope of duty, breach, causation and remoteness of damage.
	
	
	The primary judge, Hislop J, gave judgment for the respondent: Waller v James [2013] NSWSC 497. For the reasons that follow, the appeal against his Honour’s judgment should be dismissed.
	


Issues on the appeal


	
	The appellants filed a notice of appeal on 2 August 2013. The respondent filed a notice of contention dated 29 August 2013. The notice of appeal and notice of contention raised the following six issues for consideration:
	



	
	Scope of duty: Whether the primary judge erred in defining the scope of the respondent’s duty of care (notice of contention ground 1);
	
	
	Breach of duty: Whether the primary judged erred in finding that the respondent did not breach his duty of care to refer the appellants to an appropriate person to inform them of the inheritability of ATD, as he provided the details of Ms Duggan, genetic counsellor, to the appellants on a post-it note (appeal ground 1);
	
	
	Causation:
	



	
	Whether the primary judge ought to have found that causation was established even if the ATD was not found to have caused or materially contributed to the CSVT (appeal grounds 2, 4, and 5);
	
	
	Whether the primary judge erred in his factual findings that, had the respondent not breached his duty of care, the appellants would have sought and obtained advice as to the hereditary aspects of ATD, and would then have refrained from having a child using the second appellant’s sperm (notice of contention grounds 2 and 3);
	



	
	Remoteness of damage: Whether the primary judge erred in finding that the damage claimed by the appellants was too remote to be recoverable (appeal ground 6);
	
	
	Contributory negligence: If the respondent is found liable, whether the primary judge erred in failing to find that the damages recoverable by the appellants should be reduced for contributory negligence (notice of contention ground 4(a));

Factual background

ATD


	
	ATD is a genetic condition that can affect a person’s normal clotting pattern and can give rise to an increased risk of thrombosis.
	
	
	The pattern of inheritance of ATD is autosomal dominant, which means that it is capable of being passed on to a child of either gender with only one parent suffering from the condition. There is a 50 per cent chance that a person who carries the ATD gene will pass that gene onto his or her child. Of those who carry the gene, approximately 50-60 per cent will develop symptoms over their lifetime. There is, accordingly, a 25-30 per cent chance that the child of a person carrying the gene will develop symptoms over his or her lifetime.
	
	
	The condition is not rare and thousands of children are born with the condition in Australia each year. Professor Paul Monagle, a paediatric haematologist, reported a prevalence rate in the general population of approximately one in every 250 people.
	
	
	ATD is generally understood as a disease of adulthood in that it does not usually become symptomatic in the form of a thrombosis until a person is in their twenties or thirties, although it may become symptomatic earlier. The condition can be managed, as it was in the case of the second appellant, through Warfarin, an anti-coagulant medication, and blood tests to monitor international normalised ratio (INR) levels. ATD rarely has any effect on children, and it is very uncommon for a neonate (a baby under four weeks of age) with ATD to suffer thrombosis. CSVT itself is a very rare condition, affecting, on the evidence of Associate Professor Evans, only 0.67 children per 100,000. This means that there is a 0.00067 per cent chance of a person suffering a CSVT during childhood.
	
	
	In 1999, Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), being the genetic testing of embryos, was not available. Associate Professor David Amor, a clinical geneticist called by the appellants, gave evidence that:
	


“… in 1999 PGD for single gene disorders was yet to be performed in Australia, and was still regarded as an experimental technology with unproven accuracy.”


	
	Associate Professor Amor said that if asked in 1999, he would have said there was a reasonable chance these tests would become available within the following three to five years, but this was not certain and they might not be available until quite a lot longer.
	


The appellants


	
	The appellants were married in November 1997. At this time, the second appellant was aware that he suffered from ATD. He had been admitted to Wollongong Hospital in 1988 suffering from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and remained there for about one month. He had been informed by the treating haematologist that his DVT and PE were attributable to his ATD.
	
	
	The first appellant was aware of the second appellant’s condition. At around the time of their marriage, the first appellant suggested to the second appellant that he see a doctor to find out about the potential impact of his ATD on having children. The second appellant agreed to see a doctor. The records of the second appellant’s General Practitioner, Dr Noonan, contained an entry from December 1997 that read:
	


“5 Dec 1997   Factor III syndrome rpt Warfarin 5mgm …

left message with Kerry Duggan re info

8/12   Inherited disorder, need to be homozygous to have it will chase up details re tests avail”


	
	The entry appears to have been made by Dr Noonan’s locum, Dr Miller. Neither Dr Miller nor Dr Noonan gave evidence and, as the primary judge recorded, neither the second appellant nor Ms Duggan recollected a consultation or any discussion of the matter. The primary judge commented that the note from 8 December may have been a record of the doctor’s own research. Nonetheless, the note does indicate that some enquiry was made by the second appellant about his condition and its inheritability shortly after the appellants married.
	
	
	In March 1998, Dr Noonan referred the second appellant to Dr Ramakrishna, a haematologist whom he saw on 27 March 1998. It appears that either as a result of what he was told by Dr Ramakrishna, or because he misunderstood what he was told, the second appellant misunderstood the inheritability of ATD. After seeing Dr Ramakrishna, he understood that if his wife did not have the condition, it was impossible for him to pass it on to his children. The first appellant gave evidence that the second appellant told her, immediately after he saw Dr Ramakrishna, that they were “right to have kids”. The first appellant understood that there would be no impact on her children if ATD did not run in her family. The primary judge noted that the source of the second appellant’s erroneous understanding of Dr Ramakrishna’s advice was uncertain, but he accepted that the appellants were genuinely under this misapprehension.
	


The consultations with the respondent


	
	The appellants gave evidence that they had attempted to conceive from the time of the second appellant’s consultation with Dr Ramakrishna, but without success. In January 1999, they consulted Dr Noonan who, on 18 January, referred them to the respondent.
	
	
	The letter of referral from Dr Noonan to the respondent dated 18 January 1999 read:
	


“Subject - Ms Deborah Waller

DOB 11/6/74

Problem - Fertility assistance.

24 yr ♀

on [oral contraceptive] for 3 yrs continuously

No [history of] pregnancy

Married for 1 yr - trying to conceive

Husband (Laurie) has Factor III deficiency and takes Warfarin daily.

Please assess.”


	
	The respondent was an accredited doctor with Sydney IVF. In Sydney IVF’s brochure, given to the appellants, the following information was provided:
	


“As well as fertility treatments, Sydney IVF also specializes in all aspects of genetic analysis to do with fertility and pregnancy, including prenatal testing, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and specialized diagnostic tests for genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and fragile X.

For couples with a family history of a genetic disease or who are known or suspected carriers for a genetic disease, prenatal or preimplantation (embryo) testing is recommended.

Men with extreme infertility due to the congenital absence of the vas deferens are possible carriers for genes associated with cystic fibrosis, and should consider genetic testing before starting an IVF program.

Genetic analysis can also be conducted for repeated miscarriage. This can determine whether the cause of the miscarriages is genetic, and what can be done to improve chances of pregnancy if that is or is not the case.”

(The basis of the statement in respect of prenatal or preimplantation embryo testing in this pamphlet and its asserted availability, given Associate Professor Amor’s opinion that such testing was in an experimental stage and was not available in Australia in 1999, was unexplained in the evidence.)


	
	The appellants’ first consultation with the respondent was on 3 March 1999. The first appellant gave evidence that, at this time, she went to see the respondent because having children was important to her, and the second appellant agreed that he was “keen to have kids of [his] own”.
	
	
	It was common ground that the second appellant’s ATD was referred to during the first consultation. The respondent’s notes from the first consultation included the following entry under the heading “Partner”:
	


“Lawrence 33 Car detailing Factor III def (warfarin) DVT + pulmonary embolus”


	
	However, the second appellant gave evidence that he did not raise the issue of the inheritability of ATD with the respondent because he was relying on the advice of Dr Ramakrishna. He stated in cross-examination:
	


“Q. You didn’t raise the issue of possible transmission to kids with Dr James at any time, did you?

A. No. Because I’d been given the information from the haematologist …”

He also stated in his evidence that he had not told the respondent that the issue was important to him, nor that he found his ATD to be a burden. The appellants did not tell the respondent of the second appellant’s consultation with Dr Ramakrishna.


	
	The respondent was cross-examined as to whether he knew, at the first consultation, of the second appellant’s concern about ATD being passed on to any child they had and gave the following evidence:
	


“A. … I do remember that neither [the first or second appellant] at that time or at other visits were unduly – were worried about [the second appellant’s] AT III deficiency.

Q. That’s the impression that you have?

A. That’s the strong impression I had.”

The respondent said that the appellants “certainly didn’t tell me they were worried” about the second appellant’s ATD deficiency being passed on.

Referral for genetic counselling


	
	Notwithstanding this evidence, the respondent agreed that it was consistent with his obligation as a medical practitioner treating the appellants for infertility, including by way of IVF, to refer the appellants to a genetic counsellor, given the second appellant’s condition. The respondent agreed that the reason for such a referral was the need for the appellants to have access to a genetic counsellor to obtain information so that they could form a view as to whether or not they were concerned with the possible consequences of this condition being passed on.
	
	
	In his original statement of evidence, the respondent said that based on his usual practice, he would have told the appellants to ring Ms Duggan to discuss the second appellant’s ATD “and its genetic aspects and if necessary, [Ms Duggan] will make arrangements for [the appellants] to see a geneticist at Wollongong Hospital”.
	
	
	In his answers to interrogatories, the respondent explained that the purposes of suggesting that the appellants contact Ms Duggan were:
	


“(i)   so that she could discuss with them the AT3 condition and if necessary then make arrangements for them to see [a] geneticist at Wollongong Hospital

(ii)   for them to learn more about the AT3 condition, to ascertain the implications for a forthcoming pregnancy and so that they could obtain more information about the disease and its inheritance.”


	
	In cross-examination, the respondent gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. The words to the effect of: Well, given your condition, you really need to see a genetic counsellor, Ms Duggan, so that you can be properly informed about the things that you should consider in order to make an informed choice; is that what you meant to convey.

A. Yes.

Q. It was your view that she should be seen by them, so that they can be armed with information as to the effect that the condition could have on their children?

A. I don’t know if that was verbatim, but that was the gist of it.

Q. That is something that you would expect to be said by you in order to make it plain to them why it was they were going off to see her, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. It wouldn’t be sufficient to simply say something along the lines of, ‘Ring Kerry Duggan to discuss Lawrence’s factor III condition’, would it?

A. I wouldn’t expect so.”


	
	The respondent agreed that it was his obligation to give the appellants the opportunity to understand the genetic consequences of ATD and to alter their course towards pregnancy, if they so wished, on the basis of that understanding and for that purpose to refer them to a genetic counsellor. He also accepted that it was desirable for the appellants to have up to date information, as knowledge in this area was in a state of rapid development, particularly where, as was the position in the case of the appellants, there was a question as to fertility and there was a significant possibility that they would undergo IVF treatment. The respondent said that by referring the appellants to Ms Duggan at Wollongong Hospital, he gave them that opportunity.
	
	
	A formal letter of referral for genetic counselling was not necessary for a consultation with Ms Duggan. The respondent’s usual practice was to provide patients with a business card for Ms Duggan. This practice was not the subject of criticism. However, on this occasion, the respondent gave the appellants a post-it note with Ms Duggan’s details, as follows:
	


“GENETIC COUNSELLOR

Kerry Duggan

4xxx xxxx”

The telephone number was that of Wollongong Hospital.


	
	The respondent said that the only reason he could think of for providing Ms Duggan’s details on a post-it note was that he had run out of her business cards. The respondent did not make a note of having referred the appellants to Ms Duggan in the appellants’ patient file.
	
	
	The appellants’ evidence was that there had been no discussion of the hereditary aspects of ATD at the first or any subsequent consultation with the respondent. There was a dispute at trial about what the respondent said when he handed the post-it note to the appellants and whether its purpose was adequately explained. According to the appellants, the matter being discussed at the time the respondent gave them the post-it note was whether the second appellant’s ATD may have caused his infertility. The respondent had told them that that was unlikely, but had said, “[r]ing that lady about that”.
	
	
	The respondent said he was certain that he did not say at the first consultation that there may be a genetic aspect to the second appellant’s infertility. He said he would not have done so without seeing the repeat sperm tests.
	
	
	The trial judge accepted, at [134], that it was probable that the appellants had asked the respondent at the first consultation whether ATD could have caused the second appellant’s infertility. His Honour was also satisfied that had the respondent specified the reason for the referral to a genetic counsellor he would have asked or would have been told that the second appellant had consulted Dr Ramakrishna.
	
	
	The absence of any reference by the appellants to Dr Ramakrishna in their consultations with the respondent confirmed his Honour’s conclusion, at [136], that inheritability issues were not raised at any of the consultations. His Honour added that, even on his own evidence, the explanation the respondent gave the appellants as to the purpose of the genetic counselling fell short of what the respondent himself considered to be adequate.
	
	
	The second appellant said that he rang the telephone number provided for Ms Duggan once, but the phone rang out and he made no further attempt to contact her. The first appellant did not attempt to call the number. The appellants did not inform the respondent that they had not spoken to Ms Duggan and the respondent did not ask them whether contact had been made.
	
	
	The respondent did not receive any correspondence or reports from Ms Duggan, which was usual when he referred patients to her. Nor did the respondent make a note that he had made the referral. He accepted that it was unreasonable not to keep contemporaneous notes to prompt a recollection of a referral.
	


Decision to proceed with IVF


	
	After the first consultation, there were four further consultations with the respondent. It was unclear on the evidence whether the second appellant attended the further consultations. On 28 July 1999, the appellants informed the respondent that they wished to proceed with IVF. On 4 October 1999, they signed a form entitled “Sydney IVF: Request for Treatment Form”, with the procedures “In vitro fertilization + embryo transfer (IVF+ET)” and “Intracytoplasmic sperm insertion (ICSI)” selected from a list of treatment options. The ICSI procedure involved a single sperm being injected directly into an ovum in the laboratory, followed by the fertilised ovum being implanted into the uterus. The signed Request for Treatment form contained the following acknowledgements:
	


“… that there are risks to the procedure(s) as detailed in ‘the pink sheets’ and in the specific written information

that these risks include complications

that the intended outcome might not be achieved.”


	
	“The pink sheets” referred to were a fourteen page document entitled “Detailed Information about IVF and GIFT including Risks, Hazards and Responsibilities”. It outlined some of the risks of abnormalities in children born of IVF, as follows:
	


“If pregnancy occurs then there is a chance that the baby or babies may be born abnormal, as there is with pregnancies after natural conception. With straightforward IVF and GIFT … the risk of significant abnormalities at birth is around 2-3 percent of births.

The risk could be higher (possibly 4 or 5 percent of births) in pregnancies that occur with very extreme male-factor infertility, typically involving the procedure of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).”


	
	In cross-examination, the first appellant acknowledged that she would have read this document in 1999. By reference to the document, she was cross-examined on her understanding of the risks of pregnancy and the ICSI treatment:
	


“Q. You understood at the time that there were always going to be potential risks with any pregnancy?

A. I guess so.

Q. Including risks to the child?

A. I guess so.

…

Q. So you understood at the time that there were potential additional risks if ICSI was used?

A. I guess so.

Q. And you were prepared to accept those risks?

A. Correct.”


	
	The IVF treatment began on 11 November 1999 with ovum being removed from the first appellant. One fertilised embryo implanted into the first appellant’s uterus developed into a successful pregnancy. On 22 December 1999, the first appellant was referred to Dr Hoolahan by the respondent for management of the pregnancy.
	


Keeden’s birth and CSVT


	
	The first appellant presented to the labour ward at 8:30 pm on 9 August 2000. Keeden was delivered the next day at 1 pm. In a letter to the respondent dated 16 August 2000, Dr Hoolahan reported:
	


“[The first appellant’s] recent pregnancy was uncomplicated apart from a low grade rise in blood pressure towards the end which did not require treatment. She went into spontaneous labour at 6 days overdue and had a normal vaginal delivery with a small second degree tear, of a 4045 male and they had no post natal problems whilst in hospital.”


	
	Keeden was discharged at 10:30 am on 14 August 2009. A discharge summary, dated 21 August 2000, stated:
	


“… He was seen by Mark de Souza in the newborn period and checked by him at discharge on the third postnatal day. The baby was making good progress and there was no neurologic abnormality.”


	
	However, the appellants returned to the emergency department of the hospital with Keeden in the early hours of the following day, at 1:08 am. Medical reports indicate that he was jerking while screaming, had twitching movements in the right side of his face and arm and was suffering from seizures. He was taken to Westmead Children’s Hospital. Neuroimaging evidence established that Keeden had suffered an “extensive thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinus system”, which is a type of “Neonatal (or Perinatal) Stroke”.
	
	
	The primary judge’s summary of the medical evidence of possible risk factors for Keedon’s CSVT, at [244], was as follows:
	


“Dehydration - This was one of the most common precipitants of thrombosis. Keeden had borderline hydration. Keeden's degree of weight loss was very common. It was within acceptable limits.

Preeclampsia - It is unclear from the hospital notes how firmly this diagnosis was made. The [first appellant] was really on the edge of the criteria of the diagnosis of preeclampsia. If it was preeclampsia it was extremely mild. It is debatable in any event if preeclampsia is a possible risk factor.

Prolonged second stage of labour - the second stage of labour was two hours 45 minutes. This is within the normal range of 2-3 hours. It is not known if a longer second stage is a risk factor for CSVT. It is plausible though there is not a lot of evidence to support it.

Complication at birth - CSVT has a common association with complicated deliveries. This delivery was not completely normal but it was at the lower end of the complication spectrum.

Foetal distress - the suction etc may be evidence of foetal distress but the five minute Apgar score of 8 probably would be interpreted as evidence that there had not been foetal distress.

Head position - Associate Professor Evans was unsure of any reason head position should be more or less a risk factor.”


	
	Associate Professor Evans, Professor Amor (clinical geneticist) and Professor Monagle (paediatric haematologist) were cross-examined as to whether these complications could be associated with CSVT. Professor Monagle gave evidence, with which Associate Professor Evans agreed, that:
	


“… [T]here are probably multiple events that, combined, lead to a thrombosis, and some of them we will know about and some we won’t know about, and so if you just look at any one of those events in isolation it’s often [hard] to prove a linkage, but the combination, so I think a little bit of preeclampsia, a longer labour, a malposition, some dryness, you know, all of those things combined give you a better set up for getting a thrombosis.”


	
	Mr Kirk, counsel for the respondent, posed the following question to the two experts:
	


“[W]ould it be fair to perhaps summarise it this way: There is no certainty about any of these factors being risk factors for Keeden, but it is possible that these complications of the delivery were contributories [sic] to the CSVT event in Keeden?”

Associate Professor Evans responded:

“Yes. I mean, I think I would agree with all that. Almost certainly in all these cases you’re dealing with multiple factors coming together.”

Professor Monagle also said that he agreed.


	
	In their joint expert report on causation, Associate Professor Evans, Professor Amor and Professor Monagle agreed as to the general risk of thrombosis in neonates or children, as well as the association of that risk with ATD, stating:
	


“We all agree that the risk of symptomatic thrombosis in neonates is extremely low and remains very low during childhood. In 1999, there were less than 10 case reports of thrombosis in neonates that were possibly associated with AT deficiency.”

Challenges to factual findings


	
	It is convenient in the first instance to consider the two factual findings made by the trial judge at [174] and [215] that are subject to challenge: see grounds 2 and 3 of the notice of contention.
	
	
	The first finding, at [174], was that the appellants’ misunderstanding of the inheritability of ATD would have been remedied but for the respondent’s breach in not properly explaining the reason for the referral for genetic counselling and in not following up with the appellants whether they had consulted Ms Duggan. The respondent contended that the appellants’ misunderstanding would not have been corrected, because even had the breach not occurred, he would have discovered and accepted the appellants’ erroneous understanding of Dr Ramakrishna’s advice, and that would have been the end of the matter.
	
	
	The second challenged finding, at [215], was “that properly informed [the appellants] would have elected not to have Keeden”. The respondent contended that if the appellants had obtained further appropriate genetic advice, they would still have decided to proceed with the IVF treatment at the time they did.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the objective circumstances relating to the factual findings under challenge were as follows. The second appellant was diagnosed with ATD in 1988 after suffering a pulmonary embolism. He was aware his mother had had clots and that therefore the condition could run in families. Notwithstanding that he had been concerned and shocked by his diagnosis, the second appellant continued to do jobs involving hard manual labour, having taken the view that such jobs only required him to take precautions. He did not follow the directions of his doctor to have monthly blood tests, as he said he got to know his body and how the medication worked. He continued surfing, notwithstanding that it was a surfing incident that had led to the pulmonary embolism in 1988.
	
	
	The appellants had been actively trying to conceive since February 1998 and were anxious to have children. Prior to February 1998, they had used contraceptives, which the second appellant conceded was not “100% safe”. Once they realised they were having difficulty with conception, they promptly sought advice and assistance from a fertility doctor and were prepared to undergo IVF treatment.
	
	
	The second appellant did not seek advice as to the inheritability of ATD until December 1997 when he consulted a locum GP, Dr Miller, who referred him to Dr Ramakrishna. The second appellant misunderstood the information provided. Neither appellant sought updated information in respect of the inheritability of ATD between the second appellant’s consultation with Dr Ramakrishna and their first consultation with the respondent in March 1999.
	
	
	The respondent was not a geneticist, but was aware of the condition of ATD and that it may have a genetic element. The expert evidence of Dr O’Loughlin and Professor Saunders was that the respondent could not reasonably be expected to have expertise in relation to the precise mode of inheritance of ATD. The respondent knew of Dr Ramakrishna and believed him to be an experienced haematologist.
	


Consideration of the first finding


	
	The respondent accepted that, on the objective evidence, had he taken the steps the trial judge held, at [124], he should have taken, he would have come to know that the second appellant had consulted Dr Ramakrishna. Those steps included inquiring of the appellants as to their knowledge of the inheritability of ATD and the source of that knowledge: see below at [139]. He contended that this would have occurred either at the initial consultation in the course of explaining the purpose of the referral to a genetic counsellor, or in following up whether the appellants had seen Ms Duggan. In the latter case, he submitted that he would have asked why they had not done so. In either case, it was likely that the second appellant would have explained that he already had advice from Dr Ramakrishna.
	
	
	There was a basis in the evidence for this submission, as the second appellant agreed that if the respondent had asked whether the appellants had been to see Ms Duggan, and if not, why they had not, the second appellant would have told the respondent that he had seen a haematologist, Dr Ramakrishna, about his condition. He further said that if asked as to what Dr Ramakrishna had said, he would have responded that he had been told that both he and his wife needed to have the same condition for ATD to be inherited by their children.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the critical issue was the probable course of events after the respondent had ascertained that the appellants had already sought and received advice from Dr Ramakrishna. He contended that on the evidence, had that point been reached, no further action would have been taken.
	
	
	However, the respondent’s challenge to the first finding overlooks his own evidence in which he conceded that the appellants “needed” to have up-to-date information. He qualified this statement by saying that it depended what had happened in the period between seeing Dr Ramakrishna and the date of the consultation with him. However, that qualification is of little import in circumstances where the respondent did not have any relevant knowledge of the condition to know whether there had been any updated information and he knew that this was an area where medical knowledge was changing rapidly.
	
	
	Further, the respondent agreed that had the appellants told him that the second appellant had, a year previously, been to see Dr Ramakrishna, whom the respondent knew, he would probably have telephoned Dr Ramakrishna. It is likely therefore that on speaking to Dr Ramakrishna he would have discovered the appellants’ misunderstanding.
	
	
	In my opinion, the respondent has not established that this finding was wrong, or that the finding of fact for which he contended ought to be made.
	


Consideration of the second finding


	
	The respondent acknowledged that the appellants’ evidence that they would not have had Keeden had they been in possession of the correct information as to the inheritability of ATD was admissible and that his Honour had appropriately exercised caution in determining the weight to be given to that evidence. The respondent further accepted that his Honour had correctly approached the fact finding exercise as to the appellants’ subjective intentions by reference to the objective circumstances: Rosenberg v Percival [2001] HCA 18; 205 CLR 434 at [89]. That being so, the respondent submitted that this Court did not suffer the disadvantage of not having seen and heard the witnesses and could thus engage in the fact finding process without the usual restraint that an appellate court exercises in relation to the factual findings of a trial judge: see Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [22]-[25].
	
	
	His Honour made the finding at [215] after considering matters that could be objectively determined as well as matters that were subjective to the appellants. Where his Honour considered that evidence as to subjective matters was undermined in cross-examination, he said so. Nonetheless, his Honour accepted the appellants’ evidence that they would not have proceeded with IVF when they did, notwithstanding the objective circumstances to which the respondent directed attention.
	
	
	In those circumstances and giving full weight to the obligation of this Court in an appeal governed by the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 75A and the principles stated in Fox v Percy, the respondent has not established a basis to interfere with his Honour’s finding at [215].
	
	
	Accordingly, I would reject grounds 2 and 3 of the respondent’s notice of contention.
	


Content and scope of the duty of care


	
	Although the appellants chose to advance their argument on the appeal by first considering the issue of causation, questions of causation require, as a preceding step, the determination of the nature, scope and content of the duty of care the respondent owed to the appellants. Accordingly, I consider it not only appropriate but necessary first to consider the content and scope of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellant: see Kuhl v Zurich [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361 at [19] and [20].
	
	
	The trial judge made findings that the respondent owed a duty of care of a specific content: at [91]-[92]; see also at [257]. His Honour separately made a finding that the harm suffered did not fall within the scope of the duty of care that the respondent owed to the appellants: judgment at [263]. Given the separate consideration his Honour gave to the content and the scope of the duty of care, I propose to use the language of “content” when considering the challenge to his Honour’s findings at [91]-[92] and [257].
	
	
	I have done so notwithstanding the use of the language “scope of duty” in the respondent’s challenge to the finding at [91]-[92] and [257] in ground 1 of the his notice of contention, and more particularly, notwithstanding that the High Court authorities use the language of “content” and “scope” interchangeably: see Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 discussed below. In Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; 223 CLR 422 Gummow J observed, at [58], that the essential issue on the appeal in that case was the “content of the duty of care”. At [97] his Honour found that the trial judge in that case had “erred in merging the question of the scope or content of the duty of care and the question of breach”.
	


Trial judge’s findings on content of the duty of care


	
	On the approach taken by his Honour, an important consideration in determining the content of the duty of care was the fact that the respondent did not have the primary duty to advise the appellants on hereditary issues. However, the respondent knew that the second appellant had ATD and that it was possible that a child of the appellants might inherit the condition. His Honour, at [88], considered that the evidence of Dr O’Loughlin and Professor Saunders supported the existence of a duty of care to ensure that the appellants were adequately informed and understood the hereditary aspects of ATD or had decided for themselves that they did not require that information, and that this involved a duty to follow up the referral to Ms Duggan.
	
	
	In that context, his Honour, at [91], found that the duty of care owed to the appellants was:
	


“… to ascertain if [the appellants] were aware that ATD was potentially inheritable; to explain to [the appellants] the purpose of the proposed referral [to a genetic counsellor]; to properly refer [the appellants] to an appropriate person for the obtaining of the [genetic] information subject to [the appellants’] agreement … to ascertain if such consultation had taken place and if not to make further inquiry as to the reason why the consultation had not occurred and to reinforce the reasons why it would be desirable to consult with the genetic consultant or a geneticist.”


	
	His Honour’s findings at [92] and [257] were to the same effect.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept that the respondent’s duty of care included a duty to raise with the appellants the possibility of using donor sperm as a means of potentially avoiding transmission of ATD to a child they might conceive, as the appellants had alleged at trial. The appellants did not challenge that aspect of his Honour’s judgment.
	
	
	His Honour dealt with “scope of duty” at [262]-[263] by reference to the harm claimed to have been suffered. He considered harm in the terms framed by the appellants, namely, economic loss associated with having, raising and caring for Keeden, and physical injury, including psychological damage. His Honour accepted the respondent’s submission that harm of that type was consequent upon Keeden suffering permanent physical disability as a result of the CSVT.
	
	
	His Honour held, at [263], that such matters were not within the scope of the respondent’s duty of care, as damage of the nature claimed was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the acts and omissions alleged against the respondent. His Honour reiterated that the respondent’s breach concerned a failure to cause information to be obtained in relation to ATD. However, the harm suffered by the appellants was caused by an event which was not reasonably foreseeable. In this regard, his Honour accepted the unchallenged evidence of Professor Monagle who said:
	


“If you are asking me whether in 1999, there was any way to predict that the paternal AT … deficiency may have led to the clinical outcome for Keeden Waller, I am very clear that the answer is no, based on all the information provided in this and my primary report.”


	
	His Honour concluded that the harm suffered by the appellants was not within the scope of the overall duty owed by the respondent.
	


Submissions


	
	The respondent challenged his Honour’s findings as to the content of the duty of care. He made no challenge to his Honour’s finding of scope of the duty of care which was in his favour, accepting as correct the proposition that the scope of the duty was dependent on the foreseeability of the harm suffered. That harm, as the trial judge accepted, arose from Keeden suffering CSVT, or, put more generically, from the general risks of pregnancy, including CSVT, which were independent of any genetic condition.
	
	
	The respondent contended that a duty of the content found by his Honour did not exist. He relied upon the terms of the letter of referral, set out above at [25], namely, that the “problem” for which the first appellant was referred was “fertility assistance”. Central to his submission was that the nature of the harm suffered was not within the scope of the duty of care he owed to the appellants. He contended that, as a fertility expert, his duty was to warn of the risks of pregnancy and it was not alleged that he had failed to do so.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that a duty of care with the content found by his Honour would be novel and the appellants had failed to establish that the case fell within the parameters for determining whether a duty of care arose in novel circumstances, discussed in Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Limited v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649 at [102] ff.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that a duty of care of this content would make him an insurer against all the consequences of a successful pregnancy and birth. The respondent accepted that it was consistent with his obligations to refer the appellants to a genetic counsellor, not so as to ascertain whether ATD was a cause of the second appellant’s infertility but so as to enable the appellants to understand the effect of the condition on any child they might have. This in turn would place them in the position to make an informed choice in respect of having children: see [30]-[34].
	
	
	However, the respondent submitted that the primary judge gave undue weight to the opinions of the experts, which he contended were of limited significance because the case did not concern technical, operative or clinical matters, and that a duty to take steps to ensure that the appellants received genetic advice would be indeterminate in scope and unreasonable. He pointed out that there were differing views amongst the experts as to whether a patient should be referred for genetic counselling and that Professor Saunders and Dr O’Loughlin, whose evidence the trial judge accepted, recognised that there could not be an obligation to refer every patient for genetic counselling. The respondent submitted that these factors strongly militated against the imposition of such a duty on doctors who advise on fertility or pregnancy.
	
	
	The appellants submitted that the respondent’s submissions sought inappropriately to narrow his role in his dealing with them. They submitted that the respondent had assumed general control over the process as to whether they would proceed with IVF. They contended that in the circumstances, the respondent’s duty of care included advising of the risks associated with IVF/ICSI and providing treatment in such a way that the risks of an abnormal child were avoided or minimised so that the parents could avoid undertaking risks of abnormalities that were unacceptable to them. It was part of that duty to coordinate any tests and referrals required.
	
	
	The appellants pointed to aspects of the respondent’s evidence that supported the finding that it was within the scope of his duty to refer them to a genetic counsellor and to follow up whether they had obtained the advice. This included the respondent’s own opinion that the appellants should be referred to a genetic counsellor, and his statement that, had he learned that they had not seen Ms Duggan, he would have made it clear that they needed to discuss ATD with her.
	
	
	The terms in which the appellants, in the case at trial, framed the harm they had suffered were set out above at [79]. On the appeal, however, the appellants’ senior counsel put the case in different terms. He submitted that the “right that [the appellants] had to which the breach of duty related [was] the right to plan their family”. As I understood the submission, it was damage to this “right” by the breach identified by his Honour that was the harm they sustained giving rise to their claim for damages. This is apparent from the balance of the submission, where senior counsel contended that the harm being thus identified, the appellants were entitled to damages. The submission was in the following terms:
	


“The damages that we seek in that regard of course are, as outlined in the judgment, is that the pain and suffering of [the first appellant] bearing the child Keeden; secondly, economic loss; and thirdly, the cost of rearing the child. The cost of the rearing of the child, we say, arises from the right to choose whether someone as parents want to take on the legal and moral responsibility of caring for a child. That is at the heart of the right, particularly with respect to the third head of damage.”

This submission was founded on the decision of the High Court in Cattanach v Melchior which will be considered below at [103]-[112].

Legal principles

Duty of a medical practitioner


	
	The respondent did not dispute that he owed a duty of care to the appellants to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment, both pursuant to an implied contractual term and in tort: Rogers v Whitaker [1992] HCA 58; 175 CLR 479 at 483, 489; Breen v Williams [1996] HCA 57; 186 CLR 71 at 78; Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375 at [8]. That duty is a single comprehensive duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment. In Rogers v Whitaker it was held that a component of that duty is a duty to warn a patient of material risks: at 490. The duty extends to the provision of information in an appropriate case: Rogers v Whitaker at 483.
	
	
	In Rosenberg v Percival, Gummow J, despite noting at [61] that the relevant risk of harm against which a medical practitioner was required to warn was not “that the patient will make an uninformed decision or choose the wrong option”, recognised that “that may well underpin the rationale behind the duty”. See also F v R (1983) 33 SASR 189 at 192 where King CJ observed that “the purpose of disclosure is to provide the patient with the information necessary to enable [the patient] to make informed decisions concerning [the patient’s] future”.
	
	
	The underlying policy in the recognition of a duty to warn in a doctor-patient relationship was again referred to in Wallace v Kam at [8], where the Court explained that:
	


“The policy underlying the imposition of [the duty to warn] is to equip the patient with information relevant to the choice that is the patient’s to make. The duty to inform the patient of inherent material risks is imposed to enable the patient to choose whether or not to run those inherent risks and thereby ‘to avoid the occurrence of the particular physical injury the risk of which [the] patient is not prepared to accept’.”


	
	The Court further observed, at [36]:
	


“The duty of a medical practitioner to warn the patient of material risks inherent in a proposed treatment is imposed by reference to the underlying common law right of the patient to choose whether or not to undergo a proposed treatment. However, the policy that underlies requiring the exercise of reasonable care and skill in the giving of that warning is neither to protect that right to choose nor to protect the patient from exposure to all unacceptable risks. The underlying policy is rather to protect the patient from the occurrence of physical injury the risk of which is unacceptable to the patient.” (emphasis added)

Formulation of the content of a particular duty


	
	As Gummow J pointed out in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (in relation to what I have characterised for the purpose of these reasons as the content of the duty) at [43]:
	


“… duties of care are not owed in the abstract. Rather, they are obligations of a particular scope, and that scope may be more or less expansive depending on the relationship in question.”


	
	The following observation of French CJ and Gummow J in Kuhl v Zurich at [21] is also pertinent (albeit that their Honours were in dissent in the outcome, this observation was not inconsistent with the reasons of the majority):
	


“… the formulated duty must neither be so broad as to be devoid of meaningful content, nor so narrow as to obscure the issues required for consideration.”


	
	Their Honours noted, however, at [22]:
	


“… a duty formulated at too high a level of abstraction may leave unanswered the critical questions respecting the content of the term ‘reasonable’ and hence the content of the duty of care.”


	
	Gummow J in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer and French CJ and Gummow J in Kuhl v Zurich referred to the observation of the Court in Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; 207 CLR 562, at [50], that:
	


“Different classes of case give rise to different problems in determining the existence and nature or scope, of a duty of care. Sometimes the problems may be bound up with the harm suffered by the plaintiff, as, for example, where its direct cause is the criminal conduct of some third party. Sometimes they may arise because the defendant is the repository of a statutory power or discretion. Sometimes they may reflect the difficulty of confining the class of persons to whom a duty may be owed within reasonable limits. Sometimes they may concern the need to preserve the coherence of other legal principles, or of a statutory scheme which governs certain conduct or relationships. The relevant problem will then become the focus of attention in a judicial evaluation of the factors which tend for or against a conclusion, to be arrived at as a matter of principle.” (citations omitted)

The Court in Sullivan v Moody also used the language of “scope of duty” in the context of what I have described in these reasons as the “content of the duty”.


	
	As this passage demonstrates, leaving aside cases of a well-settled duty, such as that owed by a motorist to another road user or a doctor to a patient, there is no single approach to the identification of the scope of the duty save that it is likely to be fact sensitive. Thus, in Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; 205 CLR 254 Hayne J observed, at [103]:
	


“In Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman [(1985) 157 CLR 424], Brennan J pointed out that ‘a postulated duty of care must be stated in reference to the kind of damage that a plaintiff has suffered and in reference to the plaintiff or a class of which the plaintiff is a member’. Ordinarily it may be expected that it will be sufficient to state the duty of care by reference to these two matters: the kind of damage suffered and the class of which the plaintiff is a member. Even that, however, may not suffice in some cases.” (citation omitted)


	
	In Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre v Anzil Gleeson CJ, at [14]-[15], and Hayne J, at [105], found it useful, in a case where the existence of the duty of care did not fall into a well-established category of negligence, to begin the consideration of that question by reference to the harm suffered for which the defendant was said to be liable and the particular want of care alleged. See similarly Harriton v Stephens [2006] HCA 15; 226 CLR 52 at [225]; Caltex Refineries (Qld) v Stavar at [103] per Allsop P; Sullivan v Moody at [50]; Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer at [59] per Gummow J. Although the question in this case is not the existence of a duty of care but its content, I consider the same approach should be taken.
	
	
	Harm or damage, in this sense, is different from the damages which flow from it: Cattanach v Melchior at [23] per Gleeson CJ. McHugh and Gummow JJ observed, at [67]:
	


“In the law of negligence, damage is either physical injury to person or property or the suffering of a loss measurable in money terms or the incurring of expenditure as the result of the invasion of an interest recognised by the law.”


	
	In Harriton v Stephens, Crennan J observed, at [225]:
	


“A right of action and a duty of care are inseparable. In a case like this, the existence and extent of a duty of care can usefully be considered by reference to the nature of the damage suffered because a cardinal principle of imposing liability for negligence in novel circumstances is that the party complained of should owe to the party complaining a duty to take care, which the law can recognise as a matter of principle, and that the party complaining should be able to prove that actual loss or damage has been suffered as a consequence of a breach of that duty. Proving that actual loss or damage has been suffered requires proof of interference with a right or interest recognised as capable of protection by law.” (citations omitted)


	
	It is necessary, having regard to these authorities, to consider in some detail the nature of the harm alleged to have been suffered by the appellants, as outlined above at [79]. This requires, first, an analysis of the High Court’s decision in Cattanach v Melchior.
	


The harm identified in Cattanach v Melchior


	
	The only issue in Cattanach v Melchior was whether damages for the costs of raising the child were recoverable, that being the only question on which special leave to appeal was granted. Duty of care, breach and damage were all conceded and, because of the limited basis of leave, causation and remoteness were not in issue: see at [51]. The plaintiffs in Cattanach v Melchoir had an unplanned child following a sterilisation procedure due to negligent advice and a failure to warn. By majority, the court (McHugh and Gummow JJ, Kirby J and Callinan J) held that the damages claimed for the upkeep of the child were recoverable. The minority (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ) each rejected the claim.
	
	
	Although the question with which the Court was concerned was whether the damages claimed were recoverable, McHugh and Gummow JJ, at [66], nonetheless characterised the interest that the law protected as “that of each of the respondents in the planning of their family”. Their Honours observed that “the injury to that interest had varied elements”, including the costs of rearing the child they had conceived as the result of the failed sterilisation procedure. Their Honours stated, at [67]-[68], that the harm or damage was not the coming into existence of the parent-child relationship, nor was the harm the unborn child. Rather, it was “the burden of the legal and moral responsibilities which arise by reason of the birth of the child”. Their Honours did not consider it of assistance to characterise the expenditure required to discharge that obligation as economic loss: see at [66].
	
	
	Gleeson CJ, at [19], considered the claim was for pure economic loss. His Honour considered that the legal and moral responsibility resulting from the parent-child relationship, and not Mr and Mrs Melchior’s “right to choose” the size of their family, formed the basis of the claim: see at [5] and at [23]-[26]. His Honour, at [23], saw that “right” as being more precisely understood as Mr and Mrs Melchior having a “freedom to make such a choice”. Importantly, however, as his Honour also observed at [23], the harm or loss claimed must be one that is capable of protection by the law, or, as he stated at [30], Mr and Mrs Melchior had to show that Dr Cattanach’s duty of care “extended to a duty of care to protect them from that kind of loss or harm”. His Honour quoted the statement of Brennan J in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman at [27]: see above at [98], that a duty of care must be stated in reference to the kind of damage suffered, as well as Brennan J’s further statement, at [28], that:
	


“The question is always whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of any duty to avoid or prevent it.”


	
	Gleeson CJ, at [32]-[38], rejected the claim on the basis that it did not satisfy the criteria for a claim for economic loss considered in Perre v Apand [1999] HCA 36; 198 CLR 180.
	
	
	Callinan J considered, at [302], that the claim was for pure economic loss. His Honour considered that although that categorisation was imprecise, it was “reasonable in the circumstances” for the purposes of determining the claim.
	
	
	In the course of his judgment, at [213], Hayne J referred to the observation of Lord Slynn in McFarlane v Tayside Health Board [2000] 2 AC 59, another failed sterilisation case, that the doctor in that case, albeit negligent, had not assumed responsibility for the expense of rearing the child. Hayne J’s rejection of the claim was essentially based on policy grounds: see especially at [255]-[260].
	
	
	Kirby J, at [149], considered that the loss was not pure economic loss, particularly as the mother had been awarded damages for the pain and suffering relating to the pregnancy and birth and the effects of the pregnancy on her health. His Honour considered that the father’s claim “was made concrete by the physical injury suffered by the mother” and that it was artificial to sever the parents’ claim for the costs of rearing the child.
	
	
	Heydon J, in dissent, noted, at [347], the difficulties of an award of damages:
	


“… in circumstances where what has happened is incapable of characterisation as a loss [because] the impact of a new life in a family is incapable of estimation in money terms.”


	
	His Honour also considered that the majority approach would have the problematic effect of encouraging parents to exaggerate the costs and minimise the benefits of their children, and would generate litigation about children capable of causing them distress and injury.
	
	
	It was not submitted that the harm, in this case, was the parent-child relationship or the coming into existence of that relationship. However, the claimed harm, articulated in the terms set out above at [79], gains support from the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ. As the balance of the appellants’ submission demonstrates, the significant aspect of their claim was for economic loss resulting from an interference with the appellants’ right to plan their family. It is therefore necessary to consider the principles relating to such loss.
	


Principles relating to economic loss


	
	In Perre v Apand the factors upon which a claim for economic loss depend were considered by the High Court. Gummow J, at [192], observed that the inquiry commenced with the identification of “the interests for which [the plaintiffs] sought protection”. However, as his Honour pointed out, at [198], there is “no simple formula” and whether a claim will be recognised is dependent on the “particular connections between the parties”. His Honour adopted the approach taken by Stephen J in Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dredge ‘Willemstad’ [1976] HCA 65; 136 CLR 529, stating, at [201], it was necessary to consider “the ‘salient features’ which combined to constitute a sufficiently close relationship to give rise to a duty of care”.
	
	
	McHugh J observed, at [131]:
	


“The cases have recognised that knowledge, actual or constructive, of the defendant that its act will harm the plaintiff is virtually a prerequisite of a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss. Negligence at common law is still a fault based system. It would offend current community standards to impose liability on a defendant for acts or omissions which he or she could not apprehend would damage the interests of another.” (citations omitted)

See similarly Crimmins v Stevedoring Committee [1999] HCA 59; 200 CLR 1, at [101] per McHugh J.


	
	It follows from the observations of Brennan J in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman, considered above at [98], that foreseeability is directed to the harm or damage of the kind that the plaintiff has suffered.
	
	
	In Perre v Apand the factors relevant to the determination of that question were identified by the court as foresight of the likelihood of harm, knowledge or means of knowledge of an ascertainable class of vulnerable persons who were unable to protect themselves from harm, the fact that imposing a duty of care did not impair the legitimate commercial interests of the wrongdoer and the fact that the damage flowed from the occurrence of activities within the wrongdoer’s control. Apart from the question of foreseeability these factors do not have to co-exist. As Gummow J observed, regard is to be had to the salient features of the case.
	
	
	In Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15; 164 CLR 539 Gaudron J, at 601, likewise stated that it will almost always be necessary in an action for economic loss to identify the interest said to have been infringed. This passage was endorsed in Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees [2013] HCA 10; 247 CLR 613 by the plurality (French CJ, Hayne and Kiefel JJ) who stated, at [25], that an understanding of the interest said to be infringed was necessary, relevantly:
	


“… for a proper understanding of the harm suffered and for the determination of what acts or omissions may be said to have caused that damage.”


	
	In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55; 175 CLR 514, the plurality (Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) observed that economic loss may take a variety of forms. Relevantly to this case, their Honours stated that:
	


“The kind of economic loss which is sustained and the time when it is first sustained depend upon the nature of the interest infringed and, perhaps, the nature of the interference to which it is subjected. With economic loss, as with other forms of damage, there has to be some actual damage.” (citations omitted)


	
	In Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees, at [28], the plurality noted that an interest that is the subject of economic loss need not be derived from proprietary rights or obligations governed by the general law. In Hill v Van Erp [1997] HCA 9; 188 CLR 159 the loss of a mere expectation interest was held to be recoverable. An interest infringed could be the value of property, as was the case in Kenny and Good v MGICA [1999] HCA 25; 199 CLR 413. In Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees the harm the respondent suffered was its inability to recover monies it had lent pursuant to a void loan agreement.
	


The English cases


	
	Whilst the parties did not seek to develop the legal principles upon which they relied by reference to authority in other jurisdictions, the relevant issues here have been extensively considered by the English courts and a brief consideration of the English authorities is warranted.
	
	
	At the time that the High Court decided Cattanach v Melchior, the House of Lords had rejected a similar claim in a failed sterilisation case in McFarlane v Tayside Health Board. Lord Slynn at 76, Lord Steyne at 83-84 and Lord Hope at 89 characterised the costs of bringing up the child as pure economic loss. A claim for the upkeep of a child after a failed sterilisation procedure was similarly refused in Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHS Trust [2004] 1 AC 309. In that case, the plaintiff, who was severely visually handicapped, underwent a sterilisation procedure as she considered that her disability would prevent her from properly looking after any child she otherwise might have.
	
	
	The outcome in Rees was slightly different from that in McFarlane in that a sum, £15,000, was awarded by way of general damages for the infringement of the claimant’s right to limit her family. The basis of this award was explained by Lord Millett at [123], as follows:
	


“I still regard the proper outcome in all these cases is to award the parents a modest conventional sum by way of general damages, not for the birth of the child, but for the denial of an important aspect of [the parents’] personal autonomy, viz the right to limit the size of their family. This is an important aspect of human dignity, which is increasingly being regarded as an important human right which should be protected by law. The loss of this right is not an abstract or theoretical one … whether characterized as a right or a freedom, [it] is a proper subject for compensation by way of damages.”


	
	Lord Bingham, at [8], observed that such a “conventional award”:
	


“… would not be, and would not be intended to be, compensatory. It would not be the product of calculation. But it would not be a nominal, let alone derisory, award. It would afford some measure of recognition of the wrong done. And it would afford a more ample measure of justice than the pure McFarlane rule.”


	
	More recently, in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11, the Supreme Court was concerned with the duty of a doctor towards a patient in relation to advice about treatment. In that case, the patient sought damages on behalf of her son who was born with severe disabilities following a difficult birth. The alleged negligence was the failure to give advice about a particular risk, namely shoulder dystocia that would be involved in a vaginal birth and of the alternative possibility of elective caesarean section. The claim was upheld.
	
	
	The plurality, at [73], accepted as correct the approach of the High Court in Rogers v Whitaker in relation to the duty to warn of risks. Their Lordships noted that:
	


“The doctor’s duty of care takes its precise content from the needs, concerns and circumstances of the individual patient to the extent that they are or ought to be known to the doctor.”


	
	Relevantly in relation to the question presently under discussion, their Lordships, at [82], recognised that a doctor’s duty of care to warn of material risks inherent in a treatment option was best understood:
	


“… as a duty of care to avoid exposing a person to a risk of injury which [the patient] would otherwise have avoided, but it is also the counterpart of the patient’s entitlement to decide whether or not to incur that risk.”


	
	The UK Supreme Court also dealt with the question of causation, again by reference to Australian case law, noting at [98] that the issue of causation, where an undisclosed risk has materialised, is closely tied to the identification of the particular risk that ought to have been disclosed. The unequivocal evidence in that case was that had the risk of shoulder dystocia been disclosed, the patient would have chosen a caesarean section.
	
	
	These cases demonstrate the acceptance accorded to a person’s right to choose whether or not to incur a particular risk of treatment. As the UK Supreme Court pointed out in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board that right or entitlement is what underlies or underpins the duty of care.
	


Consideration


	
	In my opinion, the appellants, in identifying the “right to plan their family”, were in fact identifying the interest said to have been infringed: see Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees at [119] above. Although they claimed “damages” flowing from the infringement of that right, their claim was for economic loss, namely, the cost of raising Keeden. That is to be distinguished from the amount they claim they should be awarded to compensate them for that loss. They additionally claimed damages for the “pain and suffering” of bearing the child and damages for a range of psychological and physical consequences each has suffered. These include, in the case of the first appellant, back, shoulder, neck and elbow pain and osteoarthritis in both knees, due to the strain of lifting and moving Keeden. I will return to these aspects of the claim later in these reasons.
	
	
	Having regard to the views of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Cattanach v Melchior and subject to the question of foreseeability as well as to the questions of causation and remoteness of damage, I am prepared to accept that the interest said to be infringed is capable of protection by the law such as to permit a claim for economic loss and that the scope of the respondent’s duty extended to it.
	
	
	That the law would recognise an interest of that kind is consistent with the underlying rationale for the recognition of actionable negligence in the case of a doctor’s failure to warn, diagnose or treat: see above at [90]-[93]. As was noted in Wallace v Kam at [36], the underlying policy of the law is to protect the patient from the occurrence of injury, the risk of which is unacceptable to the patient. Wallace v Kam was a failure to warn case and involved physical injury to the patient. The appellants did not advance their argument in this case in terms of a failure to warn as such. Nor is this a case of direct physical injury to the appellants. The personal injury suffered by the appellants has been the result of the extremely onerous task of caring for Keeden. However, as was recognised in Rosenberg v Percival, the duty of a medical practitioner includes a duty to provide relevant information. Inherent in that aspect of the duty is the provision of information so as to put the patient in a position to make informed choices as to whether to undertake the treatment proposed.
	
	
	In my opinion, the respondent’s duty of care in this case extended to the provision of information to the appellants relating to the importance of seeking genetic counselling and arguably to follow up with them as to whether they had done so. Subject to that reservation, upon which I comment further below at [137], I therefore agree with his Honour’s findings relating to the content of the duty and would dismiss ground 1 of the appellants’ notice of appeal. That does not mean, however, that they have made out their claim to damages.
	


A novel case?


	
	Having come to the conclusion that a claim for economic loss may be made for infringement of a right to plan a family, it is not necessary independently to approach the matter as if it was a novel case. Even if that was thought to be necessary, novel cases are decided by reference to existing principle as the various considerations to which Allsop P referred in Caltex Refineries (Qld) v Stavar demonstrate. Thus, his Honour’s reference to the nature of the harm suffered as being one of the considerations to which regard is to be had requires, in accordance with ordinary principles of negligence, the identification of reasonably foreseeable harm. In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35; 211 CLR 317 at [12], Gleeson CJ said:
	


“A necessary, although not sufficient, condition of the existence of a legal duty of care is reasonable foreseeability of the kind of injury that has been suffered by the person to whom the duty is owed ... It is important that ‘reasonable foreseeability’ should be understood and applied with due regard to the consideration that, in the context of an issue as to duty of care, it is bound up with the question whether it is reasonable to require a person to have in contemplation the risk of injury that has eventuated.”


	
	Other factors to which Allsop P, at [103], referred included:
	


“(c)   the degree and nature of control able to be exercised by the defendant to avoid harm;

(d)   the degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to harm from the defendant’s conduct, including the capacity and reasonable expectation of a plaintiff to take steps to protect itself;

…

(f)   any assumption of responsibility by the defendant;

(g)   …

(i)   the nature of the activity undertaken by the defendant;

(j)   …

(k)   knowledge (either actual or constructive) by the defendant that the conduct will cause harm to the plaintiff;

(l)   any potential indeterminacy of liability.”


	
	These factors are well known and mostly self-explanatory. However, a deeper understanding of vulnerability is warranted. In this regard, reference is usually made to the observations of McHugh J in Perre v Apand, a case involving economic loss:
	


“124   Vulnerability will often include, but not be synonymous with, concepts of reliance and assumption of responsibility. …

125   In my view, reliance and assumption of responsibility are merely indicators of the plaintiff's vulnerability to harm from the defendant’s conduct, and it is the concept of vulnerability rather than these evidentiary indicators which is the relevant criterion for determining whether a duty of care exists. …

126   Reliance may therefore be seen - for the purposes of duty of care - as an indicator of vulnerability: the plaintiff is specially vulnerable to the words and/or conduct of the defendant because he or she reasonably relied on the defendant. Reliance may also, of course, be relevant to causation. In terms of a duty of care, however, it is not reliance that is relevant, but its consequence, vulnerability. That is so, even though in certain situations ‘reasonable reliance’ will be the appropriate test for determining whether the plaintiff was vulnerably exposed to harm from the defendant’s acts or omissions.” (citations omitted)


	
	The appellants in this case were vulnerable in the sense that they were under the professional care of an IVF specialist and were dependent upon him for all aspects of treatment, including providing them with relevant information. This included information as to the importance of understanding genetic factors before undertaking IVF treatment. They were reliant upon the respondent to provide them with that information. This was so, notwithstanding that they already had information from Dr Ramakrishna, misunderstood by them, as to the inheritability of ATD. The respondent knew or ought to have known that his conduct, being a failure adequately to explain the purpose of the referral and a failure to follow up with the appellants as to whether they had had genetic counselling could, at the least, impact on their decision as to whether to proceed with IVF.
	
	
	The factors to which I have referred, at [133]-[134], would tend to support the existence of a duty of care in the terms claimed. In short, the respondent had a duty to impart relevant information, including in relation to genetic counselling and had, in fact, assumed responsibility to do so, notwithstanding that the respondent was not a genetic specialist. By referring them to a genetic counsellor, he assumed the responsibility of providing sufficient information to the appellants so that they understood the reasons for and the importance of obtaining genetic counselling. It may be that as a matter of good practice, he ought to have followed up with the appellants as to whether they had done so. However, with or without that aspect of the content of the duty, I consider that the appellants otherwise established a duty of care in the terms found by the trial judge.
	


Breach of duty of care

Trial judge’s reasons


	
	The trial judge, having found that the respondent owed the appellants a duty of care, considered the question of breach of duty of care before dealing with scope of duty. His Honour commenced his consideration of breach by reference to the time honoured statement in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12; 146 CLR 40 at 47, which he set out in full at [117] of his reasons. His Honour also referred to the judgment of King CJ in Gover v South Australia & Perram (1985) 39 SASR 543 at 558, in which his Honour observed that the duty of a medical practitioner was to act reasonably in the circumstances. Those circumstances included a fair appraisal of the patient’s intelligence, temperament and apparent understanding, made having regard to the nature of the recommendation being made. The duty did not extend to a requirement that all advice be put in writing.
	
	
	His Honour, at [124], considered that the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellants required the following:
	


“[The respondent] should have inquired of [the appellants], as to whether they had knowledge as to the inheritability of ATD and, if so, the nature of the knowledge, its source and date. He should have informed them clearly and firmly of the purpose of referral and its desirability. He should have enquired whether they wished to be referred to a genetic consultant or geneticist for appropriate information. These matters would have involved a simple inquiry and explanation during the first consultation. They would have involved no expense, difficulty or inconvenience.”


	
	His Honour held, at [144], that the respondent did not raise with the appellants the potential inheritability of ATD and did not adequately explain to them the purpose of the referral to Ms Duggan, with the consequence that the appellants did not seek to contact Ms Duggan after the failure of their first attempt to do so.
	
	
	His Honour considered that in the absence of an adequate explanation for the referral, the use of the post-it note suggested to the appellants that the referral was less important than, for example, the formal referrals for blood and semen tests. However, as his Honour remarked, at [150], the post-it note achieved its purpose, as the second appellant telephoned Ms Duggan, albeit without making contact. His Honour considered, at [151], that “the problem” was in the respondent’s failure to explain the reasons for the referral, not in giving the appellants the contact details for the genetic counselling on a post-it note.
	


Submissions


	
	The only specific challenge to his Honour’s findings as to breach was to his conclusion that there had been no breach of duty in the respondent only providing a post-it note to the appellants containing Ms Duggan’s details. The appellants pointed out that this finding was contrary to the expert evidence, which was to the effect that the preferred form of referral was in writing or by phone. Further, they submitted that, in the context of the respondent’s failure to adequately explain the purpose of the referral, the post-it note suggested that the referral was unimportant.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that there was no breach of his duty of care in only giving to the appellants the post-it note containing Ms Duggan’s details. He contended that the expert evidence was not without ambiguity. He submitted that in any event, the post-it note constituted an adequate form of referral.
	


Consideration


	
	In my opinion, there was no error in his Honour’s conclusion that the referral by way of a post-it note did not constitute a breach of duty in circumstances where a formal referral was not required. The purpose of the post-it note was to give the appellants information as to the name of the person to contact for genetic counselling. No more was required than the provision of that information. As his Honour noted, at [144], the breach was in failing to explain adequately the reason for the referral.
	


Causation

Trial judge’s reasons


	
	Having found that the respondent owed a relevant duty of care to the appellants which was breached, the question becomes whether the harm suffered was caused by the respondent’s breach.
	
	
	In dealing with causation, his Honour stated, at [156], that two hypothetical questions arose, namely, whether, in fact:
	


“(a)   [the appellants], when followed up, would have sought and obtained proper advice as to the hereditary aspects of ATD;

(b)   as a result of advice thus received they would have refrained from having a child using the [second appellant’s] sperm.”


	
	His Honour found, at [157], that had the appellants consulted Ms Duggan she would have referred them to a genetic specialist, such as Dr Mowat, with whom Ms Duggan worked. His Honour noted that there was no issue that had the appellants consulted a genetic specialist, they would have received appropriate advice. His Honour identified the question for determination in those circumstances as being whether the appellants would have sought advice.
	
	
	This question arose in the context that, first, the second appellant had obtained advice from Dr Ramakrishna in 1999 and, secondly, that the second appellant’s evidence was that had the respondent asked whether he had seen Ms Duggan, he would have told the respondent that he had seen Dr Ramakrishna about his ATD and would have told the respondent his understanding of the advice he had received: judgment at [158]-[159].
	
	
	The trial judge did not accept the respondent’s evidence, which he recorded at [160], that he would have accepted what the second appellant told him and would not have checked with Dr Ramakrishna as to whether the advice, as relayed to him by the second appellant, was correct. Rather, his Honour found, at [168], that the respondent would have ascertained when Dr Ramakrishna had given the advice and then telephoned him. His Honour considered that it was probable that this would have revealed the second appellant’s misunderstanding and that the respondent would have informed the appellants of this.
	
	
	His Honour, at [172], was also of the view that the respondent would have given a more detailed explanation to the appellants on follow up. His Honour found that, in particular, the respondent would have:
	


“… pointed out to [the appellants] the fact that there was the possibility of change in the last 12 months, there was the added factor of known infertility which was absent when Dr Ramakrishna advised, the significant likelihood of IVF and the possibility of PGD [Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis] becoming available for ATD.”


	
	His Honour held, at [174], that with the benefit of further explanation by the respondent, the appellants would have attended a consultation with Ms Duggan and with a geneticist, had Ms Duggan advised that such a consultation was required. His Honour, concluded, at [215], that, properly informed, the appellants would have elected not to proceed with IVF at that time, and so would not have had Keeden. These findings were subject to challenge by the respondent in grounds 2 and 3 of the notice of contention which I have already rejected.
	
	
	His Honour, at [216] ff, under a heading “Factual Causation”, dealt with the question whether the harm of which the appellants complained was caused or materially contributed to by the acts or omissions of the respondent. This was to be determined in accordance with the common law principles. As his Honour stated, at [217]:
	


“The relevant question is whether [the respondent’s] breach was so connected with [the appellants’] loss that ‘as a matter of ordinary commonsense and experience it should be regarded as a cause of it’ – [March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506] at 522.”


	
	At trial, the appellants’ case on causation was advanced on two alternative bases. The first basis was that Keeden’s ATD played a causative role in bringing about his disabilities. After reviewing the opinions of the expert witnesses called by both the appellants and the respondent, his Honour, at [238], dismissed this as a cause of Keeden’s CSVT. As I have already indicated, this finding was not challenged on the appeal.
	
	
	The second and alternative basis upon which the appellants submitted that causation was established was that, had they been properly advised, they would have deferred undergoing IVF treatment when they did in October -November 1999 until procedures were available to ensure that only an embryo not affected by the AT3 mutation was transferred to the first appellant. In other words, they would not have proceeded with the IVF treatment using the second appellant’s sperm at that time and Keeden would not have been born. The appellants claimed that as a result of Keeden’s birth, they have suffered “injury, loss and harm to date and continuing”.
	
	
	The trial judge rejected the contention that the loss suffered was caused by the respondent’s breach of duty. His Honour held at [258] that although Keeden had inherited ATD this had not caused the appellants any loss. His Honour concluded, at [260], that the appellants had not established that the loss they claimed was connected with the respondent’s wrong such that, for the purpose of the test enunciated in March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd, it should be regarded as a cause of it.
	
	
	His Honour’s reasoning that led him to this conclusion is to be found at [249]-[260] and, in particular, in his summary, at [259], of the respondent’s contentions, which he accepted, at [260], as to why causation was not made out. Those contentions were:
	


“(a)   the harm alleged by [the appellants] was a consequence of the CSVT. The CSVT was unrelated to the ATD. It was one of the risks of life. It was no more relevant to [the respondent’s] acts or omissions than if Keeden had suffered profound injuries in a car accident;

(b)   the CSVT was totally unrelated to the acts and omissions of [the respondent]. It would have occurred in any event. It would be unreasonable and contrary to principle to impose liability on [the respondent] for harm which resulted from an unrelated condition;

(c)   no harm was occasioned to [the appellants] by reason of Keeden’s ATD;

(d)   the liability was sought to be imposed solely in consequence of Keeden’s existence;

(e)   the existence of Keeden was not causative of [the appellants’] loss in a legal sense, it being merely the factor which secured the presence of Keeden when he sustained CSVT [citing March v E & MH Stramare at 516; Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1996] UKHL 10; [1997] AC 191 at 213; and Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 at [66]];

(f)   the loss claimed was totally disproportionate to the degree of fault for any foreseeable consequences of ATD;

(g)   [the appellants] wanted a child. They had a child albeit with ATD. The ATD has been and remains asymptomatic. The measure of the loss to [the appellants] by reason of Keeden having ATD is nil. To render [the respondent] liable for the financial burden of having, raising and caring for a child disabled by CSVT, perhaps for the whole of his life, is totally disproportionate to the degree of fault and far exceeds any damage which was likely to flow from any act or omission of the defendant in relation to referring [the appellants] for information about ATD.”

Submissions


	
	The appellants submitted that, the policy derived from personal injury cases described in Wallace v Kam (see above at [92]-[ 93]), did not apply here. Rather, in this case, the relevant policy of the law was to protect the appellants’ right to plan their family in terms of choosing if, whether and when they would undertake the moral and legal responsibility to rear and maintain a child. More specifically, the appellants claimed that they were denied the right to choose not to have a child when there was a risk that the child would be inflicted with the same stress and suffering that the second appellant had suffered as a result of his ATD, and it was that right to choose that the policy of the law sought to protect. The appellants sought to sustain this analysis by reference to Cattanach v Melchior and in particular by reference to McHugh and Gummow JJ’s characterisation of the harm in that case at [68], as being “the burden of the legal and moral responsibilities which arise by reason of the birth of the child”.
	
	
	In her evidence, the first appellant acknowledged that the appellants were willing to accept the general risks of pregnancy (see at [44] above). This was also evidenced by their execution of a Request for Treatment form that placed the risk of a baby being born with abnormalities at 4-5 per cent in the case of a pregnancy brought about by IVF treatment. However, they submitted that they were not prepared to accept any risk at all if there was a risk of ATD and so they would not have had a child had they known that there was such a risk.
	
	
	The appellants submitted that Wallace v Kam was also distinguishable as that case involved a failure to warn about risks of temporary and permanent paralysis that were entirely distinct. They submitted that it would be incorrect to characterise the circumstances here as involving distinct risks of ATD and CSVT, the first which they were not willing to assume but the latter which they were. Here:
	


“… the very risk of ATD meant that not only were they not interested in undertaking the equivalent of surgery, they were not interested at that point in time of taking any of the risks of having a baby.”


	
	The appellants submitted that because the risk of having a child with ATD came home, the respondent should be liable for all the consequences that flow from Keeden’s birth. As a secondary position, they submitted that, “at the very least”, they were entitled to the cost of rearing and maintaining Keeden without regard to the extra cost arising from the disabilities caused by his CSVT. However, their primary submission was that the respondent should be liable for the financial and other consequences of Keeden’s CSVT, it being a general risk of any birth.
	
	
	In oral submissions, counsel for the appellants likened the situation with what was referred to as a “no transaction” case: see Kenny & Good Pty Ltd v MGICA. In that case, a real estate valuer negligently valued a property at $5.35 million to $5.5 million, and on the basis of that valuation, a mortgage insurer agreed to indemnify the lender. The true value of the property at the time of valuation was $3.9 million to $4 million. The borrower defaulted, and as a result of a fall in the market, the property only sold for $2.65 million. The insurer indemnified the lender in full for the money outstanding on the loan.
	
	
	The valuer contended that they were not liable for the losses caused by the supervening event of a fall in the market value of the property. The High Court upheld the decision of Lindgren J in the Federal Court to allow the insurer to recover from the valuer the full amount paid out under the insurance policy, rather than limiting the liability of the valuer to the difference between the valuation amount and the actual value of the property.
	
	
	The appellants sought to draw from this case the principle that, if no transaction would have been entered into had the duty of the valuer not been breached, the valuer was causally liable for all consequences of entry into that transaction. The appellants submitted:
	


“[I]f your Honours accept the findings of his Honour that these parents did not want to proceed to have any child at this particular time unless they could be assured [that the risk of ATD was sufficiently low] … then it is akin in every way to a no transaction case… particularly given the fact of the ATD risk having come home.”


	
	The respondent contended that on the trial judge’s findings, this was a case of an omission, namely, the respondent’s failure to raise with the appellants the issue of the potential inheritability of ATD, to explain to the appellants the purpose of the referral to the genetic counsellor, and to follow up to ascertain whether the appellants had consulted Ms Duggan. The respondent submitted that to establish proof of the causal link between an omission and an occurrence requires consideration of the probable course of events had the omission not occurred: Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; 246 CLR 182 at [32] per French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the appellants had failed to establish that the respondent’s breach of duty was so connected with the harm sustained that causation had been established: see March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd. He contended that the harm suffered by the appellants was caused by the consequences of Keeden having suffered a CSVT which was not related to the duty of care he owed to the appellants. He also submitted that Cattanach v Melchior did not assist the appellant as causation was not in issue in that case.
	
	
	The respondent also submitted that at its highest, this was a case where he ought to have warned or provided information in clearer terms about one particular risk, that is, of ATD. Whilst that harm came home, it caused no harm to Keeden or the appellants. Any child was at risk of suffering a CVST and the appellants were willing to accept the usual risks of having a child. The respondent further submitted that this Court’s decision in Paul v Cooke [2013] NSWCA 311; 85 NSWLR 167 was a material analogy where an unavoidable risk came home.
	


Legal principles


	
	The judgment of Mason CJ in March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd is often characterised as establishing, for the purposes of the Australian common law, the test of common sense causation. This characterisation, however, reflects a misunderstanding of the deeply analytical approach his Honour took to the question of causation. His Honour’s legal analysis of causation principles was undertaken as part of his rejection of the “but for” test of causation as the exclusive test for causation in negligence cases.
	
	
	Mason CJ observed, at 514, that “legal questions of causation are asked and answered with a view to allocating legal responsibility”. Within that framework, the “but for” test was, in his Honour’s view, important as a negative criterion of causation. Nonetheless, as his Honour noted, at 514, it remains for the plaintiff to prove that his or her injuries were “caused or materially contributed to” by the defendant’s wrongful conduct.
	
	
	Mason CJ’s approach was in contrast to the approach of McHugh J in that case, whereby McHugh J considered that once the “but for” test was satisfied, existence of a duty of care and breach of duty having been established, the question whether a defendant was liable to a plaintiff depended on questions of remoteness of damage: see at 534. McHugh J noted, at 530, that the conclusion that the defendant’s negligence was not a cause of the damage, even if the “but for” test was satisfied: 
	


“… has to be based upon a rule that enables the tribunal of fact to make a value judgment that in the circumstances [of the harm suffered] legal responsibility did not attach to the defendant even though his or her act or omission was a necessary precondition of the occurrence of the damage.”


	
	McHugh J continued:
	


“Whatever label is given to such a rule – ‘common sense principles’, ‘foreseeabilty’ … and so on - the reality is that such a limiting rule is the product of a policy choice that legal liability is not to attach to an act or omission which is outside the scope of that rule even though the act or omission was a necessary precondition of the occurrence of damage to the plaintiff. That is to say, such a rule is concerned only with the question whether a person should be held responsible for an act or omission which ex hypothesi was necessarily one of the sum of conditions or relations which produced the damage.”


	
	In Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55; 195 CLR 232, McHugh J explained the role of the ‘but for’ test in the following terms:
	


“26.   Underlying the rejection of the ‘but for’ test as the determinant of legal causation is the instinctive belief that a person should not be liable for every wrongful act or omission which is a necessary condition of the occurrence of the injury that befell the plaintiff. As Mason CJ emphasised in [March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd], causation for legal purposes is concerned with allocating responsibility for harm or damage that has occurred. So the mere fact that injury would not have occurred but for the defendant's act or omission is often not enough to establish a causal connection for legal purposes …

…

28.   In principle, therefore, if the act or omission of the defendant has done no more than expose the plaintiff to a class of risk to which the plaintiff would have been exposed irrespective of the defendant's act or omission, the law of torts should not require the defendant to pay damages … No principle of the law of … tort or of risk allocation requires the defendant to be liable for those risks of an activity or course of conduct that cannot be avoided or reduced by the exercise of reasonable care unless statute, contract or a duty otherwise imposed by law has made the defendant responsible for those risks.” (citations omitted)


	
	In Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 240 CLR 537, at [111], Kiefel J outlined the essential requirement for legal causation:
	


“The common law requires proof, by the person seeking compensation, that the negligent act or omission caused the loss or injury constituting the damage. All that is necessary is that, according to the course of common experience, the more probable inference appearing from the evidence is that a defendant's negligence caused the injury or harm. ‘More probable’ means no more than that, upon a balance of probabilities, such an inference might reasonably be considered to have some greater degree of likelihood; it does not require certainty.”


	
	Her Honour at [112], in a discussion of the role of the ‘but for’ test in the determination of causation at common law, adverted to the value and policy considerations that are involved, as follows:
	


“The ‘but for’ test is regarded as having an important role in the resolution of the issue of causation, although more as a negative criterion than as a comprehensive test. The resolution of the question of causation has been to involve the common sense idea of one matter being the cause of another. But it is also necessary to understand the purpose for making an inquiry about causation and that may require value judgments and policy choices.” (citations omitted)


	
	In Wallace v Kam, at [23], the Court similarly noted the role of legal policy in the determination of causation:
	


“In a novel case [it is] incumbent on a court answering the normative question [as to causation] explicitly to consider and to explain in terms of legal policy whether or not, and if so why, responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. What is required in such a case is the identification and articulation of an evaluative judgment by reference to ‘the purposes and policy of the relevant part of the law’.”


	
	Although in Wallace v Kam causation was governed by the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), s 5D, the evaluative considerations involved at common law do not differ in substance. As the Court remarked, at [24]:
	


“A limiting principle of the common law is that the scope of liability in negligence normally does not extend beyond liability for the occurrence of such harm the risk of which it was the duty of the negligent party to exercise reasonable care and skill to avoid.”


	
	I have referred above to the observations of Mason CJ that causation was directed to allocating legal responsibility. In Chappel v Hart, Gummow J at [63] ff, turned his attention to the rule of attribution of responsibility. This had been the subject of consideration by Lord Hoffmann in Environment Agency (formerly National Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd [1999] AC 22. As explained by Gummow J:
	


“63.   [Lord Hoffman] went on to emphasise that (a) the legal issue is not what caused the result complained of, but did the defendant cause it, and (b) ‘common sense’ answers to questions of causation will differ according to the purpose for which the question is asked and the rule by which responsibility is being attributed. In particular, ‘one cannot give a common sense answer to a question of causation for the purpose of attributing responsibility under some rule without knowing the purpose and scope of the rule’.

64.   … His Lordship concluded:

‘Before answering questions about causation, it is therefore first necessary to identify the scope of the relevant rule. This is not a question of common sense fact; it is a question of law …’”


	
	Environment Agency v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd was not the first occasion in which Lord Hoffman had dealt with the relevant rule of responsibility as identifying the circumstances in which harm suffered will be found to be caused by the defendant’s breach of duty. In Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star, his Lordship observed at 213:
	


“Rules that make the wrongdoer liable for all the consequences of his wrongful conduct are exceptional and need to be justified by some special policy. Normally the law limits liability to those consequences which are attributable to that which made the act wrongful …”


	
	His Lordship then provided the well-known example of the mountaineer with the bad knee:
	


“A mountaineer about to undertake a difficult climb is concerned about the fitness of his knee. He goes to a doctor who negligently makes a superficial examination and pronounces the knee fit. The climber goes on the expedition, which he would not have undertaken if the doctor had told him the true state of his knee. He suffers an injury which is an entirely foreseeable consequence of mountaineering but has nothing to do with his knee.”


	
	His Lordship, in rejecting the approach of the Court of Appeal, considered that on the usual principles of causation, the doctor would not have been liable: “the injury has not been caused by the doctor’s bad advice because it would have occurred even if the advice had been correct”.  His Lordship explained why this was so at 214:
	


“The Court of Appeal’s principle [that the doctor would be liable] offends common sense because it makes the doctor responsible for consequences which, though in general terms foreseeable, do not appear to have a sufficient causal connection with the subject matter of the duty. The doctor was asked for information on only one of the considerations which might affect the safety of the mountaineer on the expectation. There seems no reason of policy which requires that the negligence of the doctor should require the transfer to him of all the foreseeable risks of the expedition.

I think that one can to some extent generalise the principle upon which this response depends. It is that a person under a duty to take reasonable care to provide information on which someone else will decide upon a course of action is, if negligent, not generally regarded as responsible for all consequences of that course of action. He is responsible only for the consequences of the information being wrong. A duty of care which imposes upon the informant responsibility for losses which would have occurred even if the information which he gave had been correct is not in my view fair and reasonable as between the parties. It is therefore inappropriate either as an implied term of a contract or as a tortious duty arising from the relationship between them.”


	
	Relevantly to the circumstances of this case, his Lordship, at 214, drew a distinction between a duty to provide information so as to enable a person to decide upon a course of action, and a duty to advise as to what course of action to take:
	


“If the duty is to advise whether or not a course of action should be taken, the adviser must take reasonable care to consider all the potential consequences of that course of action. If he is negligent, he will therefore be responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of that course of action having been taken. If his duty is only to supply information, he must take reasonable care to ensure that the information is correct and, if he is negligent, will be responsible for all the foreseeable consequences of the information being wrong.”


	
	The relevant “rule of responsibility” of the alleged tortfeasor in the determination of causation has been widely endorsed in Australian law: see for example Rosenberg v Percival at [85] per Gummow J; Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre v Anzil at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreeing; Wallace v Kam at [37] (where the plurality cited the above passage from Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance) and Paul v Cooke at [90] ff per Leeming JA. Directing attention to the “rule of responsibility” highlights the connection between the duty of care of the negligent party and the scope of liability in negligence.
	
	
	In Chappel v Hart Gummow J discussed the policy rationale for the determination of causation in medical negligence cases, as follows:
	


“65.   The nature and purpose of a duty with the content established in Rogers v Whitaker concern the right of the patient to know of material risks which are involved in undergoing or forgoing certain treatment. This, in turn, arises from the patient's right to decide for himself or herself whether or not to submit to the treatment in question. That choice ‘is, in reality, meaningless unless it is made on the basis of relevant information and advice’.

66.   … It is true that in some cases of a failure to warn by a medical practitioner an application of the ‘but for’ test without qualification could lead to absurd or unjust results. Such would have been the situation if, for example, instead of suffering damage to her laryngeal nerve, Mrs Hart had been injured through the misapplication of anaesthetic. Whilst it would still be open to conclude that, but for Dr Chappel’s failure to warn her of the possibility of damage to her voice, she would not have opted for the operation at that time and would not have been injured by the anaesthetic, the law would not conclude that the failure to warn of the risk of injury to the laryngeal nerve caused the injury resulting from the anaesthetic.”


	
	Hayne J made a similar point as follows:
	


“[118]   The importance of examining the nature of the connection between the negligent conduct and the damage can be demonstrated in this way. If the respondent had not been operated on when she was, but had had her operation on another day, the chances are that she would not have suffered the damage to her laryngeal nerve that she did. There may have been no perforation of the oesophagus, there may have been no infection, there may have been no damage to the nerve. The whole tenor of the evidence given at the trial was that if it was the infection that led to paralysis of the laryngeal nerve (and this was the explanation favoured by Professor Benjamin in his written report) infection was such a rare event that it was unlikely (indeed very unlikely) that it would have happened if the operation had been performed on another day. Of course, the respondent did suffer a perforated oesophagus, she did suffer an infection, she did suffer paralysis of the laryngeal nerve. But if she had not attended the hospital on that day, the probabilities are that none of this would have happened. And if the appellant had told her of the risk to her voice, she would not have had the operation when she did. But precisely the same argument would be open if, instead of suffering damage to her voice, as she has, the operating theatre in which her procedure was performed had been struck by lightning, or a runaway truck, and she had been injured. But for the negligent failure to warn she would not have been in harm's way.

[119]   No doubt the case of the lightning strike or the runaway truck invite consideration of novus actus interveniens and whether, although ‘the earlier wrongful act or omission may have amounted to an essential condition of the occurrence of the ultimate harm, it was not the true cause or a true cause of that harm’. But that is no more than a particular example of the general proposition that the tort of negligence requires a particular kind of causal relationship between the negligent act or omission of the defendant and the damage suffered by the plaintiff.” (citation omitted)


	
	The relevant “rule of responsibility” in a medical negligence case was again considered in Wallace v Kam. The Court, having referred to the duty of a medical practitioner at [36] and the policy underlying that duty, said, at [37]:
	


“The appropriate rule of attribution, or ‘rule of responsibility’ … is therefore one that ‘seeks to hold the doctor liable for the consequence of material risks that were not warned of [and] that were unacceptable to the patient’. The normative judgment that is appropriate to be made is that the liability of a medical practitioner who has failed to warn the patient of material risks inherent in a proposed treatment ‘should not extend to harm from risks that the patient was willing to hazard …’”

Consideration


	
	Having regard to the findings made by the trial judge, which have not been disturbed on this appeal, ‘but for’ causation has been established. However, as the authorities discussed above establish, that is not sufficient proof of legal causation in a case such as the present. The wrongful act in this case, assuming that the harm was within the scope of duty that the respondent owed to the appellants, was a failure to give an adequate explanation for the referral to the genetic counsellor and, arguably, a failure to follow up as to whether the counselling had been undertaken. In determining whether such failure caused loss, it is necessary to identify the policy underlying the respondent’s duty to cause the appellants to be informed of the inheritability of ATD.
	
	
	The appellants consulted the respondent in order to facilitate pregnancy. Their desire for a pregnancy was qualified, in that they did not seek to have a child in all circumstances, and particularly sought to avoid the risk of having a child with ATD. However, they were not seeking to avoid the general risks of childbirth, or the “legal and moral responsibilities” that arise as a result of the birth of a child. On that basis, the relationship between the appellants and the respondent is distinguishable from the doctor and patients in Cattanach v Melchior, where the specific purpose of the medical consultations and sterilisation procedure undertaken by Mrs Melchior was to avoid pregnancy. It also needs to be reiterated that causation was not in issue in Cattanach v Melchior. The High Court was there only concerned with the question of whether the costs of rearing a child were a recoverable form of damages.
	
	
	As this case cannot be decided by direct analogy with Cattanach v Melchoir, it falls within the general principles of causation discussed above. In particular, as found in Wallace v Kam, the underlying policy consideration giving rise to the relevant rule of attribution of legal liability is the duty to protect patients from the occurrence of physical injury, the risk of which is unacceptable to the patient. In this case, the unacceptable risk that the appellants were not willing to bear was having a child with the inherited condition of ATD. That risk came home, but no loss was shown to have been caused by the ATD. However, as Kiefel J observed in Roads and Traffic Authority v Royal [2008] HCA 19; 82 ALJR 870, to make the respondent liable for expenses that flowed from something that would have occurred in any event, would be to impose a liability on the respondent that was, in effect, one of strict liability.
	
	
	The matter can be tested by positing the circumstance that the appellants were involved in a blameless accident on the way home from hospital with the same catastrophic consequences as occurred here, or that Keeden contracted some other disease such as rheumatic fever or polio, or had an aneurism unrelated to ATD. Some such event could occur almost immediately after birth or it may not occur until some later point in time. It would not be appropriate for the respondent’s liability to extend to all the harm suffered by the parents as a consequence of Keeden’s birth, in circumstances where the appellants were willing to hazard the general risks of a pregnancy induced by IVF treatment. Such general risks included the miniscule risk of CSVT, which in fact materialised. This is the result notwithstanding that the appellants would not have undergone IVF treatment had they been informed of the risk of ATD. The CSVT was coincidental, for legal purposes, to the inheritance of ATD.
	
	
	Expressing the risk that came home as being the occurrence of ATD also exposes that the risk of ATD was a distinct risk to that of CSVT. The appellants’ contention that the general risks of pregnancy, including CSVT, and the risk of a child having ATD, should be accumulated in the manner described in Moyes v Lothian Health Board 1990 SCT 444; [1990] 1 Med LR 463 at 447, does not assist them to prove that the harm they suffered was causally connected to the negligence. In that case, it was held that, if a doctor warned a patient of one risk but failed to warn of four others, and the one risk warned of subsequently came home, the doctor could be held liable on the basis that the patient was prevented from making an informed decision whether to proceed with an operation on the basis of the aggregate risk of injury created by all five of the risk factors.
	
	
	This finding involved an aggregation of a number of comparable outcomes with different causes into a unified overall risk of injury. It was made on the basis that the ordinary person “is not interested in the exact pathological genesis of the various complications which can occur but rather in the nature and extent of the risk”: at 447. It is a different matter to aggregate the risks here, namely, of a child being born with ATD and of a catastrophic neonatal event, which are different in kind from each other and occurred at different times. It cannot be said that there was, in this case, a single risk of harm with different pathological geneses. Rather, there were two entirely distinct risks.
	
	
	In my opinion, the appellants do not gain any assistance from Kenny & Good Pty Ltd v MGICA: see above at [161]-[163]. The decision in Kenny & Good hinged closely on the words of the negligent valuation. McHugh J, at [60], noted that the valuation report not only provided a valuation, but was also “warranting” that a particular sum could be safely lent for up to five years. Gummow J, at [80]-[81], held that in the ordinary case the insurer would not have been able to recover the full amount of the loss, but that the case was “not such an ordinary situation”. See similarly Kirby and Callinan JJ at [95]. The circumstances in this case are different from those with which the court was concerned in Kenny & Good. 
	
	
	However, there is another consideration to which regard must be had. Whilst the appellants’ principal claim was for the costs of raising Keeden having regard to his disabilities caused by the CSVT, as well as the physical and psychological conditions from which they suffer as a result of caring for him, they argued alternatively that they were entitled to the costs of raising him without reference to his disabilities. This argument turns attention to the principle stated in Strong v Woolworths referred to above at [164], namely, that in determining causation in the case of an omission it is necessary to consider the probable course of events had the omission not occurred.
	
	
	That case was not made at trial and the evidence on it pointed in different directions. On the one hand, the appellants said that they would not have had the child when they did but would have waited until testing techniques were sufficiently advanced to ensure that, in accessing IVF treatment, a foetus with ATD would not have been implanted. As at 1999, it was considered that there was a reasonable chance that such testing would be available in three to five years: see [19] above. On the other hand, the first appellant was at all times prepared to accept the usual risks of child birth. It is possible, therefore, that the appellants may have had a child with some form of abnormality.
	
	
	Even if the appellants were entitled to damages on this alternative contention, such damages would only be for the acceleration of child rearing expenses for a period of a few years. Such damages would be very small and likely to be less than $10,000. However, as I do not understand that claim was made in the Court below, I would not be inclined to remit the matter for the determination of damages flowing from that loss, should they be so entitled. The costs in doing so would exceed any possible outcome.
	
	
	It follows, in my opinion, that the appellants have not been successful in showing a causal link between any loss to them and any breach of a duty owed by the respondent.
	


Was the damage too remote?


	
	If my findings as to causation are incorrect, it remains to consider whether the damage was too remote to be recoverable. The trial judge, although having rejected the appellants’ claim on the basis of causation, also made findings that the harm suffered by the appellants was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the acts and omissions alleged against the respondent and so was too remote for the purposes of recovering compensation for breach of the respondent’s duty of care.
	
	
	Barker, Cane, Lunney and Trindade, in The Law of Torts in Australia 5th ed, Oxford, observe at 558 that remoteness, like causation, is ultimately concerned with allocating responsibility for harm. However, whereas causation focuses on the negligent conduct, remoteness of damage focuses on its consequences.
	
	
	For damage to be reasonably foreseeable, it is enough if a consequence of the same general character as that which followed the negligence was reasonably foreseeable as one likely to follow: Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey [1970] HCA 60; 125 CLR 383 at 390, 393, 402-3, 413-14. Barwick CJ, at 390, noted that a defendant may be liable no matter how rare a particular clinical phenomenon may be if some injury of the same class as the injury suffered is foreseeable: see also Rowe v McCartney [1976] 2 NSWLR 72 at 79.
	
	
	Similarly, in Chapman v Hearse [1961] HCA 46; 106 CLR 112 at 120 it was held that it was unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove that the precise manner of sustaining the injury was foreseeable. See also Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW (1985) 2 NSWLR 501 at 504. This is so unless the particular risk is so small that a defendant would be justified in neglecting it: Jaensch v Coffey [1984] HCA 52; 155 CLR 549 at 562-3.
	
	
	When an accident is of a different kind to that which could have been foreseen, the defendant is not liable: Overseas Tankships (UK) v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd [1961] AC 388 (The Wagon Mound (No 1)). To be foreseeable the risk must have been a real risk, that is, one that would occur to a reasonable person in the defendant’s position and which is not far-fetched. Overseas Tankships (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co [1967] 1 AC 617 (The Wagon Mound (No 2)).
	
	
	Harold Luntz, in Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death 4th ed (2002) Butterworths, observed at 154, that once causation is established, reasonable foreseeability of harm marks the limits of the defendant’s liability: see The Wagon Mound (No 1) at 426; Rowe v McCartney at 84. However, this statement cannot be accepted without qualification. As McHugh J observed in March v Stramare, at 536, foreseeability is not the sole test of remoteness of damage. Rather, there is also a question whether the defendant should be:
	


“… exempted from responsibility on the ground that the plaintiff’s damage was not within the scope of the risk created by the defendants’ breach of duty.”


	
	This statement was made as part of his Honour’s minority view in that case in respect of causation. However, as is apparent from the authorities discussed in this section, it reflects orthodox principles as to remoteness of damage. It also serves to emphasise the importance of ascertaining the scope of the risk in determining whether a defendant will be found liable for breach of a duty of care. Thus, whilst liability is imposed for all the foreseeable consequences of negligence, a defendant will only be liable where the harm suffered “is within the risk created by the negligence”: Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66 at 85; Hughes v the Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837 at 858.
	
	
	The application of those principles was explained by McHugh JA in Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW at 533-4 as follows:
	


“When the plaintiff depends upon proof of some damage to complete his cause of action, his case may fail for one of two reasons. First, the damage suffered may not be of the same kind as that which could be reasonably foreseen as a possible result of the defendant's careless act or omission. Damage by the ignition of furnace oil is not the same as damage by fouling by furnace oil: The Wagon Mound (No 1). Secondly, according to the decision in Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Co Ltd [1964] 1 QB 518, even when the damage is of the same kind as that which was reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's negligence, the action may still fail. It will fail if the manner in which the damage occurred was not reasonably foreseeable in a general way. This is because the damage which occurred is not within the ambit of the risk of harm arising from the defendant's careless act or omission. In Doughty the Court of Appeal held that, if the foreseeable risk of injury from allowing a cover to fall into a cauldron of hot molten liquid was burning by splashing, the defendant was not liable for burning by splashing by an unforeseeable explosion caused by the cover falling into the liquid. Nevertheless, it is only when the damage can be said to be the result of a completely different ‘accident’ that it will be outside the foreseeable risk of harm: Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837. A similar problem arises when the negligence of the defendant produces damage which is foreseeable as part of the risk but produces additional damage which is not itself reasonably foreseeable. If the damage is of the same kind as that of the foreseeable damage, the defendant is generally liable: The Wagon Mound (No 1). However, it may be that even when the damage is of the same kind as the damage for which the defendant is responsible, the defendant will escape liability because the additional damage was caused in a manner which was no part of the risk of harm which resulted in the foreseeable damage. In this class of case it will, I think, often be found that the particular act of negligence which caused the additional and unforeseeable damage is different from the particular act of negligence which caused the foreseeable damage. But this may not always be the case. Some other event may combine with the foreseeable damage to produce further damage.”


	
	The respondent did not argue that the possibility of having a child who carried the genetic ATD condition was not foreseeable. However, the appellants have suffered no harm that has resulted from Keeden’s ATD. Rather, Keeden has suffered catastrophic injuries due to an event after birth, the incidence of which was extremely rare in neonatal babies and in children generally. That event was unrelated to Keeden’s inherited ATD and was unrelated to any information with which the appellants would have been provided had they received genetic counselling. Even if the appellants’ losses flowing from this event are the relevant harm in this case, I agree with the primary judge that that harm was not foreseeable so as to come within the scope of the risk created by the respondent’s negligence.
	
	
	In cases where a plaintiff has suffered injury subsequent to the initial harm sustained as a result of a defendant’s negligence, a question arises as to whether the defendant is liable for that injury. In Mahony v J Kruschich (Demolitions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 37; 156 CLR 522, the Court stated, at 528-529:
	


“A negligent tortfeasor does not always avoid liability for the consequences of a plaintiff's subsequent injury, even if the subsequent injury is tortiously inflicted. It depends on whether or not the subsequent tort and its consequences are themselves properly to be regarded as foreseeable consequences of the first tortfeasor's negligence. A line marking the boundary of the damage for which a tortfeasor is liable in negligence may be drawn either because the relevant injury is not reasonably foreseeable or because the chain of causation is broken by a novus actus interveniens (M'Kew v. Holland & Hannen & Cubitts (1970) SC(HL)20, at p 25). But it must be possible to draw such a line clearly before a liability for damage that would not have occurred but for the wrongful act or omission of a tortfeasor and that is reasonably foreseeable by him is treated as the result of a second tortfeasor's negligence alone: see Chapman v. Hearse [1961] HCA 46; (1961) 106 CLR 112, at pp 124-125. Whether such a line can and should be drawn is very much a matter of fact and degree (ibid., p.122).”


	
	This principle was applied most recently in the High Court in Hunt & Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd.
	
	
	The present case is not one where there was a subsequent tortious act. Nonetheless, this case raises a similar question, namely whether the law should respond to the claim made here, in which the appellants contend that they are entitled to all the life consequences, that is all the consequences of Keeden’s existence, including those caused directly by Keeden’s CSVT that followed the respondent’s negligence.
	
	
	In my opinion, the damage sustained by the appellants was too remote such that the respondent ought not to be liable for it. Except for the risk of having a child with ATD, the appellants were willing to undertake the risks of pregnancy, including the risks that a child they might have may be born with abnormalities. Those risk factors were in the order of at least 2-3 per cent and potentially as high as 4-5 per cent (see [45] above). The cause of Keeden’s CSVT was multifactorial, but was not associated with ATD. The appellants also consented to undertaking the IVF treatment notwithstanding that there were risks that included complications. The risk of a child with ATD also suffering a CSVT was miniscule, as was the risk of a child without ATD suffering a CSVT.
	
	
	Given these factual circumstances, I am of the opinion that the harm suffered by the appellants was not within the scope of the risk created by the respondent’s negligence. The risk of harm that they sought to avoid was the risk that they would have a child with ATD. Although that risk of harm ‘came home’ in that Keeden was born with ATD, that condition was not associated with the occurrence of the CSVT.
	
	
	Nor do I consider that the risk of Keeden suffering a catastrophic event such as occurred here was relevantly foreseeable. It was not damage of the same kind as having a child with ATD, albeit that it was more catastrophic. As I have said, it was a risk that was miniscule and must be considered to be encompassed within the risks that the appellants were prepared to accept.
	


Other issues

Contributory negligence


	
	His Honour noted, at [272], that the issue of contributory negligence had been raised, but declined to consider it as the liability of the respondent had not been established. As I consider the appeal must fail, I have not found it necessary to consider contributory negligence in any detail. However, had the appeal succeeded, I would not have found the appellants to be contributorily negligent. They were in a situation which was significantly alien to them. They had placed themselves in the hands of experts. Had the respondent adequately advised them of the reason for the genetic counselling, on his Honour’s findings, it was probable that they would have sought it out.
	


Damages


	
	Finally, although it was not necessary in light of his earlier findings to determine the quantum of damages, his Honour, at [273] ff, made a number of comments on the approach to the assessment of damages. His Honour noted that it was common ground that Keeden’s disability was such that, as a result of suffering the CSVT, he would require full time care for his lifetime and that he had an agreed life expectancy of 52 years.
	
	
	A number of aspects of his Honour’s findings on damages were challenged. However, as I have found that the appellants have not established that they are entitled to recover damages for the harm suffered, it is not necessary to give further consideration to this issue.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Appeal dismissed;

2.   The appellants to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.


	
	McCOLL JA: The facts and submissions are fully set out in Beazley P’s judgment which I have had the advantage of reading in draft. I agree generally with her Honour’s reasons and with the orders she proposes. I would add the following observations. I repeat the facts only to the extent necessary to inform the context.
	
	
	The appellants, Deborah and Lawrence Waller, wished to have a child. After receiving invitro fertilisation (“IVF”) treatment co-ordinated by the respondent, Dr Christopher James, Mrs Waller bore a child, Keeden. The IVF treatment used the second appellant’s sperm and the first appellant’s ovum. The second appellant had been diagnosed as a teenager as having a condition known as anti thrombin deficiency (“ATD”) (also known as Factor III Deficiency or AT3). ATD is a condition which leads to blood clotting.
	
	
	Keeden inherited ATD from his father. Four or five days after his birth, Keeden suffered an extensive cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (“CSVT”), or stroke, as a result of which he is, and will remain, profoundly disabled. The CSVT was unrelated to the ATD.
	
	
	ATD is a non-gender related condition capable of inheritance with only one copy of the defective gene, hence from one parent. Prior to Keeden’s birth, the appellants erroneously understood that it was only if they both carried the ATD gene that there was a possibility that condition could be transmitted to their child.
	
	
	The appellants were unsuccessful in proceedings they brought against the respondent in which they alleged he had breached the duty of care he owed them as a medical practitioner in failing to inform, or cause them to be informed, of the hereditary aspects of ATD. They alleged at trial that, had they been properly informed, they would not have proceeded to conceive a child using the second appellant’s sperm and thus would have avoided the harm which has befallen them. [1] 
	
	
	The proceedings pre-dated the Health Care Liability Act 2001 (NSW) and the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (“CLA”) and, accordingly, fell to be determined in accordance with the common law. [2] 
	
	
	The primary judge found:
	



	
	Subject to considerations of reasonable foreseeability, remoteness and causation, the respondent owed a duty of care to the appellants to ascertain if they were aware that ATD was potentially inheritable, to explain to them the purpose of the proposed referral (to a genetic counsellor, Ms Duggan), to properly refer them to an appropriate person for the obtaining of that information subject to their approval, to ascertain if such consultation had taken place, and if not why not, and to reinforce the reasons why it would be desirable to consult with the genetic consultant or geneticist. [3] 
	
	
	The respondent breached his duty of care to the appellants because he did not raise with them the potential inheritability of ATD and because nor did he adequately explain to them the purpose of the referral to a genetic counsellor, with the consequence that the appellants did not seek to contact Ms Duggan after the failure of the first attempt. [4] 
	
	
	If they had been properly advised, the appellants would have attended the proposed consultation with Ms Duggan and with a geneticist if required. [5] 
	
	
	If properly informed, the appellants would have elected not to have Keeden. [6] 
	
	
	The appellants failed to establish that the ATD caused or materially contributed to the CSVT. [7] 
	
	
	The CSVT was unrelated to ATD. [8] 
	
	
	The appellants did not establish that their loss was so connected with the respondent’s fault that “as a matter of ordinary common sense and experience it should be regarded as a cause of it”. [9] 
	
	
	The physical damage and economic loss associated with having, raising and caring for Keeden, for which the appellants claimed, were not within the scope of the duty as such damage was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the acts and omissions alleged against the respondent. Rather, his liability concerned a failure to cause information to be obtained in relation to ATD. [10] 
	
	
	The damage was too remote. Although it was foreseeable that Keeden might inherit ATD and it may become symptomatic at some stage during his lifetime, the harm for which recovery was sought, namely the consequences of CSVT, was not reasonably foreseeable, there being, in effect, a miniscule number of such cases recorded generally and particularly of the sort Keeden suffered. [11] 
	



	
	The appellants do not challenge the finding set out in [221](5) and (6).
	
	
	In addition, it should be noted, as Beazley P has explained, that prior to undergoing the IVF treatment, the appellants signed documents warning of the risks both of that treatment and of an abnormal baby being born. The first appellant accepted she was aware of those risks. [12]  The appellants do not challenge the proposition that CSVT fell within the ambit of such risks.
	
	
	As Beazley P has also explained, the appellants have shifted the focus of their argument in this Court concerning the harm they allege they suffered as a result of the respondent’s breach of duty from “economic loss associated with having, raising and caring for Keeden, and physical injury, including psychological damage”, to damage to their “right … to plan their family”. [13] 
	
	
	The common law of negligence requires determination of causation for the purpose of attributing legal responsibility. Such a determination inevitably involves two questions: a question of historical fact as to how particular harm occurred; and a normative question as to whether legal responsibility for that particular harm occurring in that way should be attributed to a particular person. [14]  In determining the normative question, considerations of policy have a prominent part to play, as do accepted value judgments. [15] 
	
	
	The appellants established factual causation. That is to say that, properly informed, they would have elected not to have Keeden. [16]  However, the “harm” they suffered is not that against which they should have been warned (and which would have led to them not proceeding with IVF): that being the inheritability of ATD. Rather, the harm they suffered, in the literal sense, was bearing a child who was disabled catastrophically by an extremely rare medical event: CVST, being a risk of birth they had agreed to accept.
	
	
	The appellants were, accordingly, in a similar position to the plaintiff in Wallace in that they sought to render the respondent liable for an injury they were prepared to accept, but would have avoided had they been properly warned about a different, and unrelated or distinct, risk. [17]  The harm for which they seek to recover is not the harm consequent upon not being warned about the risk of ATD, save in the most general sense of bearing Keeden. Rather, the harm for which they seek to recover is damages arising from the pain and suffering they have suffered through bearing a child who suffered catastrophic injuries after his birth by reason of a risk of abnormality inherent in bearing children of which they were warned and were prepared to accept.
	
	
	The question which must be determined is whether, in those circumstances, legal responsibility for Keeden’s CSVT should be attributed to the respondent. That evaluation is made by a functional evaluation of the relationship and the purposes and policy of the relevant part of the law. [18] 
	
	
	A limiting principle of the common law is that the scope of liability in negligence normally does not extend beyond liability for the occurrence of such harm the risk of which it was the duty of the negligent party to exercise reasonable care and skill to avoid. [19]  Such a rule that, in the circumstances, legal responsibility did not attach to the defendant even though his or her act or omission was a necessary precondition of the occurrence of the damage, is the product of a policy choice that legal liability is not to attach to an act or omission which is outside the scope of that rule even though the act or omission was a necessary precondition of the occurrence of damage to the plaintiff. [20] 
	
	
	Thus, as explained in Wallace (footnotes omitted): [21] 
	


“…liability for breach of a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill to avoid foreseeable harm does not extend beyond harm that was foreseeable at the time of breach. In a similar way, ‘a person under a duty to take reasonable care to provide information on which someone else will decide upon a course of action is, if negligent, not generally regarded as responsible for all the consequences of that course of action’ but ‘only for the consequences of the information being wrong’.”


	
	The respondent’s duty to warn the appellants of the risk of the inheritability of ATD was “imposed by reference to the underlying common law right of the patient to choose whether or not to undergo a proposed treatment”. [22]  However, the policy which underpinned that duty was to “to protect the patient from the occurrence of physical injury the risk of which is unacceptable to the patient [and it] is appropriate that the scope of liability for breach of the duty reflect that underlying policy”. [23] 
	
	
	Accordingly, the respondent’s liability “‘should not extend to harm from risks that the patient was willing to hazard, whether through an express choice or as found had their disclosure been made’.” [24]  The CSVT was a distinct risk the appellants were willing to accept. The respondent should not bear legal responsibility for it.
	
	
	The appellants cannot escape this conclusion by pitching their case at the high level of generality that the relevant harm is damage to their right to plan their family. In the final analysis, even accepting that characterisation, the normative question of causation had to be determined. It was properly determined adversely to the appellants by the primary judge.
	
	
	WARD JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Beazley P. I agree with her Honour that the appeal should be dismissed with costs, broadly for the reasons her Honour has given.
	
	
	I have had some difficulty with the conclusion reached by the primary judge that the respondent’s duty of care in this case extended beyond the provision of sufficient information relating to genetic counselling to enable the appellants to make an informed decision as to whether to seek such counselling (i.e., the conclusion by the primary judge that the respondent’s duty extended to ascertaining whether, and if not why not, such a consultation had taken place – see [91]).
	
	
	As Beazley P has noted, the respondent did not have the primary duty to advise the appellants on issues of heredity. Provided he had adequately explained to the appellants the purpose of genetic counselling, so that they could determine the importance to them of seeking that counselling in order to make an informed decision as to the planning of their family, it was a matter for them whether or not they chose to pursue that course and I am not persuaded that the respondent had an obligation to follow that up or to ensure that they had received any such counselling.
	
	
	I accept that the evidence of Dr O’Loughlin and Professor Saunders supported a finding that the content of the duty of care extended to a duty to ensure that the appellants were adequately informed as to the hereditary aspect of ATD and that for that purpose the appellants ought be referred to a genetic counsellor. However, those experts themselves recognised that not every patient ought to be referred for genetic counselling.
	
	
	Nevertheless, nothing turns in my opinion on whether the duty did extend as far as the primary judge accepted. The appellants’ lack of appreciation of the importance to them, bearing in mind their concern not to have a child with the inherited ATD gene, of pursuing the referral to Ms Duggan indicates that, even if the content of the duty of care in the present case did not extend to a duty to follow up the referral, the respondent had failed to provide the appellants with sufficient information for them to be aware of the importance of such counselling.
	
	
	In any event, for the reasons given by Beazley P, I am of the view that the primary judge correctly concluded that the harm suffered by the appellants was not within the scope of the overall duty owed by the respondent and therefore that legal causation is not made out. I also agree that, even if a contrary conclusion were reached on the question of causation, the harm that was suffered was one that was not reasonably foreseeable. True it is, that it was reasonably foreseeable that if the appellants proceeded with the IVF procedure using Mr Waller’s sperm, a child resulting from that procedure might inherit the ATD gene. What was not reasonably foreseeable was that the making of an uninformed decision to proceed with the IVF procedure at that time (using Mr Waller’s sperm) could result in a pregnancy with the catastrophic outcome that this one did.
	
	
	I add the following observations.
	
	
	The appellants’ case on the appeal, as Beazley P has noted, identified the harm suffered as a deprivation of their right to plan their family in terms of choosing whether and when they would undertake the moral and legal responsibility of rearing and maintaining a child.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, the appellants placed much store on the recognition by the High Court in Cattanach v Melchior [2003] HCA 38; 215 CLR 1 at [61] of the right to plan a family. Significantly, however, this was not a failed sterilisation case (as it was in Cattanach). Here, the infringement of the right to plan their family was that they were provided with insufficient information as to the hereditary aspects of ATD and therefore made a decision to undergo the IVF procedure using Mr Waller’s sperm without a full understanding of the potential for their child to inherit the ATD gene.
	
	
	The appellants very much wanted a child. They were prepared to accept the ordinary risks of childbirth; indeed the IVF consent form acknowledged as much. What they were not prepared to accept was the 50% risk of a child of theirs inheriting the ATD gene. This was not a case where they had determined not to have children and the foreseeable consequence of a failed sterilisation procedure was that they would have a child and thus be forced to assume moral and legal responsibilities that they had chosen not to assume. Rather, the question was one as to the timing of the IVF procedure they were considering undertaking (a procedure which in any event was not guaranteed to produce a child) and, perhaps, a related question as to whether they chose to undergo the procedure using Mr Waller’s sperm or donated sperm.
	
	
	This was, in a similar way to the situation in Paul v Cooke [2013] NSWCA 311, a case where the respondent’s negligence affected the timing of the relevant operative procedure but did not affect the relevant risk of that procedure; namely, the risk of a child suffering the catastrophic consequences of the CVST that Keeden Waller suffered following his birth.
	
	
	It was accepted by the primary judge that, but for the respondent’s negligence, the appellants would not have undergone the IVF procedure when they did (using Mr Waller’s sperm, as they did). Therefore, factual causation was established. But for the respondent’s negligence, they would not have had a child at the time that they did, let alone one with ATD or one which suffered the injuries and disabilities that Keeden suffered.
	
	
	However, the risk of those injuries and disabilities is a risk that is present in every pregnancy. Therefore, whenever they undertook the IVF procedure (and whether or not they undertook that procedure using Mr Waller’s sperm or donated sperm), the risk remained.
	
	
	The appellants’ primary case was based on the contention that Keeden’s disabilities were causally connected with his inheritance of the ATD gene. The appellants failed to prove that was the case and do not challenge the primary judge’s finding on that aspect of the matter.
	
	
	No loss was suffered as a result of the fact that the risk of having a baby with the inherited ATD gene, about which they were not properly warned, came home.
	
	
	Acceptance of the appellants’ argument in this case would make a person in the respondent’s position effectively the insurer of any pregnancy resulting from the IVF procedure undertaken at a time when the parents were not fully informed of a particular genetic risk that they were not prepared to run, whether or not the baby resulting from that procedure had inherited the relevant gene, because on that hypothesis the couple’s right to plan their family was infringed or harmed by the provision of insufficient information. The suggestion that the respondent might be liable for the whole of the costs of child-raising because the parents had undertaken a procedure that they would not otherwise have done at that particular time, is not one that readily commends itself.
	
	
	The appellants reject the suggestion that Paul v Cooke is analogous based on the serendipity of the timing of the respective operative procedures in that case but they nevertheless press their claim on the basis that part of the right being protected was the right to time when to undertake the IVF procedure. They maintain that on a normative causation approach, they should not have been shut out of their damages, at the very least to the extent of the cost of rearing and maintaining a child without the disabilities and injuries Keeden had suffered.
	
	
	When talking about the right to plan a family, in an IVF context and not in a failed sterilisation case, one is really talking about a choice of undergoing a procedure. Not all IVF procedures are successful. The analogy with Paul v Cooke is apposite because one is talking of the time at which the appellants chose to have a procedure that may or may not have resulted in a baby (healthy or otherwise and with or without an inherited ATD gene), but where the general risks inherent in pregnancy and childbirth remained the same.
	
	
	The policy underlying imposition of a duty to warn or advise in the medical context, as recognised in Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 215 CLR 375 at [8], is to equip the patient with the information relevant to the choice the patient is to make and (see at [36]) to protect the patient from the occurrence of the physical injury the risk of which is unacceptable to the patient. Here, although what was unacceptable to the appellants was the risk of the ATD gene being inherited by any child resulting from the IVF procedure, no injury or disability was shown to have been suffered as a result.
	
	
	The catastrophic injuries and disabilities suffered by Keeden shortly after his birth must have been nothing short of a tragedy for him and his parents. Such an outcome must be every expectant parent’s nightmare. However, for the reasons explained by Beazley P, the loss the appellants suffered by having the legal and moral responsibility of rearing and maintaining Keeden thrust upon them as a result of the successful IVF procedure is not a loss for which the respondent is liable.

2702939,R v Le Grange [2015] NSWDC 187,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 3 February 2013 the offender Zachary Le Grange committed two offences of such savage cruelty that the only proper sentence which can be imposed will see him going to gaol for a very long time.
	
	
	On that day, a 46 year old woman, Ms A, went to the Anna Bay Tavern with a friend. There too was the offender. He was drinking with one of his friends. Ms A had a bit to drink. Indeed at one stage staff at the tavern stopped serving alcohol to Ms A because of her state of intoxication. The offender on the other hand was not nearly as intoxicated. Staff members who observed him said that he was not unsteady and his speech was unaffected by alcohol. Indeed one staff member regarded him as sober at closing time.
	
	
	During the course of the evening there had been some brief interactions between Ms A and the offender. As they left the tavern there were further brief interactions. It is apparent that the offender had, by this stage, determined that he would follow Ms A.
	
	
	Ms A has a very poor recollection of what really occurred to her because of the violence inflicted upon her by the offender. She recalls walking down the road and being pushed or hit from behind. Her next recollection is of waking up to find herself lying in the street, dressed only in her singlet and shirt with her face bloody and swollen. In fact her face was so swollen she had trouble seeing through her swollen eyelids. She could not see well enough to retrieve her mobile telephone so she crawled on her hands and knees feeling around for her handbag. Eventually she located it and was able to call the triple 0 service and ask for help.
	
	
	When police arrived they found Ms A naked from the waist down sitting with her head bowed. Her face was matted with blood. Her face was so swollen that police who obtained a photograph from her driver’s licence could not even identify Ms A. A paramedic asked Ms A if she thought she had been sexually assaulted but she said she did not know. She had difficulty in speaking and her speech was difficult to understand. She was taken to hospital where she was found to have a number of significant injuries. She had a significantly swollen left eye, a significantly swollen left side of her face with tenderness to her left jaw, a cut over her mouth, significantly swollen underjaw and neck, tenderness to the left side collarbone and ribs, tenderness to the back of the neck and lower back, bumpy swelling to the left temple visible on CT scan, fracture of the jaw bone in front of the left ear with dislocation of the joint and bruising to both eyes. Surgical intervention was required to correct the broken jaw. A plate and screws were inserted.
	
	
	She was also found to have suffered a brain injury as a result of what the offender did to her. She had difficulty with speech articulation and swallowing. She had loss of sensation to the lower part of the left hand side of the face. Her traumatic brain injury was described as being of moderate severity and an extensive period of supervision was required.
	
	
	Police investigations found her clothing, the offender’s thongs, a rock surrounded by a pool of blood and most importantly revealed semen inside Ms A’s vagina, the DNA of which matched a DNA sample provided by the offender when he was spoken to by police.
	
	
	To say that the offences were serious is very much an understatement. The offender has now pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and sexual intercourse without consent. The maximum penalty for the first matter is 25 years’ imprisonment. For the second it is 14 years’ imprisonment. They both have standard non-parole periods of seven years’ imprisonment attached to them. I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	It almost goes without saying, but it is worth repeating, that people should be entitled to go out to a pub and have a few drinks and walk the short distance to their home safely without being set upon by people such as the offender who, for reasons which are difficult to understand, thought it appropriate to rape Ms A and to bash her with a rock.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the effects of these offences upon Ms A have been significant. She has prepared a victim impact statement. Despite its brevity, it is one of the most eloquent victim impact statements I have ever seen. I will read it in its entirety. Ms A says:
	


“It’s affected my entire life. My trust. My personality. I no longer have confidence to do things I would normally do. I am lost. It’s affected everything.”

 


	
	I can quite understand why Ms A expresses those sentiments. It is well known that offences of this kind have lasting and probably life-long effects on the victims of such offences.
	
	
	Ms A was vulnerable when she was attacked by this offender. She was, as I have mentioned, intoxicated. She was alone. She was either unconscious while the offender had sexual intercourse with her or, at the very least, her mental faculties were diminished. There is no doubt that at some stage the offender hit her with a rock. Whether he did this beforehand, so that he could rape her, or afterwards as an act of completely unnecessary violence, we will never know. It is hard to know which alternative is worse.
	
	
	It is also apparent that the offender simply walked off after having treated Ms A so badly, leaving her clearly injured with no apparent means of assistance. It was not he who rang triple 0, even anonymously. It was for Ms A who eventually regained consciousness to have to feel around for her phone in the manner I have described earlier.
	
	
	These offences very much came out of the blue for the offender. He has only one relatively minor matter on his criminal history, an offence of common assault and, as the references tendered before me today attest, he is a man of good character in many respects. He did have some troubles, particularly with drugs, as he was growing up but he told a psychiatrist that he had given up drugs in the period leading up to these offences. His behaviour had changed in a positive way after his son was born. So it must have come as a complete surprise to those who thought they knew him that he was capable of acting in such a horrible and nasty way towards another human being.
	
	
	The offender’s upbringing was less than perfect. His mother was a drug addict who apparently thought there was little wrong with using drugs in the presence of her children. On the other hand, he had a very good relationship with his father. His parents separated, I gather because of his mother’s drug use and other adverse behaviour, when he was relatively young. His father has remarried. Although there were some problems in the relationship between the offender and his stepmother these do not appear to have been anything out of the ordinary. He retains the support, very much so, of his father and other family members, despite the awful offences which he has committed.
	
	
	He left school relatively early because he wanted to work for his father. He has been doing that and some of the references speak quite highly of his work ethic when working with his father.
	
	
	Just before committing these offences he entered into a relationship which produced the child I spoke about earlier. Some time before these offences he was in trouble as far as his drug use is concerned. At times he was mentally unwell, attending mental health facilities for treatment and medication but what was described by his stepmother as a turning point for the offender apparently came about when he learnt that his partner was pregnant. He did change and so these offences did come out of the blue.
	
	
	Quite why he committed these offences is difficult to determine. The offender claims not to have any memory of the events. I reject that immediately. His level of intoxication would not explain an absence of memory. He suffered no injury himself. I am satisfied that he knows exactly what happened and is refusing to tell people because he does not want to have to answer the question “why did you do it?”. I have no answer to that question. Psychologists suggest that perhaps this was misplaced anger in the context of some minor dispute with his partner but the truth is, no-one really knows. That is of course a relevant matter in determining the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. How can Mr Le Grange be rehabilitated when no-one really knows why he committed the offence in the first place. I certainly cannot say his prospects of rehabilitation are good. I note that the static 99 test suggests he is in a high risk of offending. Of course whilst that test says something about populations, it says little about an individual offender. Perhaps more importantly, as I have said repeatedly, these offences came without warning and no-one really knows why he did what he did.
	
	
	It is obvious that a substantial component of general deterrence has to be built in to any sentence imposed upon the offender. Similarly, personal deterrence is important. The offender needs to have brought home to him in a very concrete way just how wrong his conduct was.
	
	
	He has expressed his remorse to others, although there are two qualifications to that. Firstly, he did not give sworn evidence today before me. I am left to rely on what he said to others and, secondly, his feigned inability to recall what happened suggests that there are some limits to the offender’s willingness to face up to the consequences of his behaviour.
	
	
	In assessing the seriousness of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, I take into account the nature of the form of intercourse penile/vaginal, the circumstance that the offender ejaculated inside Ms A’s vagina, that after the offence was completed he left her very vulnerable, semi-naked and injured at the side of the road, and that when he was actually having sexual intercourse with her she was either unconscious or at the very least not in full possession of her faculties.
	
	
	I should speak about delay. It is apparent that this matter has been in the courts for some time, more than is clearly desirable, but a large part of the delay is due to applications made for adjournments on behalf of the offender as medical matters were investigated. As it turns out, nothing of significance was found. I do not at all criticise the lawyers for making such applications so that investigations can be made, but the reasons for the delay of which I have spoken suggest that there should be no significant mitigation of the punishment upon Mr Le Grange because of those delays.
	
	
	Of course there needs to be a level of accumulation. A significant level too. Each of these offences, whilst committed at about the same time, focuses on a very different aspect of the offender’s behaviour. On the other hand it would be wrong for me to impose entirely concurrent sentences. There will be a substantial level of partial accumulation.
	
	
	I will take into account the offender’s pre-sentence custody. It is agreed that the sentence I will shortly announce should commence on 15 February 2013. I do not consider that there are any special circumstances in this case beyond the necessity for a mathematical adjustment of the sentences to ensure that the overall sentence reflects the statutory ratio. As the Crown has accurately pointed out, the length of sentence which I must impose will provide a sufficient level of eligibility for parole and, in any case, the effective non-parole period I will announce is the minimum which properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	I sentence the offender as follows. For the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six years commencing from 15 February 2013 and a head sentence of nine years. For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six years commencing from 15 February 2016 and a head sentence of nine years. The overall effective sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of nine years commencing from 15 February 2013 and a head sentence of 12 years. The offender will become eligible to be released on parole on 14 February 2022.

2702940,R v Strbac [2015] NSWDC 268,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a relatively young man who had a problem with cannabis. He used to take it when he was even younger. He got married and quit the habit but a month after he was married he was in a serious work accident and he spent some time in hospital. As a result of this he commenced the habit again but more intensely. The accident also caused him to lose money so he decided to grow cannabis at the back of his house. The cannabis plantation was found by the police and he was charged with the offence that I am sentencing him for.
	
	
	The young man’s name is Stevan Strbac. He has been charged with cultivating the commercial quantity of a prohibited plant, namely cannabis. That is an offence against s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament regards it as a serious offence. It has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to the offence.
	
	
	Mr Strbac has asked me to take into account another offece when I am sentencing him. The other offence is using electricity without authority. That is made a crime by s 64 of the Electricity Supply Act 1995. Again, Parliament regards it as serious and has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment to the offence.
	
	
	Mr Strbac pleaded guilty to the charge at what the prosecution agreed was the earliest available opportunity. The law in this State encourages such guilty pleas by offering a discount. A plea at the stage that Mr Strbac entered it attracts a discount of 25% from sentence. In due course I will discount his sentence by 25%.
	
	
	First I should briefly say what happened. Police turned up at Mr Strbac’s house in South Wentworthville on 2 October 2014 with a search warrant. They found three sheds in the back yard of the house. There was a relatively sophisticated cannabis plantation in two of the sheds. There were transformers. There were 68 plants in one shed and 32 plants in another. The third shed was for storage. There were lamps and light shades and an illegal electricity bypass. The hundred cannabis plants have an estimated street value of nearly $300,000. Mr Strbac admitted his offence immediately.
	
	
	It is important in sentencing an offender not only to refer to what happened, but also to refer to the personal circumstances of the offender. Mr Strbac has no previous convictions. Not only that, he has a series of references from family and friends which point out that he is remorseful for what he has done and has struggled successfully through his life, which started off in very difficult circumstances. He is well regarded by his family and friends.
	
	
	Ms L C Hutchinson of counsel who appeared for Mr Strbac called her client to give evidence. He was involved in the conflict arising from the break-up of the former country of Yugoslavia. His father was killed in the conflict and he fled as a refugee to Australia with his mother and a brother. The conflict obviously had a traumatic impact on him as a child. Those impacts have been recorded to some extent by a psychiatrist, Dr John Albert Roberts, who prepared a report and more so by a psychologist, Laura Durkin, who also prepared a report.
	
	
	Mr Strbac has a good work history in Australia and, as I said, got engaged and married. He had taken cannabis as a teenager and in his early 20’s. He stopped taking it, but a month after his wedding there was an industrial accident which rendered him incapacitated - I have seen a graphic photograph of his injured foot - for some months. This meant that his wife had to care for him. There were issues to do with the payment of compensation and pressure for him not to stay in hospital. According to Mr Strbac’s wife - who was also called to give evidence - that pressure came from his employer and was related to the employer’s liability. The impact of the injury was significant. He was physically incapacitated. It affected his mood and outlook on life. Mrs Strbac described how he became depressed, emotional, ill-tempered and uncommunicative. Related to this was the expectation - perhaps cultural, but nevertheless important - that he would be the breadwinner for him and his wife. Mr Strbac could not discharge that assumed responsibility. He started smoking cannabis again.
	
	
	There is a related factor that I need to explain. The custom in Mr Strbac’s cultural community on getting married is that the young couple are provided with cash for them to build their future. This happened to the Strbacs when they were married. However, because of the slowness of being paid by the insurance company and the lack of funds, they found that they had to spend most of their money, almost $40,000, in simply supporting themselves. In other words, the gifted capital fund had to be used simply to keep them going, rather than contributing in some significant way to their future. This again bothered Mr Strbac very much.
	
	
	When Mr Strbac took up the habit of cannabis again, he was smoking a lot. He was at home. His wife was looking after him for a while but then she returned to work. Mr Strbac decided that he needed to make up for the loss of the capital fund. He decided to do this by growing cannabis in the back yard. That explains what the police found.
	
	
	Mr P Low, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, cross-examined Mr Strbac about how much money he would have made from the cash crop. It must be, at best, an estimate, but what is clear is that he would make far more than the loss of $40,000 or so in the gifted capital. The figure he might make would be closer to $100,000 or more. Mr Strbac was also, of course, supporting his own habit and was quite enterprising in cloning plants to get to the eventual number of about 100 that the police found.
	
	
	Dr Roberts diagnosed Mr Strbac with a “substance use disorder” in current remission but also noted that he is “suffering from chronic pain arising as a result of a physical injury” which was a factor in substantially aggravating his level of marijuana use in order to obtain pain relief”. Dr Roberts provided a treatment plan which would involve abstinence from cannabis and regular testing. The testing has proved negative in the sense that it has not disclosed any further use of cannabis. In his recent report of 21 July 2015, Dr Roberts said that Mr Strbac “appears to be making a significant effort in regard to dealing with his substance use disorder”.
	
	
	Laura Durkin, the psychologist, thought that Mr Strbac “does not present with many risk factors for offending”. She accepted his account that he was “a relatively stable individual who has never before been in contact with the criminal justice system”. Although not diagnosing a condition, Ms Durkin suggested that Mr Strbac “has resorted to inappropriate means of coping, namely smoking cannabis, to manage distressing emotions and to avoid feelings of boredom”. Ms Durkin made observations about disclosure by Mr Strbac to her of what she called “permissive beliefs about the use of cannabis”. Mr Strbac said under oath in the witness box that he no longer holds those beliefs because he has educated himself about the impact of illegal cannabis use within the community. The amount of money that he was going to make from the cannabis would not only far exceed the loss he sustained but would, he told Ms Durkin, help him towards purchasing a house.
	
	
	Mrs Strbac is pregnant and is due to give birth very soon.
	
	
	The essence of Ms Hutchsinson’s submissions on behalf of her client was that Mr Strbac’s moral culpability was reduced by the fact that he was driven by his addiction. Unlike other cases where an offender’s decision to grow a commercial crop was a soberly assessed enterprise - for example R v Heffernan [2014] NSWDC 302, a man whom I sentenced last year in Newcastle - Ms Hutchinson argued that her client’s behaviour was driven by the addiction, so that its objective seriousness was reduced by that motivational factor.
	
	
	Ms Hutchinson emphasised the impact which the injury and incapacity had on her client’s emotions and relationship with his wife. The decision to grow this crop was made in that environment of a great amount of pain, high emotions, disappointment and a failure to meet expectations. She pointed to the fact that Mr Strbac had given up the habit and started again after the injury, but in a much more driven way.
	
	
	Ms Hutchinson referred to Mr Strbac’s traumatic past and argued in her written submissions (which became MFI 1) that there is a link between his “diminished emotional responses and his traumatic youth” such that her client “should bear a lesser moral responsibility for his offending, than would those with a normal or advantaged upbringing”. There is some force in that submission. Ms Hutchinson has made out, I agree, a causal connection between his addiction and his offending, which affects the objective seriousness, as I have already observed. It was a very ill-considered enterprise driven by a man who was in very vulnerable circumstances. Ms Hutchinson pointed to her client’s good character and prospects of rehabilitation, his strong work ethic and his expressed remorse.
	
	
	Mr Low, on the other hand, emphasised the distinction between Mr Strbac’s motivation when he started growing the cannabis and later on as he persevered to eventually reach 100 plants. The decision to commence the cultivation may have been driven by the factors referred to by Ms Hutchinson, but the continuation of the enterprise, Mr Low said, pointed to its objective seriousness being higher.
	
	
	Mr Low acknowledged the impact of the pressures from the employer, the insurer and the personal shame and pain which Mr Strbac experienced. I also emphasise that Mr Strbac alone was undertaking this enterprise and simply did it in order to improve his financial position. He was not only wanting to make up what he lost but earn, so to speak, far in excess.
	
	
	As I said, the maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment. Mr Strbac’s offence is of cultivating a commercial number of plants. The number he cultivated – 100 - was twice the minimum amount for a commercial quantity and half the amount for a large commercial quantity. It was, to my mind, therefore a significant amount and should ordinarily attract a significant sentence.
	
	
	However, Ms Hutchinson drew my attention to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160. That was also a case of cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis. The number of plants in that case was three times as many, over 300. The sentencing judge in that case took into account an offence of possessing a prohibited drug. In addition, the offender in that case obviously had a criminal record but, more significantly, was on a good behaviour bond when he committed the offence. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of three years and two months on Mr Godden. Having reviewed the authorities Hall J, speaking on behalf of Hunt AJ and Grove J, observed at [20] that -
	


“The sentence of three years and two months with a non‑parole period of two years imposed on the applicant for the offence charged under s.23(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985, having regard the particular facts of the case, must, in my opinion, be regarded as a very substantial one.”


	
	His Honour proposed that the sentence on Mr Godden be reduced to two years and two months and that was the order of the court. In R v Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 94, Hulme J referred to Godden and raised a question based on certain assumptions about its correctness. However McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J did not agree with Hulme J’s observation.
	
	
	On comparison between Mr Strbac’s case and Mr Godden’s case, it seems to me that Mr Strbac’s case is less serious. Mr Strbac’s involved a third of the number of plants and in Mr Godden’s case a more significant drug offence was taken into account. There was also the significantly aggravating feature of the offender being in breach of a good behaviour bond.
	
	
	For those reasons it seems to me that a sentence of two and-a-half years for Mr Strbac would be an appropriate starting point. I regard that as appropriate taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence and his personal circumstances, including his prospects of rehabilitation. I take into account his wife’s pregnancy and the imminent birth of their first child as just another subjective matter rather than a feature which would have significant weight, or any weight, in altering the kind of sentence I would impose.
	
	
	Because Mr Strbac pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity I would discount the two and-a-half year sentence by 25%, thus reducing the sentence and rounding it off to one of 22 months imprisonment. I will now hear the parties on the manner in which that sentence should be served.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Hutchinson?

HUTCHINSON: Your Honour, for the reasons that were canvassed in evidence and in particular on account of Mr Strbac’s need, that is a strong need for rehabilitation, his proved success at efforts to rehabilitate himself and his prospects of rehabilitation, as that expression is understood in s 3A of the Sentencing Act, I submit that in all of the circumstances your Honour could find that it is, I believe the phrase is appropriate in all of the circumstances, if your Honour requires the particular wording I can have it, that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that that sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I need an assessment don’t I?

HUTCHINSON: Yes, if your Honour were to so find then the procedure today would be to make an order referring him for assessment, which in turn would bind him to make contact with the appropriate office--

HIS HONOUR: Let’s hear what Mr Low says about that proposal.

LOW: I have nothing further to add to my submissions your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Low.


	
	I agree with the submission just made by Ms Hutchinson. Her client’s prospects of rehabilitation are good and he needs rehabilitation. His efforts to date are very positive. I should have added in my remarks on sentence that because of the seriousness of the offence I regard no sentence other than imprisonment as being appropriate. However the question of how the sentence is served is a separate issue and I propose to refer Mr Strbac for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community. Accordingly the order which I make is this.
	
	
	Under s 69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I refer Mr Strbac for assessment as to the suitability of him for intensive correction in the community.
	


HIS HONOUR: So that needs an adjournment I assume and he comes back before me in how much?

LOW: At least six weeks your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Sounds like October again.

DISCUSSION AS TO DATES

HUTCHINSON: Your Honour, my learned friend has just clarified that ordinarily with the referral under s 69 of the Act so too is there an ancillary order made that Mr Strbac would attend within a certain number of days on his local office.

HIS HONOUR: Yes and what’s his local office?

HUTCHINSON: Fairfield is the relevant Community Corrections Office and whether that were for the next seven or within the next seven or 10 days, either would be suitable.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Now when’s the baby due?

LOW: It’s in the next seven to 10 days.

HUTCHINSON: 20 August.

HIS HONOUR: All right. I’ve given the direction.


	
	I adjourn the proceedings to Friday, 23 October 2015 at 10am before me in Sydney. I direct Mr Strbac to attend the Community Corrections Office at Fairfield within the next seven days, on or before next Friday 14 August 2015, for the purposes of commencing the assessment. Bail is continued on the same conditions as presently fixed.
	


LOW: The intensive correction order’s usually prepared slightly ahead of that time, your Honour. If he is suitable for it may I be excused on the next occasion?

HIS HONOUR: Yes is the answer, provided your client, the Director, is legally represented, yes.

LOW: As always, your Honour. Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Good. Okay. I will direct my associate, once the ICO arrives to forward a copy to both of you. There’s a blue form coming your client’s way, Ms Hutchinson. Continuation of bail. Anything else?

HUTCHINSON: Not from our perspective.

LOW: Just an order for the destruction of the plants and equipment, your Honour.


	
	I make an order under a section of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act that my associate will specify in a formal order for the destruction of the prohibited plants and any associated equipment.
	


HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Strbac, I’ve heard what Ms Hutchinson has had to say and I’ve given you a sentence of 22 months imprisonment but we are going to see whether you can serve that by way of intensive correction in the community. That means that it will be very inconvenient for you and you will be under lots of restrictions and you’ll have to do some community service probably. That’s going to involve you in 22 months of a very restricted life and every day of that you will be thinking, as you are at home with your wife and family hopefully, your son or daughter, that you are far better off at home than at Long Bay or Silverwater, or somewhere further off in gaol. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That is the point. Ms Hutchinson will explain that to you and you will come back to Court on 23 October. In the meantime your bail is on the same conditions, whatever they are and a form will come to you in a moment for you to sign. Do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes I do.

REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 22 November 2012, Michele Kathleen Moore (Ms Moore) and Brendan James Price (Mr Price), who are husband and wife, were arrested and charged with the murder of Dennis Burns (Mr Burns).
	
	
	Three weeks earlier, on 1 November 2012, Mr James Moore, the 24 year old son of Ms Moore, was charged with the murder of Mr Burns.
	
	
	After being committed for trial by the Local Court at Coffs Harbour on 14 November 2013, Ms Moore and Mr Price upon arraignment in this Court on 7 March 2014, each entered a plea of not guilty.
	
	
	Ultimately they were arraigned before a jury on 4 May 2015. Again, they each pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, and the trial proceeded.
	
	
	On Wednesday 20 May 2015, the jury returned a verdict against each of Ms Moore and Mr Price of guilty of murder. A conviction for the offence was entered against each of them by the Court on that day.
	
	
	Ms Moore and Mr Price now stand to be sentenced for their crime.
	
	
	The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of life imprisonment for the offence of murder. A standard non-parole period of 20 years is fixed by the legislation. The maximum term and the standard non-parole period stand as legislative guideposts for the purpose of the determination of an appropriate sentence [1] .
	


Principal Offence


	
	On 28 October 2012, an argument conducted over the telephone and by text message, occurred between the deceased, Mr Burns, and Mr James Moore.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Moore is the 24 year old son of the offender, Ms Moore, and the step-son of the offender, Mr Price.
	
	
	Mr James Moore assaulted Mr Burns outside the house in which he, Mr Burns, was squatting in Collingwood Street, Coffs Harbour. The weapon used by Mr Moore was a wooden mattock handle, approximately 900mm long. Mr Moore struck a number of blows to Mr Burns. He caused fractures to his right hand, left ulna, a number of ribs, the sternum, and ultimately a fracture to the left vertex and right fronto-temporal areas of Mr Burns’ skull. This skull fracture was caused by a blow directly to Mr Burns’ head whilst he was prostrate on the ground. It caused a 70mm laceration to Mr Burns’ scalp and an extensive acute subdural haematoma. This final blow, the skull fracture and the subdural haematoma caused the death of Mr Burns two days later in John Hunter Hospital, when his life support system was turned off.
	
	
	This conduct by Mr James Moore led to his conviction for murder.
	
	
	The Crown case against Ms Moore and Mr Price was not that either of them struck the fatal blow, but rather that each of them encouraged and assisted Mr Moore in his brutal assault on Mr Burns, and were themselves guilty of murder because they were aiders and abetters to the principal offence of murder by Mr James Moore.
	


Judicial Task on Sentencing


	
	The principles of law which a sentencing Judge must apply are of long standing and are well identified.
	
	
	The first principle is that following a conviction after trial by jury, the Judge has the responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender, not the jury.
	
	
	Secondly, in order to determine the appropriate punishment, it is the duty of the Judge to find the facts relevant to that sentencing.
	
	
	Thirdly, in so doing, the facts that are determined must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. But, it is not appropriate for a sentencing Judge to attempt to decipher why, or how, the jury came to its decision. Rather, it is the role of the Judge to find facts which are consistent with the jury’s verdict.
	
	
	Fourthly, any findings of fact made against either of the offenders, must be made on the basis that the sentencing Judge is satisfied of those facts beyond reasonable doubt. Where an offender has the onus of proving a fact or facts for the purpose of sentence, then the sentencing Judge need only be satisfied of that fact on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	It is important to note that there is no requirement falling generally onto a sentencing Judge that the offender must be sentenced on the basis of the facts which are most favourable to her or him. The reality may be, however, since the sentencing Judge must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of a fact before a finding against an offender, that an offender will be sentenced on the basis of facts most favourable to them [2] .
	
	
	It is important to explain that sentencing is not a formulaic exercise, nor one involving the application of mathematical precision leading to a single correct result. The obligation on the sentencing Judge is to determine the appropriate facts relating to the offence, identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing in a particular case, evaluate their significance, and then to make a judgment as to what an appropriate sentence is, having regard to the objectives of sentencing [3] .
	


Sentencing Objectives


	
	The Parliament of NSW has set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender. A sentencing Judge is obliged, so far as it is possible, in formulating a sentence to take into account and give weight to each of these purposes.
	
	
	The purposes of sentencing determined by the Parliament are:
	



	
	to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
	
	
	to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
	
	
	to protect the community from the offender;
	
	
	to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
	
	
	to make the offender accountable for his or her actions;
	
	
	to denounce the conduct of the offender; and
	
	
	to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	



	
	It is self-evident that these purposes overlap, may be in conflict and cannot be considered in isolation one from the other in their application to a particular case. These purposes do not rank in any order of priority.
	
	
	As well, the Court is obliged to have regard to the Common Law principles which have been developed over time by courts to provide guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every Judge.
	
	
	Of particular relevance here are two of those principles. The first is that any sentence which is imposed should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence [4] .
	
	
	The second is the principle of parity, namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance and to give to the appearance that justice has not been done [5] .
	
	
	Finally, the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are also applicable here. That legislation calls attention to matters which are regarded by the Parliament of NSW as aggravating factors to be considered by a court, and other matters which are regarded by the Parliament of NSW to be mitigating factors to be taken into account by the Court.
	


Principal Offender


	
	As is apparent from my earlier remarks, Mr James Moore, was the principal offender in the death of Mr Burns. He was the one who wielded the wooden mattock handle which directly caused the death of Mr Burns when it struck his head.
	
	
	On 28 November 2014, Mr Moore was convicted of murder by a jury. On 13 March 2015, he was sentenced to imprisonment for an overall term of 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. His sentence commenced from the date of his arrest on 1 November 2012.
	


The Facts


	
	I make the following findings of fact, which are consistent with the jury’s verdict and which reflect my view that both Ms Moore and Mr Price encouraged and assisted Mr James Moore, in various ways, to the commit the offence of murder.
	
	
	Ms Moore submitted to the jury that she had acted to defend herself from the knife-wielding Mr Burns. Mr Price submitted to the jury that he acted to defend Ms Moore against a physical attack from Mr Burns. It must follow from the verdicts of the jury, that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that neither Ms Moore or Mr Price were acting in self-defence. My findings of fact will reflect this conclusion.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr James Moore was 24 years old at the time he killed Mr Burns. Mr Burns, the deceased, was aged 47 when he died. Mr Moore and Mr Burns had known each other for some time and were associated in the world of illicit drugs. The text messages between them at the time support a conclusion that Mr Moore, from time to time, supplied cannabis to Mr Burns.
	
	
	Mr Burns was living, as a squatter, in a house at 47 Collingwood Street, Coffs Harbour, which was apparently abandoned by its owners. He seemed to live there by himself and the photos of the premises suggest that he had established himself there in a modest but comfortable way.
	
	
	On the morning of 28 October 2012, Mr Moore visited a drug supplier in Woolgoolga – a town to the north of Coffs Harbour. He offered to purchase drugs for Mr Burns, but indicated to him that there would be an increase in the price of the cannabis that he was purchasing in an amount of $20 per ounce. Mr Burns was offended by the price increase and a dispute ensued between Mr James Moore and Mr Burns. That dispute was no doubt contributed to by Mr Burns drinking significant quantities of alcohol, which usually caused him to become aggressive.
	
	
	Upon his return from visiting his drug dealer, the communications between Mr James Moore and Mr Burns continued, but their tone degenerated significantly. The tone, largely on the part of Mr Burns, became increasingly aggressive, offensive and tended to incoherence. At one point, Mr Burns threatened to sexually assault Mr James Moore’s heavily pregnant partner. This, no doubt, aggravated the situation.
	
	
	At about 3.00pm Mr James Moore, seemingly in an attempt to calm things down, sent Mr Burns a text which said
	


“one more bad call or text, this is your warning, pull up”.


	
	At around that time, Mr James Moore contacted his mother, who was then at her home with her husband Mr Price. I am satisfied that they discussed what was going on, and either Mr James Moore sought the assistance of his mother, or else she offered to assist him. Ms Michele Moore made contact with Mr Burns via a text message which read:
	


“Don’t f*** with people you don’t know. James, mum and dad f***wit go it”


	
	It was clearly Ms Michele Moore’s intention was to involve herself in the dispute between Mr Burns and her son. She wanted to make it appear that her son had the support of both herself and Mr Price, and that Mr Burns should know that he was confronting all of the members of the family and not just Mr James Moore.
	
	
	This is made clear a few minutes later when, after a further discussion of the matter with her son over the telephone, Ms Moore sent a text message to Mr Burns which, omitting profanities, read
	


“You got a problem with James, you got a problem with his kin and we no Fernando too dickhead” (sic).


	
	A little later, at 3.32pm, Mr James Moore sent his mother a text saying
	


“He’s still going, says he waiting for me and says I’m out of town and says I’m a big girl hiding behind mummy”.


	
	About 10 minutes later, Mr James Moore sent a further text to his mother saying:
	


“Still going right on with it”.


	
	Very shortly after that, about a minute or so later, Mr James Moore sent a text to his mother, which read as follows:
	


“I want to go kick his teeth in, its message after message”.


	
	At 4.13pm, at a time when Ms Moore and Mr Price were driving from their home to collect James Moore from his home, Mr James Moore sent what seems to have been the final text message to his mother saying:
	


“He keeps calling and calling over and over saying bad s*** and saying ‘come on where are you’ ”.


	
	Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price lived about six minute drive from her son’s house. It was about an eight minute drive from her son’s house to where Mr Burns lived.
	
	
	Ms Michele Moore, fired up over the way in which Mr Burns was dealing with her son, and apparently concerned for her son’s well-being, decided that she would take her son down to confront Mr Burns in order to resolve the festering dispute.
	
	
	She armed herself with a hobby hammer before leaving her house. Mr Price got into the car. It is unlikely that he saw the hammer which Ms Michele Moore carried from the house to the car. There was a fishing rod in the car which Mr Price later used as an implement in the attack on Mr Burns. They drove from their house to collect Mr James Moore. When they arrived at his house at about 4.15pm, Mr James Moore was waiting for them and was holding a wooden mattock handle. This implement was obviously solid and obviously dangerous. It was a little under 1m in length. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price could see the mattock handle being carried by Mr James Moore to the car. Mr Moore got into the car and the three of them drove together to Mr Burns’ house.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that Mr Price knew of the precise content of the text messages which I have described, nor the contents of the telephone calls between his wife and her son. However, I am not prepared to accept that he had absolutely no knowledge of what was going on. It is inevitable that he knew in general terms that there was a dispute between Mr Burns on the one hand, and his step-son and wife on the other. He knew that, as a group of three adults, they were going down to confront Mr Burns and that Mr James Moore was armed with the wooden mattock handle.
	
	
	When he got out of the car at the scene, Mr Price took the fishing rod with him. At that point in time, I am satisfied that he knew that the proposed confrontation would likely be a violent one, and he armed himself with an available weapon.
	
	
	I am well satisfied that Ms Michele Moore knew at a slightly earlier time namely, when she picked Mr James Moore up from his house, and whilst she was driving Mr James Moore to the house in Collingwood Street, that he intended to assault Mr Burns and, having regard to the nature of the weapon which he was carrying, that any assault would be likely to cause serious physical injury. One blow of the mattock handle wielded by a much younger and stronger man against an older man would have been likely to cause serious physical injury. So much was obvious. It must have been, and I am satisfied was, known to Ms Moore.
	
	
	It was Ms Michele Moore’s case that she was going to defuse the situation in an attempt to achieve a peaceful outcome. I reject that proposition. A mother does not drive her son, whom she knows is armed with a weapon capable of causing serious harm, and whom she knows to have violent tendencies, to the scene of a confrontation when she herself is armed, albeit with a small weapon. At no time after she arrived at the scene did she do anything which remotely suggested that she went there to attempt to make peace with Mr Burns.
	
	
	Upon arrival at the scene there was a confrontation. Each of the participants in this confrontation was armed in one way or another. Mr James Moore had the wooden mattock handle, Ms Michele Moore had a hobby hammer and Mr Price was carrying a fishing rod which was 1.75m long. The deceased, Mr Burns, was armed with a number of knives.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the initial confrontation was between Ms Michele Moore and the deceased. She was yelling very aggressively at the deceased from about 30cm away. She was “… in his face …”.  She was using a loud voice which was heard by people up to 50m away. There was some physical shoving between them. The deceased produced his knife or knives, and threatened Ms Moore with them. The group moved out towards the middle of the roadway, and then back to the grass verge and driveway area of the deceased’s house. It was a dynamic situation.
	
	
	After Ms Michele Moore was initially threatened, both Mr James Moore and Mr Price stepped forward and threatened to hit the deceased. At a point in time early in the course of the confrontation, and after an initial blow had been delivered by Mr James Moore, Ms Michele Moore stepped forward and hit the deceased on his forehead with the hammer. This caused a laceration to the deceased’s scalp and a good deal of blood flowed from the laceration and dripped onto the hammer, which Ms Michele Moore then dropped.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards, as the deceased produced another knife, Mr James Moore struck the deceased with a series of blows. The first blows, aimed at the deceased’s right hand and left arm, disarmed him and caused bony fractures to the hand and forearm of the deceased who fell to his knees. Although injured by these blows, he managed to get up.
	
	
	At this time, the offender Mr Price stepped forward and, over a relatively short time period, struck the deceased four times with the fishing rod that he was carrying. These blows landed on the outside of the deceased’s upper back. At that point in time, Mr Burns must have been leaning forward, bent at about the waist. He was certainly not in an aggressive stance.
	
	
	A further series of blows were then delivered by Mr James Moore to Mr Burns. Those blows caused the balance of his injuries and caused the deceased to fall to the ground where Mr Moore administered the final blow causing his death. As Mr Moore was inflicting these blows, he was heard to say on two occasions that he was going to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The blows delivered to the deceased by Mr James Moore were done with significant and severe force. It was a brutal and unremitting assault.
	
	
	The blow delivered by Ms Michele Moore to the deceased’s head was done with moderate force. It was not a “slight tap” on his head as she claimed to investigating police.
	
	
	The blows delivered to the deceased by Mr Price were delivered with, what I would judge to be, moderate force because of the clear and obvious marks which they left on the deceased’s body.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the assault, the three perpetrators left the scene. Mr Price and Ms Michele Moore left slightly before Mr James Moore. They all walked west up Ulmarra Lane. As they did so, Ms Moore instructed her son, Mr James Moore, to dispose of the mattock handle in an adjoining property. Mr Price did not hear that instruction. The offender, Mr Price, disposed of his fishing rod and a broad-brimmed hat which he was wearing. He also removed his shirt.
	
	
	Ms Moore then drove all three of them away from the scene of the assault.
	


Police Investigation


	
	In the course of the police investigation, both Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price gave interviews to the investigators on 30 October 2012. In Ms Michele Moore’s case, she gave a second interview on 16 November 2012. I am satisfied that both of the offenders gave a version of the facts which was largely false. Each version was intended to admit that they were at the scene, but to exculpate themselves from any culpable involvement in the death of Mr Burns.
	


Specific Statutory Considerations


	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act set outs a number of matters to which regard must be had. They are both aggravating and mitigating factors. I will identify those factors referrable to each accused, but only those factors which I regard as relevant.
	
	
	The principal offence involved the actual use of violence and the actual use of a weapon [6] . Although the use of the weapon by Mr James Moore was an integral part of the offence of murder, I regard these factors as being aggravating matters so far as Ms Michele Moore, and Mr Price are concerned because, in addition to what Mr James Moore was doing, each armed themselves with a weapon and both participated in using violence, and that weapon, in the course of the physical assault which occurred to Mr Burns. Even though their use of their weapons, and their resort to the use of violence, did not cause the death of Mr Burns, their conduct was a clear encouragement of Mr James Moore to do what he did. I regard these as aggravating factors.
	
	
	The offence of each offender was committed in company with Mr James Moore and each other. That is an aggravating factor [7] . 
	
	
	I am satisfied that although Mr Burns was a squatter in the abandoned house, nevertheless, the offence was committed in the backyard and driveway area of his home. He does not have to have had legal permission to live there for this to be regarded as an aggravating factor. This must be taken into account as an aggravating factor [8] . However, I do not regard it has having any real weight.
	
	
	Finally, it will be an aggravating factor if the offence was part of a planned criminal activity [9] .  I am satisfied that whilst there was no plan to go and kill the deceased, nevertheless it was the intention of Ms Michele Moore that she and the other two males would go and confront the deceased, having each armed themselves with a form of weapon. Mr Price was a knowing participant in the activity described in this general way.
	
	
	It was obvious to Ms Michele Moore from the time that her son got into the car, that an assault was likely to take place and she willingly participated in enabling that confrontation to occur. I am satisfied that she knew that it was Mr James Moore’s intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. After all, as she told the investigating police, she thought that Mr James Moore was going to “bash Mr Burns’ brains in”. In Ms Michele Moore’s case, I am satisfied that this assault occurred in the course of a planned criminal activity. This is an aggravating factor of real weight.
	
	
	In Mr Price’s case, I am not satisfied that he knew that the confrontation was likely to be a violent one at any time before he got out of the car at the scene. In his case, I do not think that any pre-planning is of any significance as an aggravating factor. By the time he realised what was to happen, it was so close to the events, that any notion of pre-planning does not merit being assessed as a significant aggravating factor.
	
	
	It is necessary to consider the mitigating factors so far as each of the offenders are concerned. It is convenient to do so by addressing them individually for each offender.
	
	
	Ms Michele Kathleen Moore
	
	
	It is a mitigating factor if the offence was provoked by the victim [10] . Here, there is no doubt that the offence arose from conduct of both the victim and Mr James Moore. A part of the conduct of Ms Michele Moore, namely her striking Mr Burns in the head, was in immediate retaliation for his initial physical threat to her with the knife. That is a matter relevant to the assessment of the criminality of Ms Michele Moore in this offence, but I would not regard it as a matter of provocation within the meaning of this statutory provision.
	
	
	It is an important mitigating factor that Ms Michele Moore does not have any significant record of previous convictions [11] . Ms Michele Moore’s criminal record was tendered. It consists of a number of minor offences and a minor driving offence. Whilst there is one offence involving violence, that occurred over 10 years ago and in circumstances where it does not appear that anyone was injured, I do not regard her previous criminal history as being a significant record of previous convictions. This is a mitigating factor.
	
	
	Ms Michele Moore did not suggest that she was entitled to the benefit of being considered to be a person of good character as a mitigating factor [12] . Although her past record is not significant, she cannot be regarded as a person of past good character within the meaning of the statute.
	
	
	I am persuaded that, having regard to the particular circumstances of this offence, Ms Michele Moore’s maturity, her progress since being in custody, and her general attitude to what has occurred, she is unlikely to re-offend. It follows that I am satisfied she has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Where an offender shows remorse by demonstrating that she has accepted responsibility for her actions and has acknowledged the consequences of her actions, then that can amount to a mitigating factor in the sentence imposed [13] .
	
	
	I accept Ms Michele Moore’s evidence that she feels morally responsible for what occurred and, as well, her expressions of regret with respect to what occurred. She has demonstrated her remorse.
	
	
	These last two matters are mitigating factors to which I will have regard. In the circumstances here, they are factors to which significant weight ought to be attached.
	
	
	Each of these aggravating and mitigating factors will be taken into account in considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed.
	


Mr Brendan James Price


	
	I have already dealt with the aggravating factors with respect to Mr Price.
	
	
	In considering the mitigating factors, it is important to note that a factor of considerable weight in the circumstances of Mr Price, is that prior to this offence he was a person of good character and his only conviction is for a driving offence some years ago. In his case, he is entitled to have the Court place significant weight on these two mitigating factors [14] , which I do.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that Mr Price is unlikely to re-offend, and has good prospects of rehabilitation. These are important factors to be taken into account, and to which I give significant weight [15] .
	
	
	Mr Price has not demonstrated remorse in the way required by the statute, namely by accepting responsibility for his actions, and acknowledging any of the consequences of his conduct [16] . He is not entitled to any mitigation in this respect.
	


Criminality of the Offenders


	
	It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective criminality involved in each offender’s offence. Although this is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to the offender, it will be assessed differently for Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price because they each played different roles in the circumstances of the offence [17] .
	
	
	In my assessment, Ms Moore’s criminality is serious. Knowing of the dispute between her son and the deceased, she armed herself and drove to her son’s house in order to collect him and drive him to a confrontation. She knew when she collected him that he was armed with a very substantial weapon. She knew of his intention to cause serious physical injury. She continued to drive him to the scene of the confrontation. Upon arrival she was the first to engage in a verbal confrontation with the deceased and, at an early part during the assault, struck him on the head with a hammer. She remained at the scene in close proximity to what was occurring. Then, as she and the others left together, she advised or instructed her son to dispose of the murder weapon and then drove him from the scene of the crime.
	
	
	The fact is that Ms Michele Moore is Mr James Moore’s mother. They no doubt had a strained relationship. But it was to her that he turned when needing help and advice. Rather than counselling him to stay away from the dispute, she encouraged, and materially assisted him, to go to the scene and engage in an altercation with Mr Burns, knowing that her son was armed with a weapon capable of inflicting serious physical injury. She then helped him to try and cover up what occurred by disposing of the murder weapon and driving him from the scene of the crime.
	
	
	On any view, this was extensive encouragement and assistance given by Ms Michele Moore to her son. I regard the objective criminality of her participation in this offence as an aider and abetter as falling at the upper end of the mid‑range of seriousness of objective criminality.
	
	
	Mr Price took a lesser role in what was occurring. He was not directly related to Mr James Moore except by his marriage to Ms Michele Moore. He certainly went along in the motor vehicle. The weapon with which he was armed was unlikely, of itself, to cause any serious physical injury. Although I am satisfied that it must have been obvious to Mr Price, at the time they arrived at the scene of the confrontation, that Mr James Moore intended to inflict really serious physical injury on Mr Burns from the fact that he carried the mattock handle from the car and confronted Mr Burns, I am not satisfied that Mr Price played nearly as significant a role as his wife did by way of encouraging or assisting Mr James Moore. There is no evidence that he said anything to Mr James Moore to encourage him. No doubt, his close presence whilst armed with a fishing rod, and his use of the fishing rod on at least four separate occasions to hit Mr Burns, encouraged Mr James Moore to keep going with his assault.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that Mr Price, other than by disposing of his own implement, the fishing rod, and his hat, did anything to assist Mr James Moore after the event with the disposal of his weapon and other material.
	
	
	In my assessment, the criminality of Mr Price is lower than that of Ms Michele Moore, and is at the lower end of the mid-range of seriousness of objective criminality.
	


Subjective Circumstances of the Offender, Ms Michele Moore


	
	Ms Michele Moore is now 51 years old. She was 49 when the deceased died.
	
	
	She was educated to the age of 16, and then left school to work. She moved with her parents from Sydney to Coffs Harbour many years ago. She has two sisters. Her mother is alive. A brother has died. There is no evidence of anything exceptional in her upbringing.
	
	
	She married at a relatively young age, and has two children. As well as her son, she has a daughter. She has been married on a number of occasions, most recently to Mr Price.
	
	
	In 1991 she was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident. The physical consequences meant that she has been largely unable to work since them.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that as an adult she has had any drug or alcohol issues, nor that she has suffered, or now suffers, from any diagnosable mental health condition.
	


Subjective Circumstances of the Offender, Mr Price


	
	Mr Price will shortly turn 44 years old. He was 41 at the time of the events for which he has been convicted.
	
	
	He was born in country New South Wales. He is the youngest of five children. He has three elder brothers and one elder sister. His parents separated when he was very young. He was educated to school certificate level and left when he was 16.
	
	
	He has lived in Coffs Harbour for many years, and has generally been employed throughout that period. He has been a heavy drinker over time and has been recently diagnosed as having a Substance Use Disorder. Although he may have had episodes of depression in the past, his present condition does not warrant a psychiatric diagnosis of depression. There is no evidence of any personality disorder.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	I am satisfied, having regard to the nature of the offence, the likely prospects of rehabilitation, and the fact that each of the offenders are unlikely to commit further offences, that it is appropriate that I should make a finding of special circumstances in each case as the law permits [18] , and as was submitted by each of their counsel.
	
	
	In my view, each offender will be much assisted to reintegrate into the community by a longer than usual non-parole period to ensure that they do not relapse from the promise, of which I am persuaded, of their likely good prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Sentence


	
	In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on each of Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price, the commencement point is the nature of the offence with which they have been convicted. Murder involves the criminal taking of a human life. Whatever one might think, and I express no view about this, of Mr Burns and his lifestyle, he was entitled to continue living his life as he saw fit. Murder is a violation of the sanctity of human life which, in my assessment, is at the heart of a civilised community.
	
	
	Murder necessarily, as one of the most serious crimes which is proscribed by law, warrants a substantial sentence. People who engage in this offence must be punished. The public must be deterred from engaging in conduct which involves the unlawful taking of human life. The community would be offended by an overly lenient sentence imposed by the Courts on an offender guilty of murder. But, it is also necessary that I keep in mind that neither of these two offenders delivered the blow which took the life of Mr Burns. They merely encouraged or assisted that conduct on the part of Mr James Moore.
	
	
	The conflict between Mr James Moore and Mr Burns was minor. It was transient. It required the exercise of mature judgment. What was called for in these circumstances was not to take Mr James Moore to the scene whilst he, Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price were armed but, rather, to stay well away from the scene and to enable time to pass and tempers to cool.
	
	
	In Ms Moore’s case I have had regard to all of the subjective background which I have described above. I have had regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which I am obliged to consider. She was not young and immature like her son, Mr James Moore, was. She was the one person who could, by her mature conduct, have discouraged Mr James Moore from engaging in this violent assault. On the contrary, she encouraged and assisted him in his conduct. Then she went to some lengths, including lying to the police, to cover up the true extent of the crime, and particularly, her involvement in it.
	
	
	I determine the appropriate overall sentence to be one of 22 years imprisonment. Of that sentence, I determine that Ms Michele Moore must spend 15 years in jail before being eligible for parole.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Price, I am satisfied that his conduct reflected misplaced loyalty to Ms Michele Moore and lack of judgment on his part. Nevertheless, he knew what was likely to happen when he arrived at the scene. He went along with it and he participated in it. Then he tried to cover up his involvement. I have taken into account the subjective factors relevant to Mr Price and, in particular, his previous good character. I determine that an appropriate overall sentence for Mr Price is 18 years imprisonment. Of that sentence, I determine that Mr Price must spend 12 years in jail before being eligible for parole.
	


Commencement Date


	
	The sentences should commence on the day that each of Ms Moore and Mr Price were arrested and taken into custody, namely 22 November 2012.
	


Offence of Serious Personal Violence


	
	I am required to warn each of Ms Michele Moore and Mr Price, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which each of them has been convicted, and for which each of them is about to be formally sentenced.
	
	
	At some future point in time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of their sentence, they nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody, or else be the subject of an extended supervision order impacting upon their liberty.
	


Sentence


	
	Ms Michele Kathleen Moore, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:
	



	
	A non-parole period of 15 years commencing on 22 November 2012, and concluding on 21 November 2027;
	
	
	A balance of term of 7 years commencing on 22 November 2027 and concluding on 21 November 2034;
	
	
	You will not be eligible to be released before the expiry of your non‑parole period.
	



	
	Mr Brendan James Price, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:
	



	
	A non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 22 November 2012, and concluding on 21 November 2024;
	
	
	A balance of term of 6 years commencing on 22 November 2024 and concluding on 21 November 2030;
	
	
	You will not be eligible to be released before the expiry of your non‑parole period.

2702950,Standen v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 211,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Mark William Standen, was the Assistant Director, Investigations of the New South Wales Crime Commission (NSWCC). For a number of years prior to his arrest, he was involved in investigating drug trafficking and money laundering. Bakhos Jalalaty (Jalalaty) was an importer/exporter of foods. James Henry Kinch (Kinch) was a British citizen who had been arrested in Australia in 2003 for drug trafficking and money laundering offences. Kinch provided assistance to the NSWCC as an informer and the appellant was Kinch’s handler at the NSWCC.

In the Supreme Court, a jury found the appellant guilty of:

Conspiring with Jalalaty, Kinch and members of a Dutch criminal syndicate to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use the pseudoephedrine to manufacture a controlled drug, contrary to ss 307.11(1) and 11.5 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth);

Knowingly taking part in the supply of 300kgs of pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW);

Conspiring with Jalalaty and Kinch to pervert the course of justice by agreeing that the appellant would use the knowledge and information obtained by him in his role with the NSWCC to avoid proceedings being instituted, or successfully prosecuted, with respect to the importation offence, contrary to s 42 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

The appellant was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years on the first count, 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years on the second count, 3 years 6 months imprisonment on the third count.

The Crown case was that Kinch’s role in the conspiracy was to liaise with the Dutch syndicate and provide funding for the operation. Jalalaty’s role was to deal with third parties to order and receive consignments from overseas and to store the pseudoephedrine. The appellant’s role was to use his law enforcement expertise and senior position to help Jalalaty and Kinch avoid detection and prosecution, to monitor Jalalaty and assist him and instruct him on what to say to investigators if questioned.

The evidence at trial revealed, inter alia, a large amount of communication between the parties during the relevant period, the appellant’s receipt of gifts and payments from Kinch, the appellant’s failure to report contact with Kinch to the NSWCC and the appellant’s knowledge that acetone would be stored at Jalalaty’s warehouse until it could be used. This occurred at a time when the appellant was in a strained financial position, had borrowed money from an associate and had failed to report this to the NSWCC. The evidence also revealed meetings between Jalalaty and Kinch in Bangkok and Jalalaty’s receipt of money from an associate of Kinch.

The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence on the second count on the following grounds:

The trial judge erred in admitting:

NSWCC documents and testimony regarding these documents;

Evidence relating to the possession of acetone by Jalalaty;

Evidence relating to ‘MDMA’;

Evidence of ‘lies’ by the appellant.

There was a miscarriage of justice arising from the failure of the jury to be directed that a finding of guilt on Count 1 could only be made if the jury were satisfied that, during the currency of the conspiracy, the appellant and one other conspirator actually believed, at the same time, that another person intended to use the substance to manufacture a controlled drug.

The trial judge erred in failing to dismiss the jury on the 68th day of the trial, following a note setting out their concerns as to the length of the trial.

The trial judge’s summing-up was unbalanced and led to a miscarriage of justice.

The sentence imposed for Count 2 was manifestly excessive.

The Court (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL, McCallum J) held, dismissing the appeal:

Ground 1: Errors in admitting certain evidence

In order for evidence to be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, unfair prejudice to the accused must be identified, evidence is not prejudicial merely because it tends to establish the Crown case: [333].

Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297, R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131, Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593, applied

There was no error in admitting the NSWCC evidence as it was relevant and highly probative, demonstrating the impropriety of the appellant’s relationship with Kinch and his motive for engaging in the conspiracy: [331], [335].

Wilson v R [1970] HCA 32; 123 CLR 334, Harriman v The Queen [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590, R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82, applied

Patel v R [2012] HCA 29; 247 CLR 531, distinguished

There was no error in admitting the evidence relating to acetone as it supported the inference that what was intended to be imported was a substance that could be used to manufacture a prohibited drug and that the appellant, Kinch and Jalalaty were involved: [361].

There was no error in admitting the evidence relating to MDMA as this evidence was relevant to the appellant’s involvement in the conspiracy and to Count 3 and was not unfairly prejudicial: [374]-[376].

There was no error in admitting evidence that the appellant did not tell RAMS about his loan and requested his associate not to tell the NSWCC, as this evidence was relevant to the appellant’s financial position and was evidence from which the jury could infer a corrupt relationship with Kinch: [386].

Ground 3: Failure to direct the jury as to the elements of a conspiracy

For the crime of conspiracy under ss 307.11(1) and 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth) to be made out, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove the precise date at which the accused and one other party entered into the agreement. It is necessary, however, for the Crown to prove that the accused and one other party participated in an agreement to commit the offence prescribed by s 307.11 in the period the subject of the indictment. The accused and that party must believe that another party intended to use the substance to manufacture a controlled drug and must hold the belief required by s 307.11(1)(b)(i) during the course of the conspiracy and at the same time. The trial judge’s directions adequately dealt with this matter: [417], [419], [422]-[425].

The Queen v LK; The Queen v RK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177, Agius v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; 248 CLR 601, Standen v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWCCA 187; 254 FLR 467, applied.

Ground 4: Failure to dismiss the jury on the 68th day of the trial

The trial judge did not err in failing to dismiss the jury on the 68th day of the trial as the trial judge did not know that the trial would last more than 3 months, the power to empanel additional jurors was not enlivened, the jury’s concerns did not point to any incapacity to discharge their functions as jurors and the trial judge was best placed to assess the fairness of continuing the trial: [435], [437]-[438].

Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427, applied.

Cesan v DPP (Cth); Mas Rivadavia v DPP (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 273, distinguished.

Ground 5: The summing-up was unbalanced

The trial judge’s summing-up was not unbalanced or unfair as the trial judge properly informed the jury that they were the judges of fact, that they should disregard his comments on facts if they did not agree with them and that any comments he made on the Crown’s or appellant’s submissions should not be taken as an endorsement of them: [450]-[451], [459].

Abdel-Hady (“SA”) v R [2011] NSWCCA 196, R v Courtney-Smith (1990) 48 A Crim R 49, R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91, applied.

The Sentencing Appeal

When sentencing, an appropriate sentence must be formulated in respect of each offence. It is only when that has occurred that considerations of cumulation, concurrence and totality are taken into account to ensure that the overall sentence is within an appropriate range. Thus, it would be incorrect for the Court to take the sentence for the conspiracy to import offence and use it as a benchmark against which to measure the sentences for the other offences as that approach would have no regard to the maximum sentence: [511], [512], [515], [516].

Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270, applied.

The sentence imposed for Count 2 was not manifestly excessive, unreasonable or plainly unjust given the maximum sentence for that offence, the trial judge’s assessment that the offence was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of its type, the fact that the elements and facts which went to make up the conspiracy to import offence and the supply offence were different and the fact that the trial judge specifically dealt with the actions of the appellant which were directly referable to supply: [501], [513].

R v Campbell [2008] NSWCCA 214; 73 NSWLR 272, Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, considered.

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: By an indictment presented on 16 November 2010, the appellant, Mark William Standen (the appellant), was charged with the following offences:
	


“1.   between 1 January 2006 and 2 June 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Bakhos Jalalaty, James Henry Kinch and divers others to import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity.

Contrary to Sections 307.11(1) and 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Law Part Codes: 58481, 41450).

2.   between 1 January 2006 and 2 June 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did knowingly take part in the supply of an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit 300kgs of pseudoephedrine, being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.

Contrary to Section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (Law Part Code: 68401).

3.   between 1 January 2006 and 2 June 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with Bakhos Jalalaty and James Henry Kinch to pervert the course of justice in relation to the judicial power of the Commonwealth, by agreeing that Mark Standen would use his knowledge and information obtained by him in order to avoid proceedings being instituted or successfully prosecuted with respect to an offence of importing a substance in contravention of Commonwealth law.

(Contrary to Section 42 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (Law Part Code: 10877).”


	
	After a lengthy trial before James J and a jury, the appellant was convicted on all counts. On Count 1, he was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 2 June 2008. On Count 2, he was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period 16 years, commencing on 2 June 2008. On Count 3, he was sentenced to 3 years 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 2 June 2008.
	
	
	The appellant has appealed against his conviction on all counts and has sought leave to appeal against his sentence on Count 2.
	


The Crown case


	
	In its broadest outline, the Crown case can be summarised as follows. During the period covered by the indictment, the appellant was the Assistant Director, Investigations of the New South Wales Crime Commission (NSWCC). The only persons senior to him in the NSWCC were the Commissioner and the Director. He had a long history of working for law enforcement and investigative bodies, including the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Crime Commission. He joined the NSWCC in 1996. For a number of years prior to his arrest, the appellant headed up one of two investigation teams at the NSWCC which investigated drug trafficking and money laundering.
	
	
	The appellant’s alleged co-conspirator, Bakhos Jalalaty (Jalalaty), conducted an import/export food business. His wife (Ms Jalalaty) had worked with the appellant in the AFP and the appellant had met Jalalaty through her. The other named alleged co-conspirator, James Henry Kinch (Kinch), was a British citizen arrested in Australia in 2003 for drug trafficking and money laundering offences. After his arrest, Kinch commenced providing assistance to the NSWCC. The appellant and a NSW police officer, who was much junior to him, became the co-handlers of Kinch as an informer. The appellant introduced Kinch to Jalalaty. Kinch was not in Australia at any time during the period that the conspiracy was said to be on foot.
	
	
	The Crown case concerned a conspiracy to import a large quantity of pseudoephedrine, in the order of 300 kgs, contained in shipments of rice, with the amount of money which could be derived from the importation at times referred to as $100,000 per kilogram. It should be noted that when the shipment of rice which was allegedly intended to contain the pseudoephedrine arrived in Australia, it did not contain any bags of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	Participants in the conspiracy were said to include the appellant, Jalalaty, Kinch and members of a criminal syndicate based in the Netherlands. It was alleged that Kinch had close connections with the syndicate, which was based around a Mr Ronald Haklander (Mr Haklander) (referred to as ‘Fat Ron’) (the Haklander syndicate). The syndicate had connections with persons in Pakistan who were believed to be able to secure large quantities of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that the appellant formed a corrupt relationship with Kinch between the time of his arrest in 2003 and the commencement of the conspiracy. The admission of the evidence concerning this relationship is the subject of Ground 1 of the grounds of appeal. The Crown case was that during this time, the appellant commenced receiving corrupt payments from Kinch and the appellant regularly failed to report and document contact that he had with Kinch.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant was in a strained financial situation throughout the relevant period. He had incurred large credit card debts and had over-extended his finances by purchasing a property at Bateau Bay. The Crown case was that it could be inferred from this that he was expecting a financial windfall. This was allegedly consistent with communications between the appellant and Jalalaty about anticipated profits from the activities the subject of the charges.
	
	
	The Crown case was that between 19 and 22 January 2006, Jalalaty met Kinch in Bangkok. Shortly thereafter, Jalalaty received approximately $1 million in cash from an associate of Kinch (referred to as the “Portuguese mate”), which was to be used to build-up Jalalaty’s business as a legitimate front for the illegal activities. The Crown case was that the appellant was aware of this payment. It was also the Crown case that the appellant was aware that before Kinch left Australia in 2004, he had access to over $1.5 million cash, the proceeds of drug dealing or related crime.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that a substantial portion of these funds were invested by Jalalaty with a Mr Bruce Way (Mr Way), without the agreement of Kinch. The Crown case was that the appellant used his position and contacts to assist in attempting to recover that amount.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the principal role played by Kinch in the conspiracy was to liaise with the Haklander syndicate. He was also to provide funding for the Australian limb of the operation. Jalalaty’s role was to deal directly with the syndicate members and their Pakistan associates in relation to the ordering and receiving of consignments shipped from overseas. He was also responsible for storing the pseudoephedrine contained in the shipment of rice. The Crown alleged that the pseudoephedrine was to be obtained from Jalalaty and then manufactured into a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant had two major roles. The first was to use his law enforcement expertise and senior position to help his co-conspirators avoid detection. Second, on Jalalaty’s shortcomings becoming increasingly obvious, the appellant was instructed by Kinch to monitor Jalalaty and assist him in carrying out his role. At the request of Kinch, he also instructed Jalalaty on what to say to investigators in the event that he (Jalalaty) was questioned (the insurance policy).
	


The evidence at the trial

A The intercepted and surveillance material


	
	The Crown placed considerable reliance on communications between the named alleged conspirators and others said to have been involved in the conspiracy. A large amount of lawfully intercepted material was tendered at the hearing. Although it is not necessary to record all of that material, to understand the case it is necessary to refer to some important aspects. This summary of the intercepted and surveillance material, as well as the summaries of the appellant’s and Jalalaty’s ERISPs, the documents obtained as a result of search warrants and the evidence of witnesses at trial, is largely drawn from the Part 1A Document provided by the Crown in the appeal. It was not contended by the appellant that the summary, at least to the extent that it is reproduced below, was incorrect.
	
	
	The evidence relating to the intercepted material was led through Federal Agent Watt (Agent Watt). In his evidence, he explained the technique of covert email communications dominantly used by the conspirators. He explained that most of the email accounts held by the conspirators were not used to send emails. Rather, the login information for the accounts would be shared between the conspirators, who would then leave messages for each other in the form of saved draft emails. Draft emails would then typically be deleted or overwritten after being read. This enabled the conpirators to communicate without ever having to send emails or leave an email exchange. Agent Watt explained that while some of the conspirators’ emails were lawfully intercepted through telephone intercepts, others were intercepted by means of a device covertly installed on the appellant’s and Jalalaty’s computers, which took screenshots every ten seconds. The unsent draft email messages were captured in this way.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that the AFP began investigating Jalalaty when he was sent a facsimile on 14 May 2007. The fax was from a fictitious company, MDL Food & Services India (MDL Food), which was understood to be a front for a Dutch drug syndicate already under joint investigation by Australian and Dutch authorities. It was sent from an internet café in Amsterdam which was used by the Haklander syndicate because it did not add a time or location stamp to outgoing faxes. The fax was purportly sent from Delhi India to introduce MDL Food as a “manufacturer and supplier of … food and beverages … all over India and Middle East”. It stated that MDL Food “would like to start business and co-operation with your company BJS Fine Foods in Australia”. The facsimile invited Jalalaty to visit MDL factories in Delhi and noted that MDL’s branch office was in the United Arab Emirates.
	
	
	Kinch was known to the AFP by the time of the commencement of the investigation. On 24 May 2007, Dutch investigators photographed two known close associates of Kinch, Mr Haklander and a Mr Petrus Dekker (Mr Dekker), with Kinch in Amsterdam. On 29 June 2007, Kinch was also photographed with Mr Haklander, Mr Dekker, a Mr Leok Weerden (aka Rashid) and a Mr Tom Van Den Berg (Mr Van Den Berg) in Amsterdam.
	
	
	Six email exchanges between the conspirators which pre-dated the investigation, during the period from 3 May 2006 to 18 May 2007, were recovered from the email account provider after the investigation commenced. They showed that: Jalalaty provided the appellant his bank account details “for the investment”; the appellant passed on news from Kinch to Jalalaty, including Kinch’s instruction that the appellant and Jalalaty should take $76,000 out of “existing funds if there is enough left” and split this amount; and Jalalaty asked the appellant what Kinch wanted him to do with “the drums”. They also referred to Jalalaty’s travels in Asia meeting “powerful and influential people” and various deals involving the appellant and Jalalaty, and in some cases implicitly Kinch, such as an order of “two containers of water” for $80,000, from which they would “make 20,000 dollars profit”. The emails also refer to an anticipated trip to Dubai in January or February 2007.
	


May 2007


	
	In May 2007, Jalalaty was recorded discussing with the appellant: food imports arranged with his business partner, Julian Holmes, in Dubai, which he intended to sell to “IGA” and “Harris Farm”; tracking down the whereabouts and assets of Mr Way (whom the appellant and Jalalaty held responsible for losing or stealing their $580,000 investment) with the assistance of the appellant, Roger Rogerson and Mr Frank Wheeler (Mr Wheeler); and Jalalaty’s debt owed to a friend.
	


June 2007


	
	Rashid and Mr Van Den Berg were recorded by Dutch police on 1 June 2007 discussing that “the faxes had been sent” and “the other would first like to have a … test sending”. It could be inferred that this related to the facsimile of 14 May 2007, referred to in par [16] above.
	
	
	Telephone intercepts in that month also record continued attempts to trace the lost investment with Mr Way, with the assistance of the appellant and Mr Wheeler. In those communications, the appellant was recorded as saying that Mr Wheeler often referred matters to him at the NSWCC if it appeared that there had been a fraud that the appellant would want to investigate. The intercepts also showed that the appellant made checks at the NSWCC (using the AUSTRAC database) and confirmed to Jalalaty that money given to Mr Way had been transferred out of the country. On 15 June 2007, Mr Wheeler brought Mr Way to the NSWCC premises to meet with the appellant. The appellant told Jalalaty that Mr Way gave him the details of the people with whom he had invested the money and that recovery of the money from Mr Way himself was “hopeless”.
	
	
	Around this time, members of the Haklander syndicate arranged a shipment of two boxes of sample food products from Dubai, purporting to be from MDL Food, to BJ’s Fine Foods. A fax purporting to be from MDL Food sent from the Amsterdam internet café was received at Jalalaty’s home on 19 June 2007. The fax referred to the consignment and MDL’s ability to ship goods in large shipping containers and advised that MDL’s representative in Dubai, Daniel Cloutier (Mr Cloutier), would be in contact with Jalalaty to finalise documents. Agent Watt gave evidence that Mr Cloutier was an alias for the Haklander syndicate member, Jan Plas (Mr Plas).
	
	
	On 16 June, Jalalaty arranged for $145,000 to be sent to Kinch to provide a partial refund for the money which Kinch had advanced to him. The following day, Jalalaty arranged to meet an unknown male connected to Kinch (the Portuguese mate). He called his wife at the time and told her that he needed a further $360,000 to get Kinch “off his back”. On the same day, he called the appellant and told him that he had to pay Kinch $500,000 and that he was trying to “scrounge” together everything he could to meet his debts.
	
	
	On the same day, Jalalaty was surveilled going into the Bondi Junction Westfield shopping centre and exiting an hour later with an unknown man who was alleged by the Crown to be the Portuguese mate. Jalalaty showed the man a box and its contents in the boot of his car. Agent Watt said that the box resembled one of the several boxes sent by the Haklander syndicate, which had been inspected by authorities before being sent on to Jalalaty.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that on 20 June 2007, Mr Cloutier/Mr Plas called Jalalaty from Dubai, saying that he had information that the samples had been received and confirmed this with Jalalaty. The intercepted conversation showed that Jalalaty asked if coconut could be shipped in 25 pound bags and advised that coconut milk required a nutritional information panel to get through Customs. On 22 June, Jalalaty viewed a draft email message drafted by Kinch which said, “have any news on the salts … that is very important … as i am under pressure to make a decision if i want liquids or powdered products its more work but personaly i prefer the milk what are your thoughts”. Jalalaty responded in a draft email the same day saying “It doesn’t matter which products you send … I only told you that I had a market for the Coconut Milk and for the shredded coconut as they are big sellers. The salts can be sold but in smaller volumes”.
	
	
	Later that day, Jalalaty rang the appellant and told him that he had emails overnight and had sent another email to the appellant. On the following day, Jalalaty read another draft email message from Kinch in which Kinch assured Jalalaty that he would have his first delivery in a matter of weeks and said that he wanted to “push the c/milk as the main line”.
	
	
	In the meantime, on 25 June 2007, Mr Way emailed Mr Wheeler referring to an agreement made at the meeting with “Mr Stanton, Assistant Commissioner of the NSW Crimes Commission … held across the road [from the Commission] in a coffee shop”. The email also referred to Mr Wheeler’s insistence that Mr Way personally reimburse the Jalalatys. On 25 June, this email was forwarded by Mr Wheeler to the appellant and the appellant and Jalalaty discussed it later that day. In the discussion, Jalalaty wanted confirmation that what Mr Wheeler was doing was legal.
	
	
	On 26 June 2007, a Haklander syndicate member, Rashid, pretending to be from Dubai, called Jalalaty to let him know that he was trying to send faxes through to him (Jalalaty). A fax dated 25 June 2007, purporting to be from MDL Food, was then sent from a Dubai coffee shop and received by Jalalaty. It referred to a shipment of coconut milk and powder and further samples of goods which would be ready for shipment in two to three weeks. The fax referred to Mr Cloutier as their representative.
	
	
	On 28 June 2007, Jalalaty received instructions by telephone from an unknown woman to transfer $5,000 into the appellant’s bank account.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 29 June 2007, Kinch was observed meeting Rashid, Mr Van Den Berg, Mr Haklander and Mr Dekker in Amsterdam.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that throughout June, the appellant and Jalalaty agreed to meet in person on at least nine different occasions and they were observed meeting near the NSWCC on 13 and 19 June 2007.
	


July 2007


	
	The appellant, Jalalaty and Kinch remained in email contact throughout this month.
	
	
	On 1 July 2007, Kinch told Jalalaty that he had met a sales manager who was “happy to go on”, but warned Jalalaty not to mention “in any way, shape or form anything to do with your ex mrs job or maurice’’s business as this would finish the whole thing”. The reference to “your ex mrs” was said to be to Ms Jalalaty, who had previously been an AFP officer, while “maurice” referred to the appellant.
	
	
	In early July 2007, Jalalaty told the appellant that he had some receipts of money transfers to the appellant.
	


August 2007


	
	There were frequent communications between Kinch and Jalalaty in August 2007, using a number of different aliases and discussing various products and investment opportunities which Kinch had investigated and passed on to Jalalaty. On 6 August 2007, Jalalaty emailed Kinch, “I am seeing my girlfriend today as I miss her and havent seen her for a while. Her parents are very strict so we have to be very sneaky about seeing each other”. The following day, the appellant and Jalalaty spoke on the phone and agreed to meet that afternoon for the first time since July.
	
	
	On 15 August 2007, the appellant called Mr Wheeler and advised him not to send a letter to the directors of the company in which Jalalaty’s money had been invested, which purported to summon them to a hearing before the appellant at the NSWCC, because that was not how it worked.
	
	
	On 16 August 2007, Kinch asked Jalalaty to give the appellant some receipts to “give to Jojo”, which was an alias for Kinch. Later that day, Kinch complained to the appellant that he (Kinch) had told Jalalaty that the appellant could have (within reason) whatever he needed and did not understand why the appellant had to get him (Kinch) to tell Jalalaty and why they had to explain everything to Jalalaty.
	
	
	On 17 August, a conversation between the appellant and Jalalaty was recorded in Jalalaty’s car. They discussed possible jam importation and the sugar content of jam.
	
	
	Around 25 August, Jalalaty was recorded checking various bank account balances and had approximately $451,530 in one account and $240,090 in another. The appellant was also recorded accessing his online banking service, which showed debts of $86,932.23 and $26,150.47. He was recorded making a payment of $5,000 to “AW & GA Newton” on 21 August 2007. Anthony Newton (Mr Newton) was subordinate to the appellant at the NSWCC and gave evidence at the trial that he had mortgaged his house to lend the appellant $200,000.
	
	
	On 28 August 2007, Dutch surveillance observed Kinch meeting with Rashid, Mr Haklander and Mr Dekker in Amsterdam. On 29 August, Jalalaty read a message from Kinch which said “I had a meeting with the sales manager today, he explained about the new rules concerning import licences etc, anyway all is in order and they will send you mail tomorrow and the products will be with you soon”. Jalalaty responded with an acknowledgement signed “Bruce sales and Marketing Manager”.
	


September 2007


	
	On 5 September 2007, Jalalaty received a fax dated 30 August 2007 addressed to BJ’s Fine Foods, purporting to be from “Elegant Hosiery (Pvt.) Ltd” in Lahore, Pakistan. It advised him that Elegant Hosiery had been nominated by MDL Food to supply the export of “Pakistani Basmati Rise” to Australia. It also said that the three to four week delay was caused by Australian Customs checking the “company, factory, goods and container” at the point of departure and advised that all necessary documents would be forwarded to Jalalaty in time for collection.
	
	
	On 6 September 2007, Jalalaty advised Kinch that he had received nine pages of documentation regarding the first shipment. The same day, Kinch emailed the appellant about “a bit of gossip” that “ron bullit and dirk are both in the hospital in Belgium,, arms and money problems”. He also appeared to pass on new email account details. The next communication between Kinch and the appellant, according to Agent Watt, was saved to this new email account.
	
	
	On 9 September 2007, Jalalaty received a fax from Elegant Hosiery setting out “the final details of the shipment”. On 10 September 2007, Jalalaty told the appellant that he had ordered a container of rice, had the bill of lading and that “all my documentation and eh my warehouse is good it’s all clean and the pallets are all there ready to unload”.
	
	
	The appellant and Jalalaty met on 15 September 2007 at a café in Wahroonga. Their conversation was recorded by a listening device. In the course of that conversation, Jalalaty said to the appellant, “how long would it take for someone to say what the fuck’n what’s Elegant Hosiery doing selling rice is that silly”. The appellant replied, “all sorts of companies do all sorts of stuff”. Jalalaty then complained that the price for the rice was above market price, but he did not pay anything “that makes it uh $6 a bag”. Jalalaty went on to say that “I’ve got everything they never sent me a sample of rice but you don’t need to and and Pakistani rice is known as the best rice in the world that’s not a problem but the price is not right but it’s close to it all documentation is all spot on and it’s already been checked by AQIS [Australian Quarantine & Inspection Service] Australian AQIS over there”. Jalalaty said that there was 17 tonnes of rice. He said that he did not order it but that it could be sold. The appellant asked where it was and Jalalaty replied, “it arrives here on the 10th of October”. The appellant said, “you don’t even know what it is you don’t know if it’s rice or it’s not rice” and Jalalaty responded, “no it’s already been checked by Australian customs”. The appellant said that Jalalaty should keep it at his (Jalalaty’s) warehouse.
	
	
	Later in the conversation, the appellant asked “so you’re thinking this is just rice” and Jalalaty replied, “I don’t know I think it is because he is just testing the water”. The appellant also said that once it arrives, “you just don’t know what you’ve got either” and Jalalaty replied, “now that I know it’s coming I’ve already spoken to enough people as soon as it arrives hey listen your rice is here”. There was then a discussion about customs in Australia, Jalalaty saying, “what they’re worried about they’re not worried about drugs they’re worried … about things getting in like with rice little weevils”. The appellant told Jalalaty that Customs still examine incoming goods and Jalalaty asked what Customs looked for. The appellant replied, “Customs look for wrongly described goods um undervalued goods umm prohibited goods of any sort including drugs like anything prohibited wrong description of goods”. A conversation to the following effect then occurred:
	


“Jalalaty: well when it arrives it’s all be the same it could be anywhere I don’t think it’s in the first container cause he said to me let me know if there’s any let me know if there’s any …

Appellant: but you haven’t had to actually pay for that rice they are not expecting you to pay for it … we haven’t really … but on paper it looks like it is already paid for … so you say yeah I had the money sent to me from Dubai … they’d look for the money leaving here wouldn’t they and there’s no evidence of the money leaving here.

…

Jalalaty: I know for sure I can sell them for five dollars a kilo

Appellant: so you pick up seventeen thousand bucks for nothing … even if there’s nothing in it.

…

Jalalaty: (indistinct) came in couldn’t have been checked down the other end otherwise they would have picked it up

Appellant: wouldn’t matter under the new system they wouldn’t make it

Jalalaty: that’s why I don’t think the first container will be anything I think it’s just rice

Appellant: yeah unless they have a way of getting to it after it’s been quarantined

…

Appellant: mm I just can’t wait for the bloody get the slate clean … I’ll get the slate clean just get and then get just a little bit ahead of the action … slate clean’s the most important thing

Jalalaty: well that should be this one

Appellant: and then get a little bit ahead of the action so I’m not chasing the eight ball all the time.”


	
	Subsequently, the appellant made the following remarks:
	


“I did a job once a couple of years ago where all this stuff came in through the big the plastic orange drums … an olive importer out near the airport and … he had a warehouse full … all the drums were the same colour but … when you put them together you go oh yeah oh yeah didn’t notice that … and they were all these drums lying on his warehouse floor they said that one that one that one that one that one that one that one couple of Islanders right load all those up yep thank you the rest are yours.”


	
	The appellant told Jalalaty that the olive importer got away with it because he said that he did not know anything and co-operated with the police. Jalalaty said that that was what he would do. The appellant responded, “the only thing you’ve got to have clear in your head is how it started how did you first get in touch with these people”. The appellant then set out a detailed account of how Jalalaty could say he came to know the exporters and that if anything was found, he should say, “they shouldn’t have sent” it and “I’ll help ya hang the bastards”.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that in 2002, the appellant was involved in the NSWCC investigation of the olive importer with the orange drums.
	
	
	Jalalaty and the appellant then discussed their financial difficulties. In the course of that conversation, the appellant made the following remarks:
	


“they just gotta send me money they could put the money in through the businesses and just send me the money and the thing is they bought me out of the house they bought my share the share of the house is worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars.”

“I just want two hundred thousand”

And subsequently:

“Yeah two thousand a weeks ok we’ll do that its easy look a piece of cake but I need about a two grand a month buffer.”

And later in the conversation:

“I took out a bigger ah I’ve created this bigger mortgage I’ve had umm I’ve had to get the deposit off that (indistinct) cash advance on credit cards I’ve done all those things that’s the trouble once you do that so like I’ve got I’ve got like I’m running four credit cards at their maximum I’m just doing this I’m paying off use it paying off use it that’s how I’m keeping my head above water by doing this yeah

Subsequently, the following exchange occurred:

“Appellant: depends what they buy and what they sell it for they’d probably make … at least umm allowing to pay for all costs they’d probably make from a hundred to a hundred and twenty a kilo.

Jalalaty: so if they bring in a hundred kilos it makes twelve million profit and he goes half with (indistinct) biggest mule and we go we go thirds that is that’s what he said to me the first job (indistinct) make one each.”

The evidence established that pseudoephedrine had an estimated wholesale value of $40,000 per kilogram.


	
	Later in the conversation, Mr Jalalaty asked about using internet cafés and the appellant replied:
	


“Yeah we’ve followed people into internet cafés if they’re doing really dodgy stuff and when they’re gone we go and take the we go and approach the owner and we’d take the we take the box from the internet café download it.”

Mr Jalalaty is recorded as laughing and the appellant went on to say “because if you delete stuff it’s still there but if you type over the top of it you know”.


	
	On 17 September, Jalalaty confirmed some of the shipping details with Kinch via email and asked if it all sounded right to him. Later that day, Rashid called Jalalaty to ask if the second shipment could be sent. Jalalaty said yes and asked if it was rice and Rashid said that yes, the second would be just rice, but the third and fourth might have different goods, as agreed. Jalalaty said that he would have to discount the rice to sell it and Rashid said, “this is the special rice you know what … with the vegetables and everything in it”.
	
	
	On 23 September 2007, the appellant asked Jalalaty for $9,000 to cover some of his expenses. The amount of $9,000 was deposited by cheque into the appellant’s account on 27 September 2007.
	
	
	From about this time on, there were a series of conversations between Jalalaty and persons from Pakistan and between Jalalaty and Kinch concerning difficulties in getting the bill of lading in respect of the rice shipment. It is unnecessary to set out those conversations in detail.
	
	
	On 27 September 2007, Ms Jalalaty told Jalalaty that she had received a fax from Pakistan requesting US $6,231 immediately. On the same day, Jalalaty told her that the $9,000 for the appellant “comes off the purchase price of the rice”. Jalalaty also received a further fax purporting to be from Elegant Hosiery confirming the first shipment and forecasting shipping dates for the second, to contain “Pakistani Basmati Rise”.
	
	
	On 28 September, Jalalaty told the appellant about the further request for money from Elegant Hosiery. The appellant told Jalalaty that the investment of $580,000 that Jalalaty had lost with Mr Way appeared to be a common form of scam and the appellant would contact his “FBI mate” to look into Jalalaty’s case.
	
	
	On the same day, Jalalaty made inquiries with the shipping company about the status of the first shipment and organising a Customs agent. On the following day, Ms Jalalaty transferred the Australian dollar equivalent of $6,300 to Elegant Hosiery in Pakistan.
	


October 2007


	
	In early October 2007, Kinch told Jalalaty to “check the seals on the container to see if they are correct” once the shipment arrived. Agent Watt gave evidence that if the seal number on the received container did not match the seal number according to the bill of lading, it would indicate that Customs or the Australian Quarantine & Inspection Service (AQIS) had broken the seal to examine the contents.
	
	
	On 3 October 2007, Rashid was told that his container had arrived in Sydney Harbour “so please arrange the document and send there”. The person speaking to Rashid told him that he still had the bill of lading and Rashid would have to pay $8,700 to get it.
	
	
	The first rice shipment arrived in Australia on 4 October 2007, but there was a significant problem with the money transferred to Elegant Hosiery. As a result, the bill of lading was not posted to Jalalaty at the time of shipment and the majority of communications with Kinch in October concerned Jalalaty’s attempt to take possession of the shipment. During October, Jalalaty received a number of faxes from Elegant Hosiery and MDL Food. He was also in frequent contact with “Raza from Pakistan” and “Rashid from Dubai”. After more than two weeks of back and forth between Raza and Jalalaty trying to settle the problem with the money transfer, Raza told Jalalaty on 15 October, “this is a problem from eh Netherland Netherland side”.
	
	
	On 17 October, Rashid told Jalalaty that the problems were caused by their “Commissioner” in Pakistan (apparently a reference to Elegant Hosiery). Rashid told Jalalaty to pay the amount asked for by Elegant Hosiery, less the amount he had already transferred directly to Elegant Hosiery. On 19 October 2007, Rashid confirmed to Jalalaty that the Elegant Hosiery contact was “Razak”, but that he had been keeping the money and they would not use him again.
	
	
	On 22 October 2007, Jalalaty received a call from Raza who told him to transfer a further US $58,000 to Elegant Hosiery. On 24 October, Ms Jalalaty transferred $30,587 to Razbeek of Global Bizz in Pakistan, pursuant to instructions in a fax from MDL Food of 20 October 2007.
	
	
	Kinch sought frequent email updates on the status of the shipment from Jalalaty.
	
	
	On 15 October, the appellant wrote Kinch a message stating that he was hearing stories in Australia about “poms and others who live in Spain and Portugal” (Agent Watt gave evidence that Kinch spoke with an English accent and had lived in Portugal) and a number of other persons “who do business here”. He said that people were “hearing things they shouldn’t” and wanted to know if Kinch could assist. Kinch replied that he would try to help and he gave the appellant detailed information on what he knew about the people that the appellant had named, but said that he did not move in those circles anymore. He warned the appellant that one of the men mentioned “has contacts in redfern plus feds”. A few days later, the appellant wrote to Kinch saying that he was “looking forward to a time when none of this matters and we can meet and talk like normal people, without strings attached and people monitoring every move”.
	
	
	On 22 October 2007, the appellant was observed meeting Jalalaty at a café near the NSWCC. Part of the conversation was recorded. The appellant complained about his dire financial situation and they seemed to discuss an offer that someone had made to Jalalaty to help transfer $3 million out of America and into Australia, on which he would receive a one third commission. The appellant suggested that it sounded like a “Nigerian scam”, too good to be true and Jalalaty should consult Mr Wheeler, who had met the person making the offer.
	
	
	When Kinch learned, on 24 October 2007, that the bill of lading had still not been provided, he wrote to Jalalaty saying, “I’m really tired of these children, i will be seeing there mom later and depending on what is said I will decide whether to bother with them”. The reference to “their mom” was presumably a reference to those controlling the Haklander syndicate.
	
	
	On 25 October 2007, a conversation between the appellant and Jalalaty in Jalalaty’s vehicle was recorded. Jalalaty told the appellant about all of the difficulties he had been having with the first shipment and the confusion between Rashid, “the factory” (Elegant Hosiery) and Kinch. The appellant said that he could speak to Kinch, but that Jalalaty told him that it was now “all good” and all he wanted to know was whether the container had “been tampered with”.
	
	
	On 30 October 2007, Jalalaty advised Kinch that the container had arrived and would be checked by “quarantine not Customs”.
	


November 2007


	
	The shipment was received on 7 November 2007, after being fumigated a second time. Jalalaty expressed concern to Rashid that the fumigation process involved every item being removed from the crate and Kinch emailed Jalalaty asking if any of the packets were opened during the inspection. Jalalaty reported back that the inspection was triggered by loose grains of rice not having been cleaned before the container was sealed. Kinch told him to go ahead and sell all of the contents of the container. Kinch said that he had spoken to “Rash mom” and would tell her about the “cleaning rota”.
	
	
	Jalalaty’s communications with Raza and Rashid continued throughout November concerning outstanding and missing payments relating to the second shipment, without resolution. On 4 November 2007, Kinch complained to the appellant about Jalalaty, describing him as “a complete walter mitty”. The appellant replied, apologising for “Mr Bean”, saying that he had “me fooled well and truly”. On 12 November 2007, Kinch asked the appellant to keep an eye on Jalalaty and the appellant replied that while Jalalaty was an asset, because he knew buyers for the bigger shops, they should keep “her [Jalalaty] very secret to avoid pressure from other growers, suppliers, vendors etc”.
	
	
	On 13 November 2007, Kinch told the appellant that Jalalaty kept “name dropping and having weird conversations with” the supplier and factory who “do not know anything about anything”. He also told the appellant that he was planning a meeting with Jalalaty “where I saw her here with you” and that he was working hard to get the projects back on track.
	
	
	Each of Jalalaty and Kinch were in Dubai between 13 to 15 November 2007. On 21 November, Jalalaty was recorded as saying to an unknown person, something to the effect of “When they import the drug right it comes in a form and then they pour the acid over it and the product cleans it and crystallises it and it uses hundreds of litres of it that’s what he told me”. At the trial, Counsel for the appellant did not accept that the words “when they import the drug” could be heard on the recording. Jalalaty then telephoned a Mr Michael Moraleda and discussed acetone that Jalalaty was selling. Jalalaty said that he was not concerned with price and said, “I just want it out of there because somebody finds it there how would I explain myself”. The following day, Jalalaty told the appellant that he had a guy sourcing product for him in Dubai named Mike Von Hohenberg (Mike).
	
	
	On 23 November, the appellant and Jalalaty were recorded near the NSWCC discussing the first shipment and the Customs and AQIS process. Jalalaty said, “did you know I was seeing my mate over there”. The appellant responded, “I did know you’d gone he said um I dunno about ten days ago … I expect to be seeing Myrtle [Jalalaty] in a few days”. Jalalaty then said that he was talking to another guy called Rashid and “I was hoping we could catch up … with Rashid”. Jalalaty then told the appellant that he met Kinch and his “Portuguese mate the baldy guy” at the Emirates Mall in Dubai. He said that the Portuguese mate raised the question of the money and said “I know I’ve already spoken to ah Maurice [the appellant] and he said if there’s anything we can do he said we’ve got people in all the places”. The appellant responded, “they’ll do some serious debt collecting”.
	
	
	In the conversation, Jalalaty and the appellant discussed the fumigation of the first shipment. Jalalaty said that he had gotten to know the chief quarantine officer very well and he had showed him how they slashed some of the bags to look for weevils. He said that he asked the quarantine officer if he could guarantee that his next container would be checked because he wanted a good product. He said that he told the quarantine officer that there was another shipment before Christmas. Jalalaty said that he would organise it and there would be 60 bags in it, amounting to 300 kilos. The appellant said “right down the back of the container … hopefully”.
	
	
	Jalalaty also told the appellant of a conversation he had had with Rashid where he (Jalalaty) said that he had “other products happening” and said that he asked Rashid, “how do I know when it’s coming in and how much it’s going to be” and Rachid said “first will probably be sixty bags of five kilo”. He said that Rachid asked him how many bags there were in a container and Jalalaty responded “about four and a half thousand”. Jalalaty and the appellant then discussed the amount of money that could be made from 60 bags of 5 kgs at $100,000 a kilo. There was also discussion about the possibility of detection.
	
	
	There was then a discussion about who would pick up the next shipment and Jalalaty said that it would be done by “my Portuguese mate”. Jalalaty said that he would come and pick up 30 bags and then return them and he (Jalalaty) would destroy them. The appellant asked if, when he took the bags away, the bags were marked with something that could be linked to Jalalaty’s shipment. Jalalaty said, “they’re inside the rice bags he takes”. Jalalaty explained that then the people took their products out, gave them back the empty bags, and he destroyed them. The appellant said that it was not good that people knew that it came in rice. Jalalaty then said that he could have the Portuguese guy do it in his (Jalalaty’s) factory, “take them out take out the leave the bags there that would be better”. The appellant said “that’s what I’m saying what he [the Portuguese mate] could do when you’re not there … is he should only take the inner bags he shouldn’t take rice bags so people can say oh I recognise that rice bag … as soon as they link it to rice bags they start checking on rice”.
	
	
	On 28 November 2007, the appellant was asked by an administrative manager at the NSWCC whether Kinch was still an active informer. He initially said yes and then changed his mind and said that his status had changed to inactive.
	


December 2007


	
	In this month, Jalalaty began communicating with Mike who was identified by Agent Watt as Mr Von Hohenberg, a member of the Haklander syndicate.
	
	
	On 5 December 2007, Jalalaty complained to Rashid that he had now paid US $60,000 for products worth US $17,000 and this did not look good to his accounts people. Rashid responded, “Mike is in Dubai and will contact you”. On the same day, Jalalaty told Kinch that he had received an email from Mike and sought confirmation as to whether he could discuss pricing with him and whether Rashid was still around. Kinch replied that he could discuss pricing with Mike but that they should “just stick to a few things … i am waiting for news from ras mom”.
	
	
	On 5 December 2007, a conversation between Jalalaty and Ms Jalalaty was recorded in which she asked how long the relationship with Kinch was going to continue. Jalalaty responded, “well talking after a white Christmas once we get the first one through then we’ll decide. I spoke to my little mate he said you tell me when to stop. He said to me ah and I said I’ll do as you (indistinct) said”. Ms Jalalaty replied, “I just wanted … to know that was all but I would’ve thought that as seeing how the last one was rice if they’ll get it in the next one”. Jalalaty replied, “yeah but this one’s gotta come in I’ve got to un I’ve gotta open every single box … find the three hundred bags no sixty bags put it back in there sell em (indistinct) bags of rice go through the whole (indistinct) container (indistinct) tonnes you couldn’t notice if you (indistinct)”.
	
	
	On the next day, Ms Jalalaty, in the context of a discussion about payment for freight and fumigation, asked Jalalaty “is that one that I paid for the other day is that less” and Jalalaty replied, “na that’s the next one that the one that’s … the one we want when that comes through hopefully we’ll be debt free .. we will be debt free from those people”.
	
	
	On 12 December 2007, Kinch told Jalalaty “we have everything in place for the new contacts so lets get this headache one over”. The same day, the appellant and Jalalaty were surveilled having a conversation near the NSWCC. The conversation was recorded. In the conversation, the appellant said that Jalalaty was paying too high a price for rice and Jalalaty agreed that it was 30% above market rate. Jalalaty said that he needed to make sure that if an accountant asked why he paid $13 for rice, when he only sold it for $5, he was going to say that he was “trying to buy market share”. Jalalaty said that he was “documenting everything just like you [the appellant] told me”. He said that on Kinch’s instructions, he would only use public internet sites to check Hotmail. Jalalaty said that he had not heard from Kinch (referred to as “B52”) for a whole week. The appellant said that Kinch had told him that he was trying to get some “Christmas presents done early to avoid the last minute rush”. Jalalaty responded that he had met the “Portuguese bloke” who was going to be there when the stuff arrived, “which is all fine”. He said, “that doesn’t bother me all good if they send me one container of milk powder that’s all my money gone cause that milk powder is one hundred grand”. Jalalaty said that he had already paid for the next container.
	
	
	On 19 December 2007, Jalalaty was recorded on a number of calls to Mike. Jalalaty told Mike that he had already paid US $60,000 to the people from MDL Food. They discussed the price at which Jalalaty could sell rice in Australia and Jalalaty told Mike that the price did not matter because he worked on commission. Mike stressed to Jalalaty that he must only speak to him and refuse to deal directly with the factory. On the same day, Jalalaty asked Kinch if he should travel to Germany to meet Mike. Kinch told him not to make any travel plans.
	


January 2008


	
	On 5 January 2008, Mike rang Jalalaty to discuss their business. He asked Jalalaty to come and meet him in Germany. Jalalaty emailed Kinch on that day to ask if he should go to Germany. On 7 January, Kinch wrote back and told Jalalaty to stay put “as i am waiting for rashes mom to give me some news .. if rash is not ready i will sack them and we can move forward with mike”. On 10 January 2008, the appellant and Jalalaty were recorded having a conversation near the NSWCC. There was a discussion concerning Elegant Hosiery and the first shipment. They also discussed the difficulties with payment in relation to the first shipment and whether Jalalaty should go to Germany. In that context, Jalalaty said “(indistinct) said to me hey look listen I’ve spoken to Rashid’s mum and looks like were back on track”. Thereafter, the following conversation took place:
	


“Appellant: so Rashid’s back in it

Jalalaty: Rashid’s (indistinct) so they’re trying to and the and the container is in the dry dock and the dry dock means its loaded and waiting then

Appellant: that should be that’s just rice

Jalalaty: yeah but and the the no he said to me the next will be a live one whatever that means I want it to be live I don’t want anymore

Appellant: not alive with weasels weevils

Jalalaty: no soon the live one will come he’s not stupid”.


	
	Subsequently in the conversation, the appellant asked Jalalaty if he was doing what Kinch had told him to, in regard to only going to internet cafés, and Jalalaty replied that Kinch was using another email address.
	
	
	The appellant asked whether Ms Jalalaty knew of the existence of Mike and Jalalaty replied, no. He also said that while she knew Kinch, she did not know that “he lends us the money”.
	
	
	Subsequently, Jalalaty said that the way Kinch was going, “if we get the shipment through but within six to eight weeks you’ll [the appellant] never ever have money problems ever again you wouldn’t be able to spend the interest on the money”. The appellant replied, “look I don’t do anything silly I don’t do anything ridiculous I don’t spend anything ridiculous I have a good time”. Jalalaty said that Kinch suggested putting the money with him (Jalalaty) in the National Bank of Dubai and Kinch could guarantee 20% a year.
	
	
	On 24 January 2008, Kinch was observed by Dutch investigators meeting with Rashid (Mr Weerdon), Mr Van Den Berg, Mr Haklander and Mr Dekker in the Netherlands. The next day, Jalalaty received a message, which had been sent earlier by Kinch, saying, “i have not had a chance to catch up with the girls” but have arranged “to have dinner with their mom tonight”.
	


February 2008


	
	On 14 February 2008, Rashid sent a fax to a Mr Nawaz in Pakistan, headed “Bashma International Rice Cooperation”, which included a list of things which had been agreed. It was in the following terms:
	


“Then goods check of 300 and test certificate like sample certificate is sent.

	On 25 February 2008, Jalalaty received a fax from Mr Cloutier, attaching a draft email addressed to BJ’s Fine Foods, which stated that the agreed shipment which had been “scheduled earlier 2 months ago is now ready for departing. The new factory will send you the Bill of lading and original documents as soon as … the shipment has departed”. It noted that the payment had already been received.
	
	
	On 27 February 2008, Jalalaty and Ms Jalalaty discussed their dire financial situation and Ms Jalalaty said, “the reality of the situation is that we’ve only gotta ride out probably another month until the the container arrives”. Ms Jalalaty said that Jalalaty could not keep giving money to “the little fella” (a term previously used to describe the appellant).
	
	
	On that day, Rashid advised Jalalaty that the shipment was in process. The following day, Jalalaty informed Kinch of this and said that he would have the documents within five days of the shipment leaving. Kinch replied “I see the girls tonight xx OK”.
	


March 2008


	
	On 2 March 2008, Kinch wrote Jalalaty a message stating “i was with all the children’s parents a few days ago and a few of them where upset with your behaviour they showed me your mails etc, you did it again , you contacted the vietnamese company direct … i have managed to keep things on track for the moment but please stop and think before doing silly things.” The following day, Kinch complained to the appellant, “i do not understand mirtyle [Jalalaty] … she has done the same things as last time”.
	
	
	On 7 March 2008, the appellant sent Jalalaty a text message that said, “nothing has changed from that list I showed you so the pressure is still on at my end … I have to survive that long. If you can work some magic it will repay itself soon enough”. On 9 March 2008, the appellant emailed Kinch advising that he found himself “needing 14.5 soonish”, which Jalalaty could not accommodate, and asking Kinch to transfer it to Jalalaty. Kinch agreed and asked if Jalalaty could be trusted to give it to the appellant. The appellant reassured him. Kinch asked the appellant to send him Jalalaty’s account details.
	
	
	On 10 March 2008, Rashid informed Jalalaty that he was waiting for the bill of lading.
	
	
	On 11 March 2008, the appellant and Jalalaty were surveilled meeting near the NSWCC. They discussed the risk of the container being searched by Customs. The appellant informed Jalalaty that “they only search suspect ones … otherwise they just all go through by the … tens of thousands”. The appellant also discussed his increasingly difficult financial situation. They discussed the money that the appellant had requested from Kinch and the appellant said, “I’ve got no way of getting it I need an account to send it to and it can’t be mine but I mean so can I give him yours … and that’ll take the pressure off”. Jalalaty agreed. The appellant said that he had asked Kinch for far less than he needed, but that if the situation was not resolved within a few months, he would have to go back and be honest with Kinch about the extent of his situation.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that later that day, Jalalaty sent the appellant his account details.
	
	
	On 11 March 2008, Jalalaty wrote to Kinch saying that “Maurice [the appellant] has extended himself so much and borrowed more than he can handle. … He is living beyond his means. I am selling stock for people to help him pay his debts”.
	
	
	On 22 March 2008, a fax headed “M/S Malik Sons” of Pakistan, describing the contents of a 20 foot container of white rice, was sent to Rashid’s home in the Netherlands from Pakistan. On 26 March 2008, Kinch wrote to Jalalaty telling him that he “saw the paper for rash’s project, you [Jalalaty] should have or will receive the papers … you will receive the product in approx. 3 weeks … i have passed on the number for Maurice’s predicament and you will receive a call very soon”.
	


April 2008


	
	On 1 April, a meeting took place between Jalalaty and the appellant in Jalalaty’s car, which was recorded. Jalalaty referred to an email from Kinch saying, “it says ok you’ve already paid them so therefore they’re giving you stock which you already own so and they told you that they they they’ve got a customer for you but they haven’t told you who the customer is it’s all the stuff that you’ve told me in the past”. The appellant replied, “he [presumably Kinch] doesn’t tell me anything about all that cause you know I I I I think he wants me to be like a million miles away”. It appears from the conversation that Jalalaty handed the appellant some money and there was a discussion about whether it could be put into the bank account in one hit. The appellant said that “no one will notice the bank won’t care but if it goes bad just day well was strapped you um helped me out”. Jalalaty informed the appellant that Rashid had said to him, “I’m just waiting on your on your bill of lading”. He said, “It will be there in three weeks … but rash was meant to send me the bills of lading that gives you the ship number container number you trace it on … the website … and then you’re right”.
	
	
	Later on that day, Jalalaty wrote to Kinch, “I met her today and delivery has been made”. That night, the appellant wrote to Kinch, signing off, “Thanks for your good wishes. Your extra hugs were greatly appreciated”. Agent Watt gave evidence that an amount of $9,450 was deposited into the appellant’s account on 1 April 2008.
	
	
	On 8 April 2008, Rashid rang Jalalaty and told him that the originals were being sent by UPS courier and he would refax him copies. Jalalaty then wrote to Kinch, “Spoke to Rash today Documents on their way with UPS shipment”.
	
	
	A faxed letter from MDL Food, attaching a certificate of origin for the rice and copy of the bill of lading was received by Jalalaty on 5 April 2008. The letter was signed “Rashid Abdar”.
	
	
	The appellant and Jalalaty met near the NSWCC on 9 April 2008. There was discussion about the possibility of detection. The appellant said, “we just locked up two blokes this morning”. Jalalaty said, “are there’s a lot they’re catching a lot there’s a lot coming through isn’t there … if they’re checking every single container … but they can’t … they physically can’t can they”. The appellant said that it takes 80 seconds to put a container through an x-ray machine, “but a lot of fucking around to get it there”. Towards the conclusion of the conversation, the following exchange took place:
	


“Jalalaty: (indistinct) see it’s only a few days away so (indistinct)

Appellant: (indistinct) get us get us (indistinct) rice so I can (indistinct) some rice

Jalalaty: forty kilo bag … you you if anything like if anything was to happen you you’ll hear

Appellant: (indistinct) see

Jalalaty: if I was being watched right now would you know ah you wouldn’t know

Appellant: already (indistinct)

Jalalaty: exactly

Appellant: don’t watch ordinary business men bringing in just food stuffs

Jalalaty: that’s right you have to have (indistinct)

Appellant: (indistinct) might be a bid dodgy and then half are not.”


	
	On 11 April, the appellant and Jalalaty discussed a new credit card that Jalalaty had just applied for which would allow him to borrow $100,000 at 2.9% interest “for 12 months”. He suggested that the appellant could make use of it to take “the pressure off you for twelve months” as he would only have to “come up with twelve hundred a month. The appellant replied, “hopefully we don’t have pressure for twelve months”.
	
	
	On 16 April 2008, Jalalaty again texted Rashid seeking an update on the original documents. On 17 April 2008, Jalalaty wrote to Kinch stating, “My people here have checked the number that Rash gave us and the package is supposed to be here on the 24th. I have been asking for the originals but no luck as yet If the package arrives and the paperwork is not here,then the thing will sit around attracting unwanted attention”. On 19 April 2008, Jalalaty told Kinch, “It is now confirmed. The shipment will arrive on Friday. rash says the documents have been sent”. On 22 April, Jalalaty texted Rashid, “Shipment now ariving in 2 days please i need docs urgently”.
	
	
	On 24 April 2008, Rashid received a fax at his home from a Pakistani number, containing a covering letter from MDL Food to BJ’s Fine Foods, which advised that the “original documents including Bill of Lading are forwarded to you by courier”. The fax also included copies of the bill of lading, a certificate of origin for the rice, an M/S Malik Sons packing list, a fumigation certificate and included a statement that “I HAVE nothing more 2 Send you”.
	
	
	On 25 April 2008, Jalalaty told Kinch that the ship was “already here and my customs clearance people are waiting on me”. On 28 April 2008, Jalalaty received an “Arrival notice / Tax Invoice” from MISC Agencies (Australia) Pty Ltd (MISC), i.e. Customs, advising that the consignment of 537 bags of rice from M/S Malik Sons had arrived for BJ’s Fine Foods and setting out freight charges.
	
	
	On 29 April 2008, Jalalaty texted Rashid, “We just opened the envelope and there are no originals but a demand to pay for wat i dont know wat the hell is going on can u please ring me”. The note (referred to as a “ransom note”) was recovered during a search of Jalalaty’s home. It said:
	


“Hello man

I am Sending the Photo Copy of the Documents, Because 4 the originals B/L I must Pay the MONEY to those People who c]Cleared the matter for me. Now I m bound to them if you need the original then Your side should Pay me what I axactly must Pay for these People. So Please donot delay the MONEY, So that I must Pay to get the originals.

Tanx

NOTE:- if I donot get the MONEY quickly. I Can face big problem. So please take my request seriously and finish the Problem as soon as Possible.”


	
	Thereafter, there were a series of messages passing between Kinch, Jalalaty, Rashid and other members of the Haklander syndicate, endeavouring to facilitate the obtaining of the original bill of lading and the consequent release of the shipment. It is unnecessary to set these out in any detail.
	
	
	On 30 April, Jalalaty and the appellant met near the NSWCC. The appellant told Jalalaty that Kinch was in Dubai and Jalalaty asked if Kinch told him about “the fuck up we’ve had with this container it arrived last Thursday”. The appellant said that he would ring a Customs supervisor that day and ask about a report, “I’m writing like a summary and … if you don’t hear from me everything’s fine I’ll just send … you a blank message”.
	
	
	The appellant then called a Customs analyst, Mr Gavin Whalebone (Mr Whalebone), and told him that he was “doing reference review for the Commission” in relation to the “Delgety Reference” and asked whether Customs had any evidence, “be it anecdotal or actual of um an increase in the brown powder”. After the call, the appellant sent a blank text message to Jalalaty. In his evidence, Mr Giorgiutti, the solicitor for the NSWCC, explained that the “Dalgety Reference” involved the supply of “brown heroin” from Afghanistan. He said that there was no reason why the Dalgety Reference required updating by the appellant at that time.
	


May 2008


	
	Contact between the various parties increased in May 2008. The appellant remained in contact with Kinch via the draft saved email system. The conversations, which particularly involved Jalalaty, Kinch, members of the Haklander syndicate and various persons in Pakistan, were primarily directed at obtaining the bill of lading. In that context, on 5 May 2008, Jalalaty received a call from MISC (Customs) advising him that they had received an email from Karachi telling MISC to export the container back to them. In a phone call, Rashid told Jalalaty that the persons making the demand were blackmailing them and they needed to go around them.
	
	
	Jalalaty and the appellant met on 9 May 2008. Jalalaty told the appellant that Kinch had said that he was going to “have to step in and sort this matter out” and that he (Jalalaty) had replied, “yes meanwhile my arse is getting grilled the container’s sitting there with my name on it ah what do we do” and he said “speak to maurice [the appellant] and so far as far as far as he knows it it’s ok”. Jalalaty asked, “if someone was looking at it looking at me you would have known by now” and said, “my last email to my customs agent I said if this container wasn’t paid for then I should send the bastard back”.
	
	
	On 12 May 2008, the appellant called Mr Whalebone to ask who he should ring with “some shit on information about some cargo”. Mr Whalebone told him to call Steve Mercer (Mr Mercer). The appellant then contacted Mr Mercer and told him, “I just got got a bit of info I thought I’d pass to ya all quiet in the western front is it”. Mr Mercer told him that it was and the appellant then told Mr Mercer, “he has heard very reliably that um a group of dutch guys have got a shipment of um of crystal MDMA … it’s in a consignment of of bath salts from china”. Mr Mercer told the appellant that he would do some checks and see what he could find out.
	
	
	The appellant and Jalalaty had a further meeting on 13 May 2008. Jalalaty updated the appellant on the status of the container, the original bill of lading had still not arrived. The appellant said that it was “bad” and “if there’s some somebody with bad blood they’d make a phone call” and the storage company would likely think it was strange that it had not been collected. Jalalaty said that he thought Kinch should just “pay”. He suggested that they (he and the appellant) could find someone in Customs and give them “a hundred grant to get it out for me two hundred grand five hundred grand”. The appellant said, “then you’ve got to involve people … that’s where they come unstuck those people always get found out”. The appellant also said that it would be suspicious if the container was sent back and that the industry would be suspicious about two people fighting over one container of rice.
	
	
	On 19 to 20 May 2008 Jalalaty sent and received a number of emails and made and received a number of calls regarding the shipment and tracking down of the bill of lading. Kinch faxed Jalalaty a copy of the documents that his associates had obtained on or about 20 May 2008. On 21 May 2008, Jalalaty confirmed with MISC in Sydney that he could bring the originals directly to them, pay the necessary charges and have the container released. On that day, the appellant and Jalalaty met near the NSWCC. Jalalaty updated the appellant regarding the situation with the container and the bill of lading. He told the appellant that he could not bring himself to ask Kinch for more money when he was in Dubai and they discussed the appellant’s dire financial circumstances. The appellant and Jalalaty discussed the ways in which they could be detected and the ways in which to move money into Dubai. In the course of the conversation, Jalalaty said, “but the thing is it’s not a finished product twenty … twenty-three”. The appellant said, “ah no so these are like chemicals and things like um crystal” and Jalalaty said, “yeah looks like rice”. Jalalaty also said, “the product itself won’t do anything to anyone like you opened it won’t do anything when you mix it with something else then it becomes something else”. The appellant said, “they’re making something whatever we don’t know”.
	
	
	Jalalaty again described how the product would be removed from the rice bags in his warehouse and collected by his Portuguese mate. The appellant asked if they would “take it all in one go”. There was a further discussion of how the container might be screened. The appellant also cautioned Jalalaty against the use of “helpers” because “helpers is when you go wrong”.
	
	
	Later that day, the appellant wrote to Kinch saying, “She’s [Jalalaty] painful. Met her today”. Kinch replied the following day saying, “I have at last fixed the problem”.
	
	
	Jalalaty was booked into a slot for collecting his container and having a “tailgate” inspection at 1.00pm on 23 May 2008. On that day, he obtained the original bill of lading and took it to MISC in Sydney. At 3.30pm on that day, the appellant called Customs analyst, Mr Whalebone, but as he was on annual leave in Saigon, they only spoke briefly. The appellant then called Customs Intelligence looking for Mr Mercer, but was unable to reach him.
	
	
	On the evening of 23 May 2008, Jalalaty wrote to Kinch saying that they had a 1.00pm timeslot but that there was a queue of trucks “a mile long” and “At 4.30pm there was only 2 trucks allowed to stay and the rest were told to come back Monday. Ours was left there incurring no more costs and we will be processed first or second on monday. … Today has been the longest day of life”.
	
	
	Between 23 and 25 May 2008, the AFP examined the container and found no border controlled precursors.
	
	
	The appellant and Jalalaty met at 8.44am on 24 May 2008 in Wahroonga. At the meeting, the appellant told Jalalaty about attempting to contact Mr Whalebone. On 26 May 2008, Jalalaty and Ms Jalalaty were recorded in conversation. Jalalaty told Ms Jalalaty that they were doing “a full unpack” and he was not sure if that meant he should play dumb or that they knew something, “which means … the container’s for B52 [Kinch]”. Jalalaty said, “there’s forty bags in there so I just need to be about two hundred mile ahead of them”. Jalalaty told Ms Jalalaty that the appellant had heard nothing. On the same day, the appellant rang Jalalaty, who told the appellant that he was having a terrible day because “i’m expecting a shipment through customs and they’re they’re fucking me around and my agent said that they’re un un loading everything”. Five minutes later, the appellant called Mr Mercer, the Customs liaison officer, to ask if he had anything “on that profiling stuff”. Mr Mercer told him that he had nothing.
	
	
	On 27 May 2008, the appellant and Jalalaty arranged to meet near the NSWCC. Jalalaty asked the appellant, “why would they unload the whole container … unless they knew something”. The appellant referred to his conversations with Mr Mercer and said, “we haven’t heard anything that’s the point I spoke to the guy who was getting onto a plane to Brisbane yesterday afternoon I said how’s biz he said all quiet I said we all need something he said yeah I know like dead quiet he said ah we got five hundred five hundred and one pills of this coming we got that thing there we got that like he didn’t say a word”. Jalalaty asked whether he could be lying and the appellant replied, “wouldn’t need to unless they already knew the connection but that’s very pretty unlikely”. He said that that would give them “too much credit they’re never that good”. Subsequently, the appellant said that in the time that the shipment was delayed, they would have to open all the bags, find what they were looking for, test it and replace it with something else to deliver. He said it would have taken a lot longer and in any event, “they rarely run it live” like that. Jalalaty asked the appellant, “if you were in trouble would someone let you know” and the appellant said, “some people would yeah”. The appellant instructed Jalalaty that when the container was taken to his (Jalalaty’s) place, he should behave absolutely normally, “but don’t talk near the container … just … ring that bloke that wanted to buy the rice”. He also said, “you can start ringing a few people and say look are you still interested in rice we’ve got”.
	
	
	During the course of the meeting, Jalalaty received a phone call saying that the container was being delivered that afternoon.
	
	
	Later that day, Kinch wrote to the appellant, “i just heard from mirt [Jalalaty] she seems a little worried about her exam results, i told her to relax as she can not change anything ,any way keep your eye on her”. Shortly after, Jalalaty was told that Customs had unpacked the whole container and it would be delivered on pallets.
	
	
	The rice was delivered to Jalalaty’s warehouse at 4.36pm on 28 May 2008. At 6.59pm that night, Jalalaty wrote to Kinch, “I finally got the kids home They look ok but I will need to keep an eye on them for a while”. At 11.51pm that night, the appellant read a message from Kinch which said, “just heard mirt [Jalalaty] is home from the doctors she says that the children are feeling a lot better , can you advise her to keep them off schoolnad leave them in bed as long as possible better not to remove any bandages until the doctor says”. On 29 May, the appellant told Jalalaty that Kinch had said, “just keep the children inside … and not to take the bandages off until the doctor says”. They discussed how Jalalaty could start giving the appellant “money on the record” very soon and how they would explain why he was doing it.
	
	
	On 30 May 2008, Jalalaty called a former employee, “Benny”, and asked him if he wanted a 40 kg bag of rice and they arranged for Benny to come to the warehouse the following day.
	
	
	On 31 May 2008, the appellant read a message from Kinch that said, “i am so happy that you are keeping an eye on mirt and the kids as i was really getting worries she did not seem to be couping that well,, i had a mail from her today and she sounded more relaxed”. On that day, Jalalaty received the following message from Kinch, “hi there . i do not like to bring bad news,, i just heard that ras mom and father where involved in a serious crash a few days ago!! ,, (i am not sure who they where driving for!!) they are both in there local hospital”.
	
	
	Agent Watt gave evidence that between 29 and 30 May 2008, Rashid, Mr Haklander and a number of other members of the Haklander syndicate were arrested.
	
	
	On 1 June 2008, Kinch sent an email to the appellant saying, “Can you ask Mirt [Jalalaty] to get a metal detector to take for the kids to go treasure hunting.”
	


B The appellant’s record of interview (ERISP)


	
	The appellant was arrested on 2 June 2008.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Agent Watt agreed that following the appellant’s arrest, while he and Federal Agent Venchirautti (Agent Venchirautti) were driving the appellant to the AFP premises, the appellant asked how much the police were alleging had been imported and was told 300-600 kgs. The evidence was that the appellant asked what the commodity was and was told it was pseudoephedrine. Agent Venchirautti gave evidence that he was not certain of the words used, but he thought that the appellant did refer to border controlled precursors and did not ask “what was brought in?”.
	
	
	Subsequently, the appellant was interviewed in an interview room at the AFP Headquarters. His record of interview (ERISP) was tendered. In the interview, the appellant said that he knew that Jalalaty imported goods generally, but did not know anything about a conspiracy to import pseudoephedrine. He described his financial position as “poor … serviceable but not comfortable”. He said that he got “bits and pieces” of money from Jalalaty when he was behind in a payment and estimated that this totalled around AUD $15,000 to $20,000.
	
	
	The appellant described various business plans that he had had with Jalalaty. He said that Jalalaty had said that he needed the appellant’s sales skills, that he would look at the documents, persuade people and be part of Jalalaty’s big sales team and that he hoped to make money.
	
	
	The appellant was asked if he knew of any of Jalalaty’s associates and he named Julian (Holmes) in Dubai and Warren (Stevenson).
	
	
	The appellant said that he went to Dubai “last February” with Louise Baker (Ms Baker) to meet Jalalaty’s partners. He said that Jalalaty paid for the airfares. When he was asked why Jalalaty paid for the airfares, the appellant said, “I suppose is the only answer, ‘cause he could”.
	
	
	He was asked who else he met in Dubai and named Julian (Holmes), Roger, “Julia someone”, the “guy that designed The Palm” and “an informer who you obviously know about or would be interested in um, James Kinch”. He said that he had not known that Kinch would be in Dubai when he made the arrangements with Jalalaty.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had known Kinch since he had become an informant in about 2001 and that he had given the NSWCC “some excellent jobs”.
	
	
	The appellant said that he encouraged Kinch to “use his brain and his personality to get involved in normal things”. He said that at dinner in Dubai, Kinch became interested in some of Jalalaty’s importation ideas but that there was no discussion of a business venture.
	
	
	The appellant was asked about his discussions with Jalalaty about rice and said that Jalalaty had been on a “buying tour” around Asia and had made a lot of contacts. He said that rice was a “real early possibility” but that nothing happened until a recent container of rice arrived a couple of months ago from Pakistan. He said that the container had bugs in it and he thought that Jalalaty had lost money on it.
	
	
	The appellant said that there had recently been more talk about rice but that there were the same “problems with the Pakistanis”. In that context, he said that Jalalaty told him that Kinch knew the same people and was going to sort out the problem.
	
	
	The appellant said that he did not know about the first shipment until it was over and did not know that Kinch was involved or had knowledge of it. He said that he never asked Jalalaty how it was that the person in Pakistan who was involved in the payment dispute knew Kinch. He said that he never thought that Jalalaty would import drugs. He denied any involvement in any “drug component” or having discussions with Kinch in relation to the two rice shipments.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had no knowledge of the rice coming in until he first met Jalalaty, when Jalalaty had the MISC documents, which he estimated was “within the last couple of months”. The appellant said that he did not know anything about the first importation. He said that there had never been any discussion of anything other than rice that may have been in the consignment, but said, “there’s this underlying thing he spoke of many times about misdescribing goods. He never said he, he never said he had done that but he has talked about it in the past”.
	
	
	The appellant said that Kinch had told him that he had nothing to do with the drug wholesale business, but was routinely approached by persons in the business. He said that he reported contact with Kinch if it related to “a job” but not when they talked about wives and kids and careers.
	
	
	The appellant denied ever discussing making a considerable amount of money as a result of importing containers of rice, but stated that they did discuss “millions” in relation to other projects. The appellant was asked if Jalalaty ever gave him money on behalf of someone else and he said, “Are you talking about on behalf of Kinch? No, not that he has ever said”. He said that he knew that Kinch had provided money to Jalalaty for his business. The appellant said that he did not know how it was paid or when the arrangements were made, but thought that it was in the order of AUD $800,000.
	
	
	The appellant said that Jalalaty had told him about an investment scheme that the appellant thought was too good to be true and he recounted Jalalaty’s experience losing money on the investment. He said that after Jalalaty had lost the money, he came clean that the money was from Kinch. The appellant said that he told Jalalaty that he could not help him, but put him onto a private collector, Mr Wheeler. He said that Mr Wheeler brought the person with whom Jalalaty invested the money, a Mr Way, to the NSWCC, as Mr Wheeler “brings a lot of clients to us”. The appellant said that he had done a basic AUSTRAC search for the money and saw that the money went everywhere and that recovery was hopeless.
	
	
	The appellant was played some of the listening device recordings of his conversations. He said that it jogged his memory and he now remembered knowing about the first rice shipment before it arrived. He said that he remembered talking about the fumigation problems and that it was better to have it fumigated “over there” so that it did not arrive full of bugs and lose money. He agreed that he was suspicious about the conversation concerning Elegant Hosiery, but just thought that it was a bad name for a food company. He said that he did not think that Jalalaty was importing the rice to pay back Kinch. He said that he suggested that the first shipment may have been a test because it was a cheap commodity, it may have been a test in anticipation of more expensive commodities.
	
	
	The appellant disagreed that he had given Jalalaty advice about what Customs looked for and claimed that what he said about Customs being distinct from AQIS was “pretty obvious”. He said that one reason he might have been explaining Customs x-ray procedures was that Jalalaty was going to pay him and he wanted to feel like he was contributing something.
	
	
	He said that he told Jalalaty about an old job involving different coloured olive oil drums with MDMA inside because they “considered the worse case scenario”.
	
	
	The appellant said that over his career, he tended to trust people and had “successfully turned criminals, significant ones, career criminals even, into ordinary people”.
	


C Jalalaty’s ERISP


	
	In Jalalaty’s interview by the AFP, he was asked about the first shipment of rice. He said that he organised the shipment with MDL Food through a Rashid Abdar. He was asked if he spoke to anyone who was not a customer, but had some kind of interest in the container. He said, “Maybe, I don’t know. Maybe some friends”. He said that he had a friend who was in the State Crime Commission and said, “He’s helped me with my unfair dismissal case”. He identified this friend as Mark Standen.
	
	
	Jalalaty was asked how often he spoke to the appellant, what else they discussed and if he recalled any times when they discussed the importation. Jalalaty said that they just discussed general things. Jalalaty said that he “wouldn’t know a drug if I saw it”. He was asked what was in the container and he said, “I have no idea. Product comes in, I just send it straight out”.
	
	
	Jalalaty was asked if he had ever spoken to the appellant about how the police go about their business and said, “always … I’m just interested. I ask my wife, I ask everybody … what do police do”. He said that “if these people are doing something wrong, well they need to be put away”. He said that he would not know what Rashid looked like so would not know if he had met him in Dubai.
	
	
	Jalalaty also said that he invested money himself and had been ripped-off. When he was asked where it came from, he said that it was his money, he still owed it and he was paying it back “bit by bit”. He denied that anyone gave him a large amount of money to invest which he lost and said that the money came from overdrafts and money he owed his customers, such as the “duck man” and “Steggles Chickens”. He said that he started importing other products to try and pay off his debts.
	


D Documents obtained as a result of search warrants


	
	It is unnecessary to refer to these documents in any great detail. However, it should be noted that a confidential AFP memorandum created by the AFP’s liaison officer in the Netherlands was found in a box in the appellant’s office. The memorandum advised that a person travelled to Australia in January 2003 under the instructions of Mr Haklander to organise the storage of approximately one billion MDMA tablets and a quantity of cash, that Mr Haklander was known as “Fat Ron” and that the tablets and cash were expected to be stored in a self-storage unit in a similar manner to that used in a previous NSWCC operation, codenamed “Tahoe”. Agent Watt gave evidence as to the appellant’s involvement in Operation Tahoe.
	
	
	Evidence was also given of emails between the appellant and Kinch from 3 October 2004 to 10 May 2008. In those emails, Kinch appears to provide the appellant with information on the movement of drugs and the plans of the Haklander syndicate. In many of the emails, Kinch appears to provide details of the type, quantity and method of various illegal importations which he became aware of, as well as of various other schemes and passes on the names and pseudonyms of various players. Kinch also said in one email, “i think you should have a word a find out just what i will be offered if i am prepaired to help with your enqueries”.
	
	
	Federal Agent Katherine Fox gave evidence concerning an investigation into the importation of MDMA. It is unnecessary to deal with her evidence in any detail.
	


E Evidence of witnesses


	
	A number of witnesses gave evidence concerning the appellant’s activities whilst at the NSWCC. This evidence, as is most relevant, is summarised below. This summary is largely drawn from the Part 1A Document prepared by the Crown. It was not contended by the appellant that the summary, at least to the extent that it is reproduced below, was incorrect.
	


John Giorgiutti


	
	Mr Giorgiutti was the Solicitor to, and Director of, the NSWCC. He was immediately subordinate to the Commissioner.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti became aware that the appellant was being investigated in July 2007. He assisted prosecutoring authorities by producing various documents, a number of which were tendered. He gave evidence as follows.
	
	
	The NSWCC policy regarding informers and management of informer files was tightened in 2007 with the introduction of “G3”. After G3, all informer files were centrally managed by a Ms Baird and active files were re-ordered to conform to a standard protocol.
	
	
	The appellant was an Assistant Director reporting directly to the Director, although from 1998, in practical terms, he reported directly to the Commissioner. He headed the investigative scheme codenamed “Gymea”.
	
	
	The appellant and his team were involved in numerous investigations between 1997 and 2007 relating to different kinds of drugs, including methylamphetamines. In 1997, the appellant was involved in an investigation of a conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine, which involved the seizure of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	Gymea Team Operation Anchor (codenamed Tahoe by the AFP) was tasked with identifying the people involved in trafficking large commercial quantities of illicit drugs into Australia from intelligence sourced in Europe. It was specifically set up because it was believed that former or current police officers or government officials may have been involved in such importation.
	
	
	One of the first pages in Kinch’s informer file was an AFP liaison communication from London passed to the NSWCC in relation to Operation Tahoe, naming a number of people of interest. In the document, which was dated 26 September 2002, Kinch was described as “a well documented drugs trafficker, historically based on the Birmingham area and Portugal”. The report stated that it was “further believed that if Kinch does set up in Australia he will, if not already commence large scale importations of MDMA into the country”. It stated that it appeared “that Kinch may well have been behind the recent Tahoe importations”.
	
	
	By 3 March 2003, the investigation of Kinch by the Gymea Team was well progressed. Kinch was arrested on 14 March 2003. In a meeting of the Gymea Team on 17 March 2003, it was noted that after his arrest, Kinch had agreed to supply information to assist ongoing investigations in exchange for later assistance in court. He provided investigators with the location of a further AUD $227,000 and approximately $15,000 in foreign currency and 60 kgs of MDMA. He gave information about an accomplice likely to return to the location where the cash and tablets were stored and about another planned import of three to five million pills inside furniture, or ecstasy in liquid form. Kinch was given the codename “Hogan”.
	
	
	The NSWCC had an informer management policy to govern the high risk nature of the informer/handler relationship to both parties. A system was necessary to enable the handler and agency to corroborate as much of what the informer said as possible and to review what the informer had told the handler over time to see if there were any changes in their behaviour or the way contact was initiated. These issues were highlighted in the NSWCC’s 2006 Informer Management Policy, which was reflective of the policy of previous years. The appellant was an experienced handler.
	
	
	Kinch attended the NSWCC on 18 and 20 March 2003 and provided information in relation to ongoing MDMA and amphetamine importations and money laundering. Kinch foreshadowed that depending on his charges and bail situation, he could provide information concerning principals involved in the manufacture of mass quantities of MDMA in Holland and he named “Fat Ron” and “Pete” as Dutch principals. The information report generated on 21 March 2003 in respect of these disclosures noted that “A summary of that information has been detailed in an information report by Standen”. In cross-examination, Mr Giorgiutti agreed that, despite it being more than likely that such a report existed, it was never found.
	
	
	Kinch became a registered informer in October 2003. His informer file was stamped “inactive” sometime in late 2007 or early in 2008. It stated that Kinch had provided accurate information which had been independently verified and that he was “well placed within an international drug importation syndicate based in the U.K. and supplying amphetamines produced in Holland to the Australian market”. The file showed that he had been charged with state offences of money laundering and supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, but that those charges had been withdrawn by the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (the NSWODPP), in two stages, by 27 January 2004.
	
	
	A series of emails from the appellant to the NSWCC Commissioner at the time, Phillip Bradley (Commissioner Bradley), and a subsequent letter from Commissioner Bradley to the NSWODPP, showed that the appellant had been involved in making submissions to the NSWODPP in May 2003 to the effect that Kinch would plead guilty to the drug charges in exchange for the NSWODPP not proceeding on the money laundering charges. The letter attached a submission which stated, “Whilst Kinch is an important and active member of the Dutch syndicate, it is clear that he is not one of the principles. He is one of the workers, albeit an important one”. It set out the information Kinch had already provided and the valuable seizures that had been made. It referred to the fact that Kinch had provided information that the Dutch group had “laundered between $30 million and $40 million” since he had been in Australia. It stated that “He said that an amount of $2 million is still owing from customers in Sydney and that if he were on bail, he would be prepared to collect that money and remit it … under controlled conditions”. It advised that Kinch was prepared to complete a money laundering operation under controlled conditions to enable the NSWCC to take action. It also stated that Kinch had disclosed that the Dutch group had been considering whether to kill a potential witness who may have given evidence against Kinch and whether to help Kinch escape. The submissions noted the extreme risk that Kinch foresaw in providing information about the Dutch syndicate and noted that “he was firmly of the view that [a letter of assistance to the sentencing court] was far too transparent for the people who would be following his case with extreme interest”. The submission also stated that Kinch had consented to the forfeiture of cash and real estate, worth approximately AUD $1 million.
	


Federal Agent Christopher Symons


	
	Federal Agent Christopher Symons (Agent Symons) became a co-handler of Kinch with the appellant, although this arrangement was not formalised until approximately one month after Kinch’s arrest. At trial, Mr Giorgiutti’s evidence was interposed with evidence from Agent Symons in order to maintain a chronological narrative of the appellant’s work at the NSWCC. Mr Symons gave the following evidence.
	
	
	On 28 November 2003, the appellant sent a letter addressed to the Crown Advocate responsible for the prosecution of the charges brought against Kinch. The appellant noted his understanding that the NSWODPP had rejected Kinch’s no bill application. He reiterated the value of the information that Kinch had provided, including that it “led directly to the seizure of 229 kilograms of ecstasy”. He noted that the money laundering charge had already been dropped by the Director and that Kinch had forfeited $1,300,000 in assets. The appellant conceded that Kinch did not plead guilty to the commercial supply charge, as they understood he would once the laundering charges were dropped, but that Kinch asserted that they had misunderstood the terms on which he would agree to plead guilty.
	
	
	The appellant noted that in any event, Kinch had continued to provide valuable assistance, much of which had been passed on to UK and Dutch authorities. The appellant’s letter did not appear in Kinch’s informer file.
	
	
	A summary of the phone contact between the appellant and Kinch between 15 July 2003 and 15 February 2004 showed that Kinch had called the appellant 179 times in that period, the appellant had called Kinch 97 times and that they had exchanged 37 SMS messages.
	


Mr Giorgiutti (continued)


	
	Mr Giorgiutti gave evidence that approximately $1,200,000 of cash and property in Kinch’s control was subject to a forfeiture order, by consent.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti had located an information report written by the appellant on 23 December 2004 and only recently recovered from the appellant’s personal directory on the NSWCC computer system. The informer had said, among other things, that Kinch would know where a large quantity of ecstasy imported from Europe was stored in Sydney. The informer described Kinch as a “big mover” of drugs who would know about the shipment, and gave methods and phone numbers for contacting Kinch in London. A soft copy of the report was located in the appellant’s private file directory and a hard copy was located in the informer file for the informant “China”, however, it was not disseminated to the Gymea Team, as would have been proper practice.
	
	
	On 30 May 2005, a Dutch police officer emailed the appellant and said, “We still don’t know where Haklander stays. Can our friend H tell us something about the place where he stays”. The appellant replied on 21 June 2005, advising that he had not been in touch with H recently and “he is less and less interested in passing information because we are unable to get him what he wants (to come here)”. By this time, the earlier charges against him had been withdrawn.
	
	
	NSW Police Inspector Rod Hennes (Inspector Hennes), then working with the Gymea Team, sent an email to a large number of Gymea Team members on 1 September 2005. The email referred to the appellant speaking with Kinch, who was allegedly in Spain. It said that the appellant and Kinch discussed a recent MDMA seizure from a Mr Paul Sukar by the Drug Squad. This was said to be relevant to Kinch as he was dealing with a large amount of pills to the Sukar brothers when he was active in 2002-2003. The email went on to say that Kinch (“Hogan”) asked “if ‘Keef’ (Mouse) was involved in that one, which Mark [the appellant] replied to the effect that he had no idea. Hogan [Kinch] added that he had a garbled message from Mouse indicating he might ‘take off’ because he thinks he is being looked at”. The email stated that the appellant did not take the matter any further. The evidence established that when Kinch was arrested in March 2003, he was in the company of an associate named Keith Catlow, who was also referred to as “Mouse”.
	
	
	On 13 October 2003, Inspector Hennes sent a message to the Tahoe team, including a note that Kinch had told them that “the Sukkar’s were 1 of his biggest customers prior to his arrest. It would fit that [Kinch’s] boys would continue to supply to the Sukkars. Interestingly Mark S [the appellant] had a conversation with [Kinch] about the Sukkar arrest just afterwards and [Kinch] asked about ‘Keef’ [aka “Mouse”]. (Hopefully Mark didn’t spill the beans! – just kidding, I know you’r toooo smart for that)”.
	
	
	There was never any investigation of Kinch in respect of the suspicions expressed by Inspector Hennes.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti was referred again to the information report written, but never disseminated, by the appellant on 23 December 2004, which recorded a confidential source naming Kinch as a “big mover” of drugs. He was asked what normal investigations should have followed. None of the things that Mr Giorgiutti said should have been done actually happened.
	
	
	Kinch provided information to the NSWCC that he used other money launderers in Melbourne. The NSWCC was never able to corroborate that Kinch laundered AUD $50 million to $60 million. On the basis of information provided to Customs by the appellant, implicitly originating from Kinch, on 6 September 2006, liquid MDMA was found in a shipment of oil lamps. The person responsible was not arrested before leaving Australia. Mr Giorgiutti agreed that once a method of trafficking had been uncovered by Customs, “only a dummy” would attempt an importation the same way again. This was the last recorded supply of information by Kinch to any Australian law enforcement authorities.
	
	
	After the appellant returned from Dubai in January 2007, he told Mr Giorgiutti that Jalalaty had paid for his flights. Mr Giorgiutti reported this to the Commissioner. The appellant made no mention of having met Kinch, which NSWCC policy would have required him to do.
	
	
	A statement of financial interest completed by the appellant on 15 August 2007 disclosed no gifts. A disclosure of a substantial gift of any kind, but particularly of substantial cash from Kinch or Jalalaty, would have prompted an investigation. Further, the appellant did not disclose the $200,000 loan from Mr Newton, or any interests or dealings with Jalalaty.
	
	
	The new centralised system for managing informers, G3, was implemented in May 2007. It included additional considerations, such as not providing benefits to the informer which were not officially recorded, not deriving any benefit from any reward or any other benefit provided to the informer, never giving the impression that an informer had any privilege or immunity from legal processes as a consequence of the relationship and specifically disabusing the informer of any such misapprehension.
	
	
	In 2007, Kinch was recorded as “inactive”. As far as Mr Giorgiutti was aware, the appellant did not make a contact report in relation to Kinch in 2007 or 2008.
	
	
	On 11 October 2007, an information report was generated, recording information from the informer codenamed “China”, referring to the same people as mentioned in the document of 21 August 2007, “the Sukars”, and advising that a person had told the informer that he had a contact in the AFP who tipped him off that the police were aware of a drug importation. Mr Giorgiutti referred to the email written by the appellant on 15 October 2007, referred to in par [63] above. He said that the email disclosed details of the August and October 2007 information reports. Mr Giorgiutti said that the communication was not appropriate, as it gave information, with “the potential to expose persons who provide the information to us”.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti spoke to the appellant on 4 June 2008, after his arrest. The appellant said that he had dealings with Jalalaty because he thought one of the schemes could be a winner. At a meeting with the appellant on 27 June 2008, the appellant expressed concern for the welfare of Kinch and went into lengthy detail about information Kinch had provided about a shipment of a prohibited substance packed in bath crystals.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti was shown a copy of the advice provided by the Commonwealth DPP in relation to the 2003 controlled money laundering operation and agreed that it was found in the NSWCC in hardcopy by complete chance and not as a result of searches relating to the appellant. He agreed that if it had not been found, there would have been no documentary evidence within the NSWCC showing that the operation was the subject of an advice from the Commonwealth DPP.
	
	
	Mr Giorgiutti was taken to an email exchange between Kinch and the appellant in which Kinch proposed a controlled money laundering operation on 21 March 2008 which he said might enable them to “bring a wealth of info … and get some terror stuff”. In one of the emails, Kinch said, “every one is scared of Pakistan at the moment and looking for other routes”. The appellant replied, “Yes very good reason to be scared of the Pakis at the moment”. Mr Giorgiutti was also shown documents recording the considerable work that the appellant’s team was doing at that time in relation to money laundering, in particular, in relation to a money exchange operated by a Pakistani person in Kings Cross. Mr Giorgiutti agreed that it was not appropriate and was forbidden for the appellant to communicate material relating to current investigations. He also said that the information should have been passed to the AFP and ASIO, given the reference to “terror stuff”.
	


Agent Symons (continued)


	
	Agent Symons gave evidence concerning a proposed controlled operation in October 2003. He stated that on 3 October 2003, he, the appellant and Kinch discussed $1,500,000 in cash that Fat Ron and another person were requesting for Kinch to transfer out of Australia. Kinch said that he could access the money within two hours, but refused to give control of the cash to the NSWCC. The controlled operation was planned for 31 October 2003. Kinch was tasked with making $250,000 cash available to the NSWCC no later than 30 October 2003, to provide sufficient time for counting and recording the cash before the controlled operation. Kinch attended on 30 October 2003 with a black sports bag containing about $300,000 and the money was returned to him the following day for the controlled operation. Kinch delivered the cash to the operators at the exchange point.
	
	
	At a meeting between Agent Symons, Kinch and the appellant on 4 December 2003, Kinch expressed reluctance to assist the NSWCC any further, pending resolution of his court matters. On 27 January 2004, Agent Symons advised Kinch that all of the charges had been dropped by the NSWODPP. Kinch provided further information in relation to a major “Australian customer” meeting with members of the Dutch syndicate. He departed from Australia on 15 February 2004.
	
	
	Agent Symonds gave evidence that the appellant had not said anything to him in the relevant period to suggest that he had the level of ongoing contact with Kinch that was revealed in the tally of phone calls and texts tendered. In cross-examination, Agent Symons agreed that calls in which nothing significant was said were often not recorded.
	


Commissioner Phillip Bradley


	
	By the end of January 2007 or early February 2007, Commissioner Bradley learned of the appellant’s visit to Dubai and that his expenses had been paid by a person with whom he had a business relationship. Commissioner Bradley said that he was not aware of any contact between the appellant and Kinch in Dubai, which would have been cause for considerable concern. Commissioner Bradley said that he made it clear that it was not acceptable that the appellant had travelled to Dubai and had his expenses paid by a business associate.
	
	
	Commissioner Bradley said that he was not aware of the unsecured loan from Mr Newton and would have made further inquiries had he known. He said that the appellant and Mr Newton had previously approached him for permission to become mortgage brokers and he refused their request.
	
	
	Commissioner Bradley was taken to an email sent to him by the appellant in relation to Kinch’s charges and confiscation settlement in 2003. Commissioner Bradley said that it was not appropriate that Kinch’s charges were considered a “stumbling block” to the confiscation settlement. However, he clarified in cross-examination that it was not improper to bring the connection between the charges and confiscation orders, in Kinch’s mind, to his attention.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions made to the NSWODPP in support of the dropping of the charges against Kinch, the information that Kinch was willing to plead guilty to the drugs charge, that the money laundering charges may be difficult to prove and that the assistance provided by Kinch could not be disclosed to the court, came from the appellant. However, in cross-examination, Commissioner Bradley agreed that it was possible that he may have been shown a number of documents and spoken to a number of people about Kinch before sending the letter and submissions to the NSWODPP.
	


Anthony Newton


	
	Mr Newton met the appellant when they worked together at the AFP, the National Crime Authority and later, the NSWCC. He was aware that the appellant was a handler for Kinch at the NSWCC.
	
	
	Mr Newton was also aware that from around 2006, the appellant had a business relationship with Jalalaty. He understood that the appellant’s intention was to eventually leave the NSWCC and go into business with Jalalaty fulltime. He said that he was told that the appellant was receiving income from his involvement with Jalalaty, including, over a period of time, $200,000. He said that he was told that the money was invested by Jalalaty and the person with whom they invested the money took it.
	
	
	Mr Newton said that he lent the appellant $210,000 in early November 2006 to assist him to purchase a house for approximately $700,000. Mr Newton said that he was able to lend him the money by drawing down on his own mortgage. The intention was that the appellant would then cover the interest repayments and eventually repay the principal within a matter of months, as he would refinance the loan after purchasing the property.
	
	
	Mr Newtown gave evidence that as part of his employment at the NSWCC, he was required to provide a financial declaration disclosing his personal finances and those of his family. He said that the appellant advised him not to disclose the fact that he had lent $210,000 to the appellant and Mr Newton did not disclose it.
	


Other police officers and Customs officers


	
	Detective Superintendent Amanda McCormick, Commander John Beveridge, Mr Whalebone and Mr Mercer gave evidence of the appellant’s inquiries as to Customs procedures in relation to the search of containers and, in the case of Mr Mercer, whether following the appellant’s inquiry of him regarding a shipment of MDMA, an alert had been set up.
	


Diane Jalalaty


	
	Ms Jalalaty worked with the appellant as an AFP officer in the late 1980’s. She then worked for the National Crime Authority before returning to the AFP and then resigning in 1995. On her resignation, she began working at Jalalaty’s wholesale game and poultry business. Sometime later, they established the business called BJ’s Fine Foods, which was predominantly a wholesale food business. She said that Jalalaty also established a business in Dubai with Julian Holmes called “Inspired Foods”. She said that she and her husband had a loan from the Commonwealth Bank and a $1 million loan from her sister.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty said that she remained in contact with the appellant after leaving the AFP.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty said that sometime in 2006, Jalalaty told her that the purpose of his trip to Thailand was to organise a loan from a friend of the appellant’s with the nickname “B52”, for the business to be conducted by BJ’s Fine Foods. Evidence established that B52 was a commonly used pseudonym for Kinch.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty said that in February 2006, her husband came home with a sports bag that contained $1 million in cash, which they kept in their bedroom wardrobe. She said that Jalalaty told her that the cash was given to him by a person he nicknamed, “Portuguese guy”. She said that she was aware that the money was a loan that would have to be repaid at some time but was not aware of the term or the interest rate. The money was to be used to buy products. Ms Jalalaty said that she was not aware of any additional money received from Kinch.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty said that after the money was lost, the appellant assisted the Jalalatys in their attempts to get it back. She said that the appellant organised meetings between the Jalalatys and Mr Wheeler and also took steps to find out whether the investment had left the country.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty was aware that in early 2007, Jalalaty, the appellant and “B52” (Kinch) met in Dubai. She said that she arranged the airfares for the appellant and Ms Baker.
	
	
	In July 2007, while the Jalalatys were on holiday in Port Douglas, Ms Jalalaty said that Jalalaty told her that they would import a container of rice that would contain drugs as a means of repaying the $1 million debt owed to B52 (Kinch).
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty said that she made payments to the appellant at the request of her husband. She said that she and Jalalaty used the cash from the sports bag in the wardrobe and it eventually started to run low. She had previously said that $500,000 from the sports bag had been invested with CWL, which was the money which was lost. Ms Jalalaty said that by 15 June 2007, there was about $145,000 left in the sports bag. It was understood that she and Jalalaty would need to return what they could to B52 (Kinch) via the “Portuguese guy” and by 16 June 2007, understood that B52 (Kinch) was looking for at least $500,000. However, by 18 June 2007, that figure had reduced to $300,000.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty agreed that by September 2007, she had in her possession a document indicating a requirement that they pay $6,231 to Elegant Hosiery in Pakistan without which they would not receive the bill of lading for the first shipment of rice. She said that she organised transfers to Pakistan consistent with Jalalaty’s instructions.
	
	
	Ms Jalalaty explained, by reference to the recorded conversation with her husband on 5 December 2007, that at that time she expected that the second shipment of rice would contain drugs which would pay off their debt. On 6 December 2007, she told Jalalaty that she hoped that B52 would be “reasonable” and deduct from their debt the amount of money they had paid to the appellant. In relation to the phone conversation with Jalalaty on 20 December 2007, in which Jalalaty said that he was delivering a ham to the appellant, Ms Jalalaty explained that she put a ham and $20,000 in a box to be given to the appellant. Ms Jalalaty gave evidence that her husband told her on 30 April 2008, “According to security at Customs we are not on the radar he had reason to speak with him today ringing the head of Customs”. The “he” referred to the appellant.
	


Warren Stevenson


	
	Warren Stevenson (Mr Stevenson) gave evidence that he began working with Jalalaty in late 2006. In cross-examination, he accepted that he actually first met Jalalaty in late 2005. He said that he became aware of the premises occupied by BJ’s Fine Foods, on Chicago Avenue in Blacktown, in early 2007. He described it as a large warehouse with three levels of shelving where pallets could be stored by forklift.
	
	
	Mr Stevenson said that when he first visited the warehouse in early or mid-2007, it was storing a large quantity of an energy drink. He said that there were also approximately 20 to 30 20 litre drums of acetone stored at the very back of the warehouse. He said that Jalalaty warned him to be very careful around the acetone as it was extremely flammable. He said that he was also told by Jalalaty that it could be used to manufacture Ecstasy. The acetone remained in the warehouse from the time Mr Stevenson first visited it until after March 2008, at which point there was some discussion about selling it. He said that it was ultimately sold for less than $1,000.
	
	
	Mr Stevenson gave evidence that he was aware that two shipments of rice had been imported by Jalalaty. He also said that he was told by Jalalaty that Jalalaty had $1 million in cash in a cupboard in his house. Mr Stevenson was also aware that Jalalaty had lost a substantial amount of money in an investment and had asked the appellant to assist in its recovery.
	
	
	In November 2007, Jalalaty showed Mr Stevenson a text message from the appellant requesting money and Jalalaty asked Mr Stevenson to transfer money to the appellant. On 28 January 2008, Mr Stevenson transferred $5,000 to the appellant. On 1 February 2008, he transferred a further $1,500 and on 27 February 2008, an additional $7,000, each amount originally provided to him by Jalalaty.
	
	
	After the first shipment, but before the second shipment of rice, Jalalaty changed the locks of the Chicago Avenue warehouse and kept the only key. Mr Stevenson said that on 28 May 2008, he went to the warehouse and Jalalaty was there awaiting delivery of the rice. He said that Jalalaty appeared agitated and was physically ill. He said that the rice arrived later that day and he assisted Jalalaty with unloading it. The two men met the following day in Double Bay and Jalalaty showed Mr Stevenson a 15 kg bag from the second shipment.
	


Bruce Way


	
	Mr Way explained that he arranged an investment on behalf of Mr and Ms Jalalaty through his company, Consultants Way Limited (CWL), totalling $580,000. About half of this was invested and half was used, without the Jalalatys’ knowledge, to pay CWL’s debts. Although there were in fact no returns from the investment, CWL reported monthly returns of 25% to 30% to the Jalalatys, such that as at September 2006, the Jalalatys’ statement of account showed a balance of $2,384,000. CWL never received the principal back or any interest.
	
	
	Mr Way said that in June 2007, he was visited by two large men who presented him with an acknowledgement of debt document for $860,000 and a guarantee and indemnity form for the benefit of BJ’s Fine Foods, for his signature. A few days later, Mr Way wrote to BJ’s Fine Foods recounting the visit and advising that he had spoken to police who informed him that it was “a most improper way to conduct a commercial dispute” and that in the future, they should approach him through a lawyer.
	
	
	Mr Way said that he was later visited by Mr Wheeler, who told him that he had to come and see the appellant at the NSWCC the next morning, which he did. In the interim, Mr Way phoned the appellant, who told him that Mr Wheeler sometimes brought people to see him whom he (Mr Wheeler) thought may have done something wrong. Mr Way met Mr Wheeler in the reception area of the NSWCC the following morning. They then met the appellant, who took them into an interview room. They met for about ten minutes. Mr Way said that the appellant told him that it was not a formal interview so there would be no recording. He said that they discussed the Jalalatys’ transaction, with Mr Wheeler accusing Mr Way of being a director of the company that had failed to return the investment. He said that the appellant advised that he did not think it was worth the NSWCC’s time to investigate, provided that he (Mr Way) co-operated with Mr Wheeler. However, in re-examination, Mr Way accepted that the appellant may have said “I will leave it to you and Mr Wheeler to sort out and I hope I don’t have to see you again”.
	
	
	Mr Way gave evidence that he asked the appellant if he was aware of Mr Wheeler’s business card, which said something to the effect of “discount on funerals” on the back and the appellant said something to the effect of “Frank [Mr Wheeler] has a funny way of expressing himself”. Thereafter, Mr Way said that he agreed to give Mr Wheeler all of the relevant documents.
	
	
	Mr Way then gave evidence that he spoke to Mr Wheeler on a number of occasions and Mr Wheeler said things like “accidents can happen”. Mr Way eventually agreed to, and did, assign all of the debt owed to CWL, including that arising out of the Jalalatys’ investment, to BJ’s Fine Foods.
	


Forensic Accountant Domenico Rositano


	
	Forensic Accountant Domenico Rositano (Mr Rositano) was a forensic accountant who analysed the appellant’s finances. He said that the amounts deposited into the appellant’s accounts by Jalalaty, including unattributed cash deposits, totalled $203,555.50. The total incoming funds during the period, including these transfers, his salary and the loan from Mr Newton, amounted to $689,669.
	
	
	Mr Rositano concluded that as at 30 June 2006, the appellant owed $86,881 on credit cards and continued spending against them. He said that the $210,000 loan from Mr Newton was received in the appellant’s account on 9 November 2006. He said that approximately half of it was used to pay off his credit card debt. However, by 30 June 2007, despite further deposits, the appellant again owed $112,869 on his cards. Mr Rositano said that the appellant’s total outgoings in the relevant period were $694,496.
	


Louise Baker


	
	Ms Baker gave evidence that she worked with the appellant at the NSWCC as a monitor from about September 2005 and was later seconded to ICAC in February 2007. She said that at the time that she was working as a monitor at the NSWCC, she was part of the Gymea Team Division.
	
	
	Ms Baker said that she commenced a relationship with the appellant in August 2006. She said that he told her that he eventually wanted to retire from the NSWCC and get into business with Jalalaty importing or supplying energy drinks, seafood, water and meat.
	
	
	Ms Baker said that the appellant took her to dine at expensive restaurants about once a month for the first six months of their relationship and then the frequency reduced to about once every two months. He also occasionally bought her clothing and gifts. She said that until March 2008, she and the appellant stayed at different hotels in Sydney from time to time, for which the appellant paid. She said that they would also go away for short holidays.
	
	
	Ms Baker said that she asked the appellant where the cash he was carrying came from and he told her two or three times that Jalalaty gave him a couple of thousand dollars. He did not make reference to any larger amounts of money and did not say anything to her about having received a loan from Mr Newton.
	
	
	In January 2007, Ms Baker travelled to Dubai with the appellant. She said that she was under the impression that the appellant wanted to go to Dubai with Jalalaty because he wanted to be more active in getting the business started, given that none of Jalalaty’s deals had yet eventuated. She said that Jalalaty paid for the airfares for the Dubai trip and that the appellant paid for the accommodation.
	
	
	Ms Baker gave evidence that the appellant told her that Kinch (whom he called “Jimmy”) might be in Dubai while they were there. She said that he told her that Kinch used to be an informant and he was like an old friend.
	
	
	Ms Baker said that she met Kinch in Dubai on 25 January 2007 at a dinner. At that dinner, there was no conversation about money already having been paid to Jalalaty. She said that she may have known at that point of time that Kinch was a current or previous drug importer, either as a result of her employment at the NSWCC, or the appellant may have told her.
	


F The appellant’s evidence


	
	The appellant gave evidence that he first heard of Kinch in around September 2002 through internal AFP and NSWCC communications. He said that he first met Kinch at the NSWCC on 18 March 2003, after his arrest, and he became Kinch’s co-handler. The appellant said that from an early stage, Kinch provided the NSWCC with information which led to the seizure of two substantial quantities of ecstasy. The appellant said that there was no “rule” or standard as to the level of contact between NSWCC officers and informers. He said that during the conversations he had with Kinch, they would talk about “all manner of things” beyond the ambit of Kinch’s role as an informer. The appellant explained that informers tended to respond well when treated “humanely, pleasantly, in a friendly manner”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that before Kinch left Australia in February 2004, he had a conversation or series of conversations with him about how best to stay in contact. The appellant said, “We readily reached the view that it would be unwise for him to be communicating or receiving communication from my Crime Commission computer”. He said that this was because Kinch was concerned that his criminal associates or overseas authorities might be able to access his computer. The appellant and Kinch agreed to use the draft email system. The appellant said that while he was familiar with the system from his line of work, he had never set up an account himself. He said that Kinch set up the accounts on each occasion.
	
	
	The appellant acknowledged that many of his communications on the draft email system made use of metaphor and allegory. For example, he said that “Christmas presents” and “exercise machine” were metaphors for money and “keep them off school” and “not to remove any bandages” (see par [126] above) were medical metaphors that the appellant had originally introduced relating to the container of rice and in this instance meant, “not to sell the rice yet”. In cross-examination, the appellant denied that this was a code but conceded that he, Jalalaty and Kinch used the “same language when communicating”.
	
	
	The appellant agreed that the frequency of contact with an informer would depend on the value of the informer. He said that on a scale of 1 to 10, he would rate the value of Kinch as an informer at 10.
	
	
	The appellant explained that it was his understanding that by the end of 2004, Kinch had established legitimate business interests. When asked in cross-examination why Kinch was still supplying criminal information after embarking on legitimate business, the appellant said, “I never said he wasn’t in contact with them. He [Kinch] had always said that he maintained appearances with some people, with others he said he’s retired, and with others he would simply say to them ‘I’m already working’ which, in their world, means that you don’t ask questions unless you are invited to do so”.
	
	
	The appellant denied having any telephone contact with Kinch during the period that the surveillance warrants were active, but acknowledged that they had, on at least one occasion, discussed an “intention” to do so.
	
	
	The appellant said that he met Jalalaty through Ms Jalalaty. He said that by the end of 2005, he was considering a change from his career in law enforcement. He said that he developed an independent relationship with Jalalaty from 2005. He gave evidence of having acquired a provisional patent for a water saving device and of asking Jalalaty whether he knew people who would be able to assist in marketing the invention.
	
	
	The appellant said that at some point in 2005, he and Jalalaty became more engaged in their discussions about a joint business enterprise. He said that Jalalaty proposed that they should acquire distribution rights to a number of products produced by a European company called Bavaria, including an energy drink called B52. The appellant also gave evidence of a proposal to import a clothing brand called Cross Clothing from Turkey.
	
	
	In December 2005, Kinch expressed his desire to give the appellant a Christmas present. The appellant said that he accepted the idea as a nice gesture. Kinch intended the transfer of a sum of money to assist the appellant with corrective eye surgery. The appellant suggested that he transfer the funds into Jalalaty’s account, saying that “a transfer from the name James Kinch into my account would ring alarm bells at the Crime Commission” and that the NSWCC would not approve of the transfer.
	
	
	The amount of the Christmas present paid into Jalalaty’s bank account was $47,500. The appellant said that he was surprised, as he had anticipated an amount of around $5,000. The amount was left in Jalalaty’s bank account and drawn as needed. In cross-examination, the appellant acknowledged that the NSWCC guidelines prohibited failing to report gifts received from informers. He also conceded that his receipt of $47,000 from an informer would be a very serious matter.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that during 2005, he told Jalalaty about his relationship with Kinch and, in broad terms, about their dealings together. He also kept Kinch appraised of his own business plans with Jalalaty and said that Kinch told him that he thought the appellant “could do a lot better than being tied to the office”. He said that Kinch in turn expressed interest in the business, especially the Bavaria distribution rights and the Cross Clothing scheme and asked if he could assist from “the European end”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that at some point in early 2006, Jalalaty was on the “threshold” of acquiring much anticipated rights to distribute Bavaria products. When it appeared that the deal would fall through due to cash difficulties, Kinch said that if the “numbers stack-up”, his venture capital company may be able to provide finance.
	
	
	The next communication that the appellant said he received was from Jalalaty who said, “I just met my new best mate” who “Gave me a million dollars in a bag”. The appellant dismissed this at the time as just “another Bill [Jalalaty] story”. When Jalalaty later insisted that he had received $1 million, the appellant assumed that, because of Kinch’s enthusiasm in the venture and his request relating to international transfers, Kinch had actually transferred a substantial sum of money into Jalalaty’s bank account by way of investment. The appellant said that the receipt of $1 million was never mentioned again.
	
	
	Over the course of a number of conversations, the appellant formed the impression that Jalalaty was spending Kinch’s investment on various items setting up the new business. Jalalaty also told him that he was investing a sum of his own money with an American bank after being introduced to the scheme by some relations of Rene Rivkin. The appellant agreed to ask Kinch about a further investment in Jalalaty’s business in April 2006 of around $200,000.
	
	
	The appellant said that during 2006, he and Jalalaty communicated a great deal about a variety of proposed business ventures. In this context, the appellant became aware that an associate of Kinch, James Doyle, had purchased a cleaning products company called “Germ Chase” in the United Kingdom and was soon to visit Australia. He said that Doyle was a person of interest to the NSWCC and the appellant wished to acquire Doyle’s telephone number for the purpose of surveillance. He said that he told Jalalaty that a friend of Kinch’s had purchased a cleaning business in the UK and was looking to start up in Australia and that if Jalalaty knew about where acetone could be purchased, in what quantities, and for how much, then “it may be necessary for the fellow who purchased the cleaning company to get in touch with him”. The appellant said that he thought that by these means, he might discover Doyle’s phone number.
	
	
	The appellant said that Jalalaty did not understand his limited role, or that it was a subterfuge, and over-enthusiastically purchased $30,000 worth of acetone and a dispensing mechanism. On 24 September 2006, Jalalaty emailed the appellant asking what Kinch wanted done with the acetone. The appellant replied saying, “B52 [Kinch] apologised for the inconvenience”. However, the appellant said that Kinch did not know about the acetone and that he had made up his response to Jalalaty’s email. He said that he did this because he was “starting to get a sense of unease about the state of the business”. In cross-examination, he said that he did not believe that Jalalaty bought the acetone at all and was simply making up a reason to pocket business funds. However, the appellant gave evidence that by October 2006, he (the appellant) was “Getting slightly more involved [in the business because] because it sounded more promising”.
	
	
	The appellant said that it was around August 2006 that he made the decision to purchase a house. He said that the decision related to “personal difficulties”, which was why he accepted Mr Newton’s offer of a loan. In cross-examination, he conceded that he had not been truthful with his mortgagee, RAMS, or Commissioner Bradley about his finances in connection with the purchase of the home.
	
	
	The appellant said that throughout 2006, he and Jalalaty had been discussing a trip to Dubai in order for the appellant to meet a business associate of Jalalaty, Julian Holmes, and to see the opportunities in that market. He said that towards the end of the year, Jalalaty moved towards a January 2007 date for the Dubai trip and offered to pay for Ms Baker to visit as well. He said that it was unclear, until about a week prior to the appellant’s arrival, whether Kinch would also be in Dubai at the time. In cross-examination, the appellant maintained that while there was always a possibility of Kinch being in Dubai at the time of the trip, it was no more than that.
	
	
	The appellant said that he understood that Jalalaty went to Thailand in March 2007 in furtherance of a tender for the supply of salmon fillets to the airline, Emirates. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked about an email that he received from Kinch on 13 March 2007 that included the details of the Sheraton in Bangkok. He said that he did not make a connection at the time and maintained that he did not realise that both men were in Thailand at the same time.
	
	
	The appellant understood that Jalalaty had made a significant investment in an American bank. He said that he had not heard of Mr Way. He said that he had heard from Jalalaty that there were issues with the investment from December 2006, but first learned in March 2007 that Jalalaty had, in fact, used Kinch’s money. The appellant introduced Jalalaty to Mr Wheeler to assist him to recover his funds and also sought, via the NSWCC’s AUSTRAC database, confirmation that the funds had gone overseas. He did not concede that there was anything improper about doing this.
	
	
	The appellant said that Mr Wheeler was regarded as a community source. File notes from meetings that the appellant had with Mr Wheeler in July and August 2003 were tendered. They included comments that Mr Wheeler was extensively recorded on the COPS system in relation to his standover activities.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that from this stage and throughout 2007, Jalalaty began referring to the possibility of entering into an illicit scheme. He said that at some point, Jalalaty said that he had a plan that “B52 [Kinch] could just put something in one of the shipments and it will all be fixed up”. The appellant said that he responded, “Look just make the trading work”. He said that “That theme or conversation was repeated on most occasions” that he saw Jalalaty. He said that he asked Jalalaty, on a subsequent occasion, whether it was based on anything Jalalaty had been told and that Jalalaty “made a strange comment, … ‘No, but that’s the really clever bit. He never says anything. He just says “I will be in touch”’”.
	
	
	The expression, “the unlawful scenario”, developed into a shorthand term for the appellant’s understanding of what Jalalaty would hint at from time to time.
	
	
	The appellant stated that in relation to some of these conversations, he adopted what he described as the “reflective approach”. He did not argue directly with Jalalaty but tried to use themes arising in conversations to move the discussion along. He said that this approach could include repeating particular phrases used by Jalalaty.
	
	
	The appellant described his view of Jalalaty as mixed. On one hand, he had seen him as a competent and capable businessman, but on the other, he had seen “the odd” side of him, adopting Kinch’s expression “a Walter Mitty”.
	
	
	In late May or early April 2007, the appellant had a phone call with Kinch. Kinch said that Jalalaty was telling people that he was involved in “transport”, meaning the transport of illegal products. Kinch expressed bemusement at this and concern that Jalalaty “might be a nutter”. The appellant expressed the view that Jalalaty was “harmless”.
	
	
	The appellant was taken to the recording of his conversation with Jalalaty during their meeting of 15 September 2007, to which we have referred in pars [44]-[50] above. The appellant said that at that stage, his expectation that the rice was part of an illicit scheme was “zero”. This was because he had made clear to Kinch that there was to be no illegal activity, Jalalaty was never consistent on the subject and Kinch was unaware at that stage that Jalalaty had lost his investment.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence concerning that part of the conversation which related to Jalalaty, noting that it was unusual that a company called Elegant Hosiery would export rice (see par [44] above). He said that when he (the appellant) replied, “All sorts of companies do all sorts of stuff”, his “mind was trying to work out what the word ‘hosiery’ meant, and then my response is quite obvious”.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had not previously heard that AQIS had a policy of inspecting goods at the port of loading. He said that when he described what Customs might do with the shipment, he was just describing the difference between Customs and AQIS, without going beyond publicly available information.
	
	
	The appellant said that this was the first occasion that he had heard that Kinch was involved in the importation of rice. The appellant said that, as before, he was concerned that Jalalaty was communicating in an inappropriate way with Kinch, but was pleased that their joint business interests were moving forward at last.
	
	
	The appellant said that apart from a specific concern that he had that Jalalaty would disclose information concerning the health of Kinch’s daughter, there was no need to circumscribe communications between Kinch and Jalalaty. He did, however, describe to Jalalaty the means of using the draft email system because Jalalaty had heard him discuss it and was “excited” about it.
	
	
	In November 2007, the appellant and Kinch exchanged a number of emails. The appellant said that these related to their various possible business ventures.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence concerning the email message from Kinch of 4 November 2007, to which we have referred in par [69] above. The appellant said that in the email, Kinch’s expression of relief that they had not let Jalalaty loose with their “pension fund” communicated a general view to not put hope in Jalalaty, rather than a reference to any specific sum of money. The appellant also gave evidence regarding a subsequent email of 12 November, in which Kinch said, “I would appreciate it if you [the appellant] would keep an eye on her”. The appellant said that he understood that to be a “precautionary word here and there … to … make sure you don’t say anything about, you know, Jim and me or something to that effect”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence concerning the meeting with Jalalaty of 23 November 2007, to which we have referred in pars [72]-[75] above. The appellant said that he understood Jalalaty’s reference to “sixty bags” to be a reference to a quantity of something unlawful. He did not know what Jalalaty meant which he referred to 300 kgs. The appellant, referring to his response, “right down the back hopefully”, said that he made “a somewhat ludicrous statement, that if there is something unlawful in the container then hopefully it’s right down the back”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that he was concerned that Jalalaty appeared to be involved in an unlawful scheme, but still allowed very little credibility to anything he said. He said that he did not wish to confront Jalalaty, consistent with his usual approach, and also wished to continue receiving financial support from him. The appellant also said that he did not ever consider that he was a recipient of profits from unlawful activity because he never considered that there was any unlawful activity.
	
	
	In the conversation of 15 September 2007, Jalalaty expressed some calculations using a figure “$100,000 a kilo”. The appellant said that he thought that Jalalaty was just picking up the figure that the appellant had himself come up with during that conversation.
	
	
	The appellant was asked about the meeting that he had with Jalalaty on 12 December 2007, to which we have referred in par [81] above. The appellant said that in this conversation, as with previous conversations, he was playing along with Jalalaty when he mentioned Kinch or illegal activities. He said that his explanation was the same as the explanation he gave regarding the 23 November conversation.
	
	
	The appellant referred to that point in the conversation where Jalalaty said, “I am supposed to unload it myself. I don’t know what I’m looking for”. The appellant said that he took that to be a reference to it containing something illegal. However, within moments, Jalalaty was talking about an insurance claim relating to a roof on one of his properties. The appellant said that he just viewed this as more evidence that Jalalaty was not credible.
	
	
	In telephone conversations recorded on 14 and 18 December 2007 between the appellant and Jalalaty, Jalalaty referred to hams and Christmas presents from Kinch. The appellant said that this was a reference to meat products, which Jalalaty had given him in the past and to presents of money from Kinch.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence of the conversation that he had with Jalalaty on 10 January 2008, which we have referred to in par [83] above. The appellant said that after Elegant Hosiery was mentioned, he tried to steer the conversation away from the vague but familiar topic of the unlawful scenario. He said that he understood the reference to a “live” one in the conversation to be a reference to an illegal shipment. However, he stated that he did not believe that Jalalaty was really going to import anything illegal. The appellant said that he did not recall what was going through his mind when he asked Jalalaty if he was following Kinch’s instructions about going to internet cafés.
	
	
	The appellant was cross-examined about his finances at that time and he agreed that it did not make sense that his situation was “dire” if he had all of his sources of income.
	
	
	The appellant was asked about the meeting he had with Jalalaty on 11 March 2008, to which we have referred in par [95] above. He said that the information that he gave to Jalalaty about Customs procedures was in response to his questions and did not go further than publicly available information. The appellant explained that, as before, he understood Jalalaty to be hinting that something illegal was to occur, but did not really believe him. He said that he tried to steer him back towards talking about legitimate business.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence about the conversation that he had had with Jalalaty on 1 April 2008, to which we have referred in par [99] above. He said that in this conversation, he adopted what he had previously described as the reflective approach, not confronting Jalalaty about nonsensical subjects or inferences of illegality.
	
	
	The appellant said that he recalled the conversation of 9 April 2008, to which we have referred in par [103] above. He said that he thought that Jalalaty was talking about “the unlawful subject would I hear from customs or police or whoever”. He said that in response, “I screwed up my face and shrugged my shoulders in a gesture suggesting how the hell would I know which prompted him to say: You wouldn’t know”.
	
	
	So far as the conversation on 30 April 2008 was concerned (see par [110] above), the appellant said that despite what he had said to Jalalaty, it was never his intention to ask Mr Whalebone about the container and indeed, he did not.
	
	
	The appellant said that Jalalaty told him about what he described as a ransom note. He said that it was the first time that he had heard of such a document, stating, it was “all a bit weird”. In relation to the conversation on 13 May 2008 (see par [115] above), the appellant said that he “didn’t accept anything of these things [that Jalalaty had said were suggested by Kinch] as being genuine conversations he was having with Mr Kinch”. He said that he thought that Jalalaty was making the whole story up.
	
	
	The appellant referred to the reference to “crystal” in the conversation he had with Jalalaty on 20 May 2008, to which we have referred in par [116] above. His explanation was that he was about to say, “‘Oh you mean like a stir fry’ and then I didn’t and instead I said ‘Oh, so, like, chemicals and things like crystal’”. He said that he was “trying to think of something that would look like rice”, saying that “for some bizarre reason, harking back to school days, potassium permanganate came to mind, which is Condies crystals”.
	
	
	The appellant referred to his meeting with Jalalaty of 27 May 2008, to which we have referred in par [123] above. He said that he thought Jalalaty looked unwell. He said that Jalalaty removed his mobile phone battery and indicated to the appellant that this was significant. The appellant understood that this was related to a concern about listening devices. The appellant said that Jalalaty’s behaviour concerned him and he was not acting like his normal self. The appellant said that when he made the remark, “Definitely rare rare and not good”, about the prospect of Customs completely unloading the container, he was concerned about the prospect of further delay and the costs which would be incurred.
	
	
	In relation to the reference to Steven Mercer in the conversation and his response to Jalalaty’s question about whether Mr Mercer could be lying, the appellant said that he just “made it up” and he had “no reason to think one way or the other about that”.
	
	
	The appellant was referred to his conversation with Jalalaty of 29 May 2008 (see par [126] above). He said that he was still attempting to get Jalalaty to move forward and sell the rice. He said that he was growing increasingly concerned that the NSWCC might think that there was something suspicious in their relationship and sought to discourage Jalalaty from excessive communication.
	
	
	The appellant said that he understood the reference to “kids” in Kinch’s email of 28 May 2008 (see par [126] above) to be a reference to the container. He said that he thought that the amount of attention that he was supposed to apply to a container of rice was disproportionate to its value, but was not so surprised because Jalalaty had been involved in such a protracted dispute over it. The appellant denied that he understood “kids” to be a reference to drugs in the container.
	
	
	The appellant was asked about his answers to questions in the interview of 2 June 2008, in relation to the unlawful scenario. He said that what he said was true, to the best of his knowledge at the time. He admitted that he was not completely truthful in stating how much money he had received from Jalalaty, because he was convinced that the money was legitimately sourced and knew that if he had received funds from the conspirators, it would prejudice the officers against him. He conceded that this exchange was deliberately false.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had not lied when he said that he had no knowledge of the first rice importation until after it happened. He said that he just did not recall at the time, but remembered when he heard the words “Elegant Hosiery”.
	


The conviction appeal


	
	In his notice of appeal, the appellant relied on five grounds of appeal against his conviction. Ground 2 was abandoned at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	Ground 3, as formulated, was that the trial judge erred in refusing an application for a directed verdict in relation to Count 1 of the indictment. The ground was abandoned during the hearing, but was sought to be reformulated into an amended ground which asserted a misdirection of the elements of Count 1.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal first with Ground 1, then with the proposed reformulated Ground 3 and thereafter with the remaining grounds.
	


Ground 1

“The trial judge erred in admitting:

(i) documentary records of the NSWCC and oral testimony regarding those records;

(ii) evidence relating to the possession of acetone by Jalalaty;

(iii) evidence relating to the drug ‘MDMA’; and

(iv) evidence of ‘lies’ by the appellant.”


	
	This ground raises four separate issues. These issues will be dealt with separately.
	


Ground 1(i)

A The argument at trial and the approach of the trial judge


	
	Because of the structure of the appellant’s submissions, it is necessary to make some remarks concerning the way that the issue of the admissibility of the material complained of was dealt with at the trial. The first thing to be noted is that documents falling within the area the subject of this ground were separately considered and ruled upon by the trial judge. We have attached, as a Schedule to this judgment, a Schedule of the NSWCC documents which became Exhibit 37 in the proceedings.
	
	
	It should be noted that at trial, senior counsel for the appellant took no objection to documents which post-dated 1 October 2005. No argument was addressed on Documents 58-74 in the Schedule, these documents having been admitted without objection. Thus, no error was made in respect of the admission of those documents.
	
	
	Further, at trial, senior counsel for the appellant accepted that Documents 10, 11 and 15 were admitted as evidence of the notice that the appellant had of the criminal activities of Mr Kinch. Unsurprisingly, no objection was taken to Documents 1-4.
	
	
	Document 16, confidential minutes of the meeting of the Gymea Team dated 17 March 2003, was admitted over objection. We have set out the functions of the Gymea Team as it emerged in the evidence in pars [164]-[166] above. The minutes show that Mr Standen attended a meeting of the Gymea Team on that day. We have set out the relevant part of the minutes in par [166] above. In relation to that document, the trial judge pointed out that it was admissible on the same basis as senior counsel for the appellant accepted that Documents 10, 11 and 15 were admissible.
	
	
	Document 18 was admitted only in part. The part which was admitted showed that Kinch informed the Commission on 18 or 20 March 2003 of the method of email communication which was alleged to have been used during the course of the conspiracy and of the fact that “Fat Ron” was a Dutch principal.
	
	
	So far as Document 22 was concerned, the trial judge admitted two emails of 5 May 2003 and 21 May 2003 from Mr Standen to Commissioner Bradley, the first of which stated that the issue of the money laundering charge against Kinch was “the stumbling block to our confiscation settlement”.
	
	
	Document 23, which was established by extrinsic evidence to have been prepared by the appellant, was a report dated 23 May 2003, prepared at the same time as the emails to which we have referred in par [170] above. We have referred to the contents of the report in par [170].
	
	
	Document 25 was the NSWCC’s informer file on Mr Kinch. The trial judge admitted certain individual documents in the file. His Honour admitted the payment record, which had no entries. He also admitted the informer registration details for Kinch. We have summarised the contents of this document in par [169] above. The trial judge also admitted what he described as “Yahoo emails” from Kinch to the appellant. The first two emails, sent in October 2004 and January 2005, involved Kinch attempting to obtain information from the appellant. The balance of the documents in this bundle were admitted either at the request of, or with the consent of, senior counsel for the appellant, with the exception of a document setting out Kinch’s criminal history, which the trial judge admitted.
	
	
	Document 35 was an email from a Barry Sutherland. The portion of the email that was admitted stated, in effect, that as it had been a while since any update “from the Dutch” had been received, Standen and Mr Sutherland rang “them” yesterday and were told by “Dutch authorities” that “Fat Ron” was not the same person as a Yaron Abraham. The email said that “Hogan [Kinch] seems to concur” with the conclusion of the Dutch authorities.
	
	
	Document 36 was a submission by the NSWCC to the Crown Advocate dated 28 November 2003, signed by the appellant. The submission concerned the prosecution of Kinch. It stated that Kinch had previously been a high quality informant and that because of safety concerns, his “assistance could not be recognised in the usual way” so the money laundering charge against him, described as “far from strong”, was withdrawn. It stated that Kinch had agreed to forfeit $1.3 million in assets. It also stated that Kinch claimed that he did not give an undertaking to plead guilty to the remaining drug charges.
	
	
	The letter stated that Kinch had “provided a very detailed account of a group of Sydney-based business people who were responsible for laundering not less than $60 million in cash during 2002 and early 2003”. It stated that Kinch had agreed to assist in an investigation into this and that he had “informed the Commission that Dutch criminals had a further $1.5 million … which they wanted Mr Kinch to take to the … money launderers”.
	
	
	The letter also referred to a controlled operation which occurred after written advice was given from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth DPP) that a payment of $300,000 was made by Kinch to the money launderers.
	
	
	The letter was admitted on terms that it would not be said that there was any misrepresentation of the advice which had been given by the Cth DPP.
	
	
	Document 43 was the consent order relating to the confiscation of assets, referred to in the letter of 28 November 2003.
	
	
	Document 46A was the report of 23 December 2004, to which we referred in par [176] above. In admitting it, the primary judge expressly stated that he took into account the fact the defence had received late notice of the document.
	
	
	It is not clear whether objection was taken to Documents 49 and 53. Document 49 was the email of 21 June 2005, to which we have referred in par [177] above. Document 53 was the email from Inspector Hennes to members of the Gymea Team, referred to in par [178] above.
	
	
	Document 104A was a summary of telephone contact between the appellant and Mr Kinch. It recorded a very large number of calls between the appellant and Mr Kinch between 15 July 2003 and 15 February 2004. We have referred to the summary in par [174] above.
	
	
	The trial judge, in addition to considering the documents, gave written reasons for his decision. In a judgment dated 26 May 2011 (R (Commonwealth) v Mark William Standen [2011] NSWSC 1044), he stated his conclusion in the following terms:
	


“[2]   I consider that all of the documents the admissibility of which was disputed, which I ruled should be admitted, are relevant and of substantial probative force as being capable of showing one or more of the following:

Kinch's history of criminality particularly in the importing and trafficking of illicit drugs and that this history was known to the accused; the frequency of contacts between the accused and Kinch in 2003 - 2004; that the relationship between the accused and Kinch in 2003 - 2004 developed far beyond the usual handler-informer relationship; that the accused made representations in favour of Kinch stating matters more favourably to Kinch than was warranted; the beginnings of an improper relationship between the accused and Kinch rendering it more probable that a fully corrupt relationship was in existence during the period alleged in the indictment; matters which can be linked to other matters which occurred during the alleged conspiracy; and that after Kinch left Australia in February 2004 he was still involved in the trafficking and distribution of drugs.

[3]   I do not consider that, in the case of any of the documents there was any danger, if the document was admitted, of unfair prejudice to the accused or of collateral issues arising or of procedural unfairness to the accused or any likelihood that the weight which should be given to the document could be significantly affected by other records of the Commission which have not been retrieved.”

B The parties’ submissions


	
	The appellant’s submissions on this ground, both oral and written, were unsatisfactory. They did not condescend to identify which actual documents, or what portion of the oral testimony given at the trial, was the subject of the ground.
	
	
	This was in contrast to the approach taken at the trial, where documents presumably covered by the ground were the subject of argument and were considered individually by the trial judge.
	
	
	In his written submissions, the appellant complained that the material the subject of this ground ought to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The material was described in the submissions as “information reports, and other NSWCC records, relating to Kinch; correspondence relating to representations made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, NSW, by the NSWCC; correspondence between the Director of Public Prosecutions, Commonwealth, and the NSWCC, regarding a controlled money laundering operation using Kinch; miscellaneous information and reports from other ‘informers’ relating to ‘the Dutch’, Kinch and other matters”.
	
	
	The appellant acknowledged that at the trial, it was conceded that the material could possibly be relevant as showing Kinch’s knowledge of prohibited drugs and his criminal history, the appellant’s knowledge of drugs, the appellant’s non-compliance with NSWCC procedures regarding the handling of informers and the appellant receiving benefits from Kinch.
	
	
	The appellant contended, incorrectly, that notwithstanding these matters, objection was taken at the trial to the whole of the material.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that there were a number of important matters which demonstrated the prejudicial nature of the material. He submitted that they included the impact that the admission of such evidence would have upon the length of the trial, “especially given the jury’s complaints”, the nature and the incompleteness of the records, that the evidence was credibility evidence and not admissible, the probative value of the evidence, its capacity to be misused through tendency reasoning and unfairness in having to meet the allegations.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the danger of reliance on the evidence was demonstrated on three separate occasions. He submitted that this occurred in relation to the asserted inferences, first, that the appellant made representations in favour of Kinch which were more favourable than warranted, second, that the appellant misled the NSW DPP about the lawfulness of a controlled operation involving Kinch and third, that certain documents were located on a file assigned to a particular informant.
	
	
	In support of the first matter, the appellant referred to a NSWCC Report of 21 March 2003, which said that Kinch had proved extremely reliable. He also pointed to the fact that in his remarks on sentence, the primary judge had found that he was not in a position to make a finding that the letters written to the NSW DPP in support of dropping the charges against Kinch were improper.
	
	
	In relation to the second matter, the appellant pointed to the fact that the Cth DPP ultimately confirmed that the controlled operation would not be unlawful.
	
	
	In relation to the third matter, the appellant pointed to the fact that, following a ruling in relation to the admission of some of the documents, the Crown informed the trial judge that the information relating to the money laundering and the controlled delivery were in fact found in Mr Standen’s office. He also noted that the Crown had informed the trial judge that documents which had been said not to be on the informer file were in fact on it.
	
	
	The appellant also referred to other evidence that he claimed was highly prejudicial. This included evidence suggesting that the appellant leaked information to Kinch about the execution of a search warrant, suggesting misconduct in relation to the appellant’s work on “Operation Magazine”, and the assertion that the appellant “‘buried’ a 2004 ‘Information Report’ relating to Kinch”. He submitted that based on that evidence, the Crown had invited the jury to conclude that the appellant had engaged in corrupt conduct. He submitted that the evidence raised complex matters that the jury could not possibly understand. The appellant submitted that the totality of this evidence was likely to reinforce adverse views about the appellant in the mind of the jury.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the nature of the relationship between the appellant and Kinch was of central importance in the trial. It submitted that it was the prosecution case that the relationship became improper sometime after Kinch’s arrest in 2003 and the corrupt relationship formed the essential background to the formation of the conspiracy. The Crown noted that the appellant’s contention, by contrast, was that the relationship commenced as a legitimate handler/informer relationship and developed into a friendship, “animated by the joint pursuit of potential business opportunities”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the NSWCC documents also provided evidence of the appellant’s knowledge of the criminal activities of Mr Kinch and his connection with the Haklander syndicate.
	
	
	The Crown listed a number of inferences which it said could be drawn from the NSWCC material, including, but not limited to, those indicated by the trial judge in the passage of his judgment to which we have referred in par [306] above. One of the matters that the Crown pointed to was the intensity of the telephone communications prior to Kinch leaving Australia in February 2004 and the significant reduction of communications during the conspiracy period, indicating a deliberate change in the communication practice.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence did not constitute tendency evidence, nor did its use involve tendency reasoning. It was submitted the evidence provided a relevant context to understand evidence of the appellant’s and Kinch’s participation in the illegal enterprise and contradicted any innocent explanation of their dealings and communications with one another.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial. It submitted that it did not result in an undue expenditure of time or lengthening of the trial. It was submitted that, to the extent complaint was made that the material was hearsay, the issue was not properly identified, as there was no reference to the precise use that was to be made of individual documents. To this may be added the fact that no objection on this ground was taken at the trial.
	
	
	In relation to the contention that the admission of the records was unfairly prejudicial as the records were incomplete, the Crown submitted that any forensic point could be taken up in cross-examination or in submissions.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the documentation was relevant for non-credibility purposes and, to the extent that it suggested that the appellant was of bad character, it was not a proper basis to exclude the evidence.
	
	
	The Crown made additional submissions concerning the representations made on behalf of Kinch to the NSW DPP by the NSWCC on 23 May and 28 November 2003, to which we have referred in pars [170] and [172] above. It submitted that the Crown case was that the May document understated Kinch’s criminality and overstated the value of his assistance. It was submitted that the fact that the trial judge did not make a positive finding that the representations were improper did not make the material inadmissible.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown gave an example of the relevance of the evidence by reference to Document 23, the report of 23 May 2003. He pointed out that it reported that Kinch had claimed that the Dutch syndicate had laundered $30 million to $40 million and $2 million was still owing. He noted that other evidence was that by 2004, Kinch was claiming that he no longer controlled the money. In those circumstances, senior counsel submitted that it could not be inferred that when $1 million was paid from Kinch to Jalalaty, it was sourced from some legitimate business.
	


Consideration


	
	In his written submissions, the appellant complained that the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. It is implicit in that submission that the evidence was relevant. The appellant was correct in accepting that this was the case.
	
	
	The issue in the proceedings was whether the activities carried out by the appellant, Kinch and Jalalaty were in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged against them or were conducted, at least so far as the appellant was concerned, as part of a genuine commercial arrangement to import legal products into this country. The nature of the relationship between the appellant and Kinch during the period leading up to the time of the alleged conspiracy was relevant to the consideration of this issue. The trial judge, in those circumstances, was correct in concluding that the evidence rendered it more probable that a fully corrupt relationship was in existence during the period alleged in the indictment.
	
	
	As we indicated, the appellant acknowledged that it was conceded at the trial that the evidence was relevant to prove certain matters. The appellant did not contest the correctness of this concession.
	
	
	However, in addition to the matters conceded by the appellant, the NSWCC evidence demonstrated that the appellant was involved in an entirely inappropriate relationship with Kinch, the nature of which was concealed from the NSWCC. The evidence of a large number of telephone calls made between the appellant and Kinch (Document 104A in the schedule), not disclosed to the NSWCC, the receipt of gifts from Kinch, including the $47,000, the failure to investigate the matters raised by Inspector Hennes, to which we have referred in pars [178]-[180], and the failure to disclose the information report of 23 December 2004, to which we have referred in par [181], demonstrate the impropriety of the relationship. Further, the evidence showed that this occurred at a time when the appellant was in a precarious financial position, had borrowed from an associate, not disclosing the borrowing to the Commission, and had urged that associate not to disclose the borrowing. This undisclosed financial position provided a motive for the appellant to enter into the arrangements the subject of the charge.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the NSWCC evidence was tendency evidence. However, in the trial, no reliance was placed on Pt 3.6 of the Evidence Act in support of the proposition that the evidence should not be admitted. It was correct not to place reliance on these provisions. The evidence, in our view, was admissible to establish the relationship between Kinch and the appellant prior to the period in question as, for the reasons we have given, it bore directly on the probability of the appellant entering into the conspiracy: Wilson v R [1970] HCA 32; 123 CLR 334 at 339; Harriman v The Queen [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590 at 594 (although these cases predated the Evidence Act, the passages cited remain applicable); R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82 at [38].
	
	
	It remains to be considered whether the judge erred in declining to reject the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In dealing with s 137, it is important to bear in mind that what is required is the identification of the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Evidence is not prejudicial merely because it tends to establish the Crown case: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [91] citing R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139. As Gleeson CJ pointed out in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [22], “prejudice does not arise simply from the tendency of the admissible evidence to inculpate the accused”. His Honour emphasised the need for unfair prejudice, stating (at [22]):
	


“[22] ... But prejudice does not arise simply from the tendency of admissible evidence to inculpate an accused. It is unfair prejudice that is in question. Where evidence is relevant and of some probative value, prejudice might arise because of a danger that a jury may use the evidence in some manner that goes beyond the probative value it may properly be given. If there is relevant prejudice of that kind, it lies in the risk of improper use of the evidence, not in the inculpatory consequences of its proper use. If it were otherwise, probative value would itself be prejudice. All admissible evidence which supports a prosecution case is prejudicial to an accused in a colloquial sense; but that is not the sense in which the term is used in the context of admissibility.” [internal citations omitted]


	
	In the same case, at [51], McHugh J pointed out that evidence “is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task”.
	
	
	In dealing with the NSWCC evidence as a whole, consistent with the appellant’s submissions, in our opinion, the evidence had a high probative value, demonstrating both an improper relationship with Kinch, concealed from the Commission, coupled with a motive to embark on the conspiracy. The evidence of the relationship casts doubt on the proposition that the subsequent relationship was innocent and lends support to the conclusion that the subsequent conspiracy was entered into.
	
	
	As we indicated, the appellant submitted that the material would have reinforced adverse views about the appellant, stating that the evidence was likely to have “overwhelmed the jury”. In that context, the appellant referred to the decision of the High Court in Patel v R [2012] HCA 29; 247 CLR 531. In that case, the plurality held (at [112]-[113]) that there had been a miscarriage of justice, as following the narrowing of the Crown’s case, evidence which was highly prejudicial to the accused, much of which was irrelevant, was left to the jury. The miscarriage identified was that had the case been conducted on the narrower basis from the outset, irrelevant material would have been excluded and some of the material that remained relevant may have been excluded. In the present case, as we indicated, the evidence remained relevant throughout the trial and had significant probative value.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial because of the impact that it would have had on the length of the trial. However, a review of the transcript does not demonstrate that the proceedings were significantly lengthened by the admission of the evidence.
	
	
	The appellant also relied on what he described as “the nature of the records” and the fact that they were “incomplete”. However, the fact that there might have been other records which put what was tendered into context does not mean that the admitted material gave rise to a danger of unfair prejudice which outweighed its probative value. To the extent that such records were available, they could have been tendered at the trial. The appellant did not identify the material that was allegedly not available or why its absence could not have been dealt with in cross-examination. Further, the jury were told in the summing-up that they should take into account that the NSWCC records were not complete.
	
	
	The appellant made specific submissions in relation to the trial judge allowing evidence of representations made by the appellant to the NSWODPP about Kinch to go to the jury. The appellant pointed to the report of 23 May 2003 to the DPP regarding Kinch, attached to a NSWCC letter. It was submitted that although the Crown asserted that this evidence was unduly favourable to the appellant, the primary judge ultimately included in his remarks on sentence that he was not in a position to make a finding that the letter was improper: R v Standen [2011] NSWSC 1422 (Remarks on Sentence) at [35]-[36]. The fact that this was the conclusion of the trial judge at the conclusion of the trial does not mean that he erred in admitting the evidence.
	
	
	In relation to the admission of the letter of 28 November 2003 (Document 36, see pars [298]-[301] above), which the Crown alleged had misled the NSW DPP about the lawfulness of the controlled operation, the letter was admitted expressly on the basis that it contained no misrepresentation of the advice given by the Cth DPP.
	
	
	The third specific complaint involved the identification of the location of certain documents following their admission (see par [316] above). The true position was drawn to the attention of the trial judge and it has not been suggested how the danger of unfair prejudice arose in those circumstances.
	
	
	No other specific submissions were made in relation to the balance of the 11 documents the subject of the trial judge’s rulings.
	
	
	Finally, any possible misuse of the material could have been corrected by directions to the jury. The appellant abandoned the ground of appeal relating to directions to the jury on this issue.
	
	
	In these circumstances, Ground 1(i) has not been made out.
	


Ground 1(ii)

The evidence relating to acetone


	
	The appellant submitted that the evidence concerning the possession of acetone by Jalalaty was remote in time and in circumstance from what was described as the “Crown case theory”. He submitted that there was no direct evidence that he was in any way involved in the control of the acetone or in the decision to sell it. In these circumstances, he submitted that the evidence should not have been admitted as it had “little probative value but extremely high prejudicial value”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the purchase of acetone by Jalalaty could only be described as “a frolic of Jalalaty’s own”, rather than an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. He submitted that in those circumstances, the admission of the evidence was a diversion and a highly prejudicial one, whatever it may have indicated about Jalalaty’s state of mind.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that care had to be taken not to allow the effect of the evidence relating to acetone to undermine the appellant’s credibility, particularly having regard to the lack of evidence involving him in the sale. He submitted that “The presence of the acetone supported the proposition that Jalalaty could have been obtaining the acetone for potential use to manufacture MDMA, and that allows one to infer that it was pseudoephedrine that was to come in”. However, he pointed to the fact that the evidence was that MDMA was not made from pseudoephedrine, in the sense that pseudoephedrine was not a precursor for MDMA. He submitted, referring to the Crown’s written submissions, that it was not enough to just point to some form of joint criminal enterprise coupled with a general intent to import illegal substances.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was relevant to establish the appellant’s awareness, first, that the subject matter of the conspiracy was a precursor and second, the true nature of the relationship between the appellant and his alleged co-conspirators.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no unfair prejudice had been identified and no objection was taken to its relevance. In that context, the Crown cited what was said by the trial judge in his reasons for refusing a directed verdict: R (Commonwealth) v Mark William Standen [2011] NSWSC 1046 (Standen Directed Verdict Judgment) at [19]-[20]:
	


“[19]   In an email from Mr Jalalaty to the accused on 24 September 2006, Mr Jalalaty asked, ‘What does he want me to do with the drums? It is no problem to store them and keep them until they need them’. It would be open to the jury to infer that the person referred to as 'he' was Mr Kinch and that the persons referred to as ‘they’ were persons intending to use the acetone.

[20]   Mr Heagney, a forensic scientist, gave evidence that a use of acetone is as a solvent added to methylamphetamine in an oil form (manufactured from pseudoephedrine). Accordingly, the evidence about acetone is some evidence which might be capable of establishing that the accused and Mr Jalalaty believed that some persons ('they') intended to use some of the border controlled precursor to manufacture a controlled drug.”


	
	The Crown also pointed to the evidence of Mr Stevenson, to which we have referred in par [214] above. The Crown also referred to an intercepted telephone call of 21 November 2007, in which Jalalaty stated that he had bought the acetone for $8,000 and was willing to sell it for $5,000, because, “I just want it out of there because if someone finds it there how would I explain myself?”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the appellant was aware in September 2006 that Jalalaty was storing a large quantity of acetone on behalf of Kinch and was involved in communications as to what should be done with it. It was submitted that the “evidence was capable of supporting an inference that the subject matter of the importation was a precursor chemical and that this was known by the appellant, BJ [Jalalaty] and JK [Kinch]”.
	
	
	In addition, the Crown submitted that the evidence was relevant to the true nature of the relationship between the alleged conspirators. It submitted that the appellant’s knowledge that Jalalaty stored acetone on behalf of Kinch, a person known by the appellant to have a criminal past, was relevant to the true nature of the conspiracy.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown stated that the point of the evidence was that Jalalaty asked the appellant what Kinch wanted done with the acetone. He pointed to the appellant’s evidence that it was all connected with a person named Doyle and that Jalalaty had bought the acetone by mistake thinking that the appellant had wanted him to do so (see pars [246]-[247] above). He described that evidence as extraordinary.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence in relation to the acetone could not realistically be described as remote in time from the alleged conspiracy, as submitted by the appellant.
	
	
	The acetone was stored at Jalalaty’s warehouse from at least 24 September 2006. This was apparent from Jalalaty’s email to the appellant of 24 September 2006 in which Jalalaty asked, “What does he want me to do with the drums. It is no problem to store them and keep them until they need them”.
	
	
	We have referred above to the intercepted conversations of 21 November 2007 concerning the disposal of the acetone (see par [71]) and to the evidence of Mr Stevenson to the effect that Jalalaty told him that it could be used to manufacture ecstasy.
	
	
	The evidence demonstrated that the appellant knew that Jalalaty was storing the acetone on behalf of someone else and that it could be stored until it was used.
	
	
	In our opinion, it could be inferred from the evidence and the other intercepted conversations between the appellant and Jalalaty that the acetone was held on behalf of Kinch, to be used by someone in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. As we indicated, the appellant knew that it was stored “until they need them”. This evidence, as the trial judge pointed out, supports an inference that Jalalaty and the appellant were involved in an arrangement to import a substance to be used in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The appellant did not dispute the relevance of the evidence. However, he submitted that the position could be described as Jalalaty embarking on a frolic of his own and the evidence was a highly prejudicial diversion. This submission ignores the email from Jalalaty to the appellant asking what he wanted done with the drums.
	
	
	The appellant’s reliance on the fact that, while acetone could be used in the manufacture of MDMA, pseudoephedrine was not a precursor for MDMA, does not seem to us to render the evidence highly prejudicial. The evidence tendered did support the inference that what was intended to be imported was something which could be used in the manufacture of a prohibited drug and that the appellant, Kinch and Jalalaty were involved. The fact that it was subsequently proved that pseudoephedrine was not used in the manufacture of MDMA may have lessened the effect of the inference which could be drawn, but that did not make the evidence unfairly prejudicial.
	
	
	Although the Crown made some reference to what was described as the appellant’s implausible explanation for the presence of the acetone (see pars [246] and [247] above), that does not seem to us to be of relevance in dealing with the admissibility of the evidence tendered by the Crown. Nevertheless, for the reasons we have given, the evidence was properly admitted.
	
	
	It follows that this ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 1(iii)

Evidence relating to the drug MDMA


	
	The appellant, in his written submissions, identified three items of evidence concerning MDMA:
	


(a) it was the drug that Kinch and “Dutch Exporters” were involved with in 2003;

(b) expert evidence from Federal Agent Heagney … that MDMA is not made from pseudoephedrine, and that acetone might be used in the manufacture of MDMA;

(c) Kinch informed the appellant that he believed that a drug, possibly MDMA, was being imported to Australia hidden amongst bath salts.


	
	The appellant submitted that “In light of the scientific evidence that pseudoephedrine is not a precursor for MDMA it was not open to the Crown to assert that MDMA was a relevant controlled drug for the purposes of Count 1”. He submitted that the Crown wrongly persisted in this submission in submissions to the jury, repeating that the Crown’s reasoning in these submissions was suggestive of a case based on joint criminal enterprise coupled with some general intent to import illegal substances.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence in point (a), regarding the trafficking of MDMA by Kinch and the Dutch syndicate in 2003, was relevant to prove the appellant’s knowledge that Kinch was “a major international drug trafficker and money launderer”. It was pointed out that the appellant conceded the relevance of the evidence going to Kinch’s criminal history.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the evidence in point (b), of Mr Heagney, was adduced by the appellant’s counsel.
	
	
	In regard to point (c), the Crown also pointed to the fact that the appellant sought information from Kinch regarding the importation in the bath salts on his normal email and then used it as a pretext to call Mr Mercer from Customs asking whether it was “all quiet in the western front” (see par [114] above). It was submitted that “This was a calculated attempt by the appellant to determine whether the illegal consignment had been detected”. It was submitted that this evidence was directly relevant to prove the appellant’s involvement in the conspiracy.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no unfair prejudice had been identified by the appellant.
	


Consideration


	
	This ground can be dealt with shortly.
	
	
	The first item of evidence complained of was relevant, at the very least, to show the involvement of Kinch in a drug importation in 2003. The evidence identified (Exhibit 37) comprised the whole of the schedule annexed to the judgment. We have already indicated why the trial judge was correct in admitting that material.
	
	
	The second item of evidence was adduced by the appellant’s counsel in cross-examination. In these circumstances, the evidence could not be said to be unfairly prejudicial. We have dealt with the acetone issue otherwise in dealing with Ground 1(ii).
	
	
	The relevance of the third issue was that, on the Crown case, it provided a pretext for the appellant calling Mr Mercer from Customs. It is clear that it did provide the pretext for the call to Mr Mercer which took place on 12 May 2008 (see par [114] above). As the Crown pointed out, in that call, the appellant asked Mr Mercer whether it was “all quiet in the western front”. The call took place at a time when the second consignment had arrived in Sydney.
	
	
	It was open to the jury to infer that the call made by the appellant to Mr Mercer was made in order to ascertain whether the illegal substance in the shipment had been detected and the statement that a drug from China was hidden in bath salts provided a pretext for that call. Thus, the evidence strongly points to the involvement of the appellant in the conspiracy. There seems to be no unfair prejudice in its admission.
	
	
	The material was also relevant to Count 3. It provided evidence of conduct which a jury could infer was an act in furtherance of the conspiracy to avoid prosecution for the importation of an illegal substance.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, no unfair prejudice was identified. The evidence was prejudicial only by reason of its probative value. As we have indicated, that is not a basis for the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The appellant was critical of the use made of this evidence by the Crown and the Crown’s submissions to the jury. However, these matters are not the subject of a ground of appeal.
	
	
	It follows that this ground is not made out.
	


Ground 1(iv)

Evidence of lies by the appellant


	
	The evidence complained of is evidence that the appellant did not tell RAMS about his loan from Mr Newton and he requested Mr Newton not to tell the NSWCC about that same loan.
	
	
	The trial judge gave the following reasons for admitting the evidence in R (Commonwealth) v Mark William Standen [2011] NSWSC 1043:
	


“[5]   It seems to me that the evidence is relevant as evidence relating to the accused's true financial position and therefore to his motivation.

[6]   The evidence could also be regarded by the jury, if it is accepted, as showing a desire on the part of the accused to conceal from his employer his true financial position and, in particular, a desire to conceal from his employer the Crime Commission that he had accepted a loan of a substantial sum of money from a fellow employee. If this information had been disclosed to the Crime Commission, it is likely that the accused and his affairs would have been subjected to close scrutiny by the Crime Commission. It would be open to the jury to infer that the accused wished to avoid such a close scrutiny because of the fear that it might uncover matters which the accused wish to keep concealed from his employer and, in particular, the accused's participation in a conspiracy of the kind alleged by the Crown, which on the Crown case was already on foot.

[7]   I consider that the evidence has probative value of some force. I accept that the evidence has some prejudicial effect in that it shows the accused inducing a fellow employee to make a false declaration to their common employer. Nevertheless, I do not consider that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and I would not exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act. I would not exercise the discretion under s 135 to refuse to admit the evidence.”


	
	The appellant submitted that although it was open to the Crown to lead evidence of motive, in order to indicate the appellant’s financial position, evidence of lies was unnecessary to achieve that end. He submitted that the admission of evidence of “irrelevant ‘lies’ … caused irretrievable prejudice to his case”, particularly in circumstances where his credibility was critical to his defence.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the fact that “NSWCC employees were required periodically to complete financial declarations disclosing assets and liabilities”. It was submitted that the reasoning of the trial judge in admitting the evidence was correct.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was relevant to challenge the appellant’s evidence that Jalalaty “made or promised payments to the appellant out of a ‘moral obligation’” arising out of “unfulfilled promises to the appellant”. The Crown submitted that the evidence showed that the appellant was prepared to engage in “dishonest financial conduct” in the expectation of a windfall, which “was directly relevant to proof of his participation in the illegal enterprise”.
	
	
	At the hearing, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the concealment of the appellant’s financial position was important, because if it was exposed, it would have led to an investigation and the proposal the subject of the conspiracy would have fallen apart.
	
	
	Senior counsel also submitted that the nature of the relationship between the appellant and Kinch was of central importance at the trial. It submitted it was the prosecution case that the relationship became improper sometime after Kinch’s arrest in 2003 and the corrupt relationship formed the essential background to the formation of the conspiracy. The Crown noted that the appellant’s contention by contrast was that the relationship concerned a legitimate handler/informer relationship and developed into a friendship emanated by the joint pursuit of business opportunities.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence in question was not only relevant to the appellant’s financial position. The fact that the appellant was prepared to mislead the NSWCC and encourage Mr Newton to do so, coupled with the concealment of his dialogue with Kinch, was evidence from which the jury could infer a corrupt relationship, which made it more likely that the appellant would enter into the conspiracy alleged by the Crown. The non-disclosure was important because any disclosure of the actual position may well have led to an investigation, which would have uncovered the appellant’s improper relationship with Kinch.
	
	
	The evidence had some prejudicial effect, as the trial judge pointed out in the passage from his judgment to which we have referred in par [379] above. However, having regard to the nature of the evidence, the danger of any unfair prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3


	
	In considering this ground, it is necessary to have regard to the provisions of s 11.5 and s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	Section 11.5, so far as relevant, provides as follows:
	


“11.5(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed.

(2)   For the person to be guilty:

(a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and

(b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and

(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.”

Section 307.11(1) is in the following terms:

“307.11   Importing and exporting commercial quantities of border controlled precursors

(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person imports or exports a substance; and

(b) either or both of the following apply:

(i) the person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug;

(ii) the person believes that another person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and

(c) the substance is a border controlled precursor; and

(d) the quantity imported is a commercial quantity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.”


	
	Ground 3, as originally formulated, was that the trial judge erred in refusing an application for a directed verdict of acquittal on Count 1. It was submitted that the judge fell into error in two respects. First, the trial judge misdirected himself as to the elements of Count 1, in that he failed to consider the fact that at least two persons said to be party to the conspiracy had to have held the requisite belief in s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code during the course of the agreement and at the same time. The second basis was that there was no evidence on which the jury could reach the conclusion that they did.
	
	
	In rejecting the application for a directed verdict, the trial judge made the following remarks in the Standen Directed Verdict Judgment:
	


“[6]   In the indictment the Crown alleged both sub-paragraphs of paragraph (b). However, in submissions on this application the Crown relied only on sub-paragraph (ii). In its submissions the Crown stated the element of the offence, when section 11.5 of the Code was combined with section 307.11(1)(b)(ii) as being that:

‘The accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed the substance would be used to manufacture a controlled drug by some other person or persons.’

…

[8]   I accept counsel for the accused's submission about the proper interpretation of sub-paragraph (b)(ii). Under sub-paragraph (b)(ii), as read with section 11.5 of the Code, the Crown has to prove that the accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed that another person intended to use at least some part of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug. However, I do not consider that it is necessary for the Crown to precisely identify who the other person was.

…

[12]   In my opinion, as was submitted by the Crown, there is evidence capable of establishing sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of section 307.11(1). This evidence includes part of a conversation between the accused and Mr Jalalaty on 21 May 2008 recorded by a listening device. This passage is as follows:

BJ: but the thing it's not a finished product twenty (indistinct)

MS: oh

BJ: yeah twenty three

MS: ah no so these are like chemicals and things like um crystal

BJ: yeah looks like rice

MS: okay

BJ: the product itself won't do anything to anyone like you opened it won't do anything when you mix it with something else then it becomes something else

MS: they're making something whatever we don't know

BJ: yeah they've, they've made it my warehouse the guy was there but he finished before they make it we get paid and I will make sure that I remove the bags transfer it into a plain brown box tape them up and hand them over to my Portuguese mate and I get them back and I burn them so there is no trace of that bag wants me to said I said look I'd rather do that cause they know I'm in control

MS: mm then his bald mate must be close

[13]   In this passage the accused referred to 'they' as making something and Mr Jalalaty said ""they've made it at my warehouse"" and Mr Jalalaty referred to 'the guy' being there and to his 'Portuguese mate', who had previously been mentioned in conversations.

[14]   The evidence also includes part of the conversation between the accused and Mr Jalalaty on 25 October 2007 recorded by a listening device, as follows:

BJ: so that means you know and when it when it comes I'm not even gonna my boys will be unloading it as per normal

MS: yep

BJ: stacking it as per normal palletising it as per normal and how they pick it up is not my problem

MS: yep ok (Indistinct)

[15]   The statement by Mr Jalalaty 'how they pick it up' is capable of referring to the persons who intend to use the border controlled precursor. The emphasis by Mr Jalalaty that the goods are to be unloaded and stacked 'as per normal' is capable of implying that the goods in question were not normal products.

[16]   The evidence also includes part of the conversation between the accused and Mr Jalalaty on 23 November 2007 recorded by a listening device, as follows:

MS: and then when you get it

BJ: yep

MS: who comes to you

BJ: no-one I pick it up

MS: No the next one

BJ: oh the baldy guy my Portuguese mate

MS: only him

BJ: only him he comes and picks up those thirty bags take three back to him to empty bags and I destroy the bags so the bags aren't out there

[17]   In this passage Mr Jalalaty referred to 'my Portuguese mate', 'the baldy guy', picking up the bags.


	
	As we have indicated, the challenge to the judgment declining to direct a verdict on Count 1 was abandoned and leave was sought to reformulate Ground 3. Directions were given for written submissions both on the grant of leave and the substantive ground.
	
	
	The Ground 3, as re-formulated, was in the following terms:
	


“There was a miscarriage of justice arising from the failure of the jury to be directed that it was a necessary requirement for a finding of guilt on Count 1: (i) that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the same time, during the currency of the conspiracy alleged in that Count, the applicant/appellant and at least one other party to that conspiracy believed that another person, at that time, intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and (ii) that the jury had to be so satisfied of the applicant’s/appellant’s actual belief rather than of any other mental state as to that intention and that the failures to so direct were errors of law.”


	
	The trial judge gave the following written directions in relation to Count 1:
	


“Count 1 – elements – (matters to be proved)

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that :-

1. Between 1 January 2006 and 2 June 2008 the accused entered into an agreement with one or more other persons.

2. The accused and at least one other party to the agreement intended that pursuant to the agreement :-

(i) A substance would be imported.

(ii) The substance to be imported would be a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine.

3. The accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug.

4. The accused and at least one other person intended, that is meant, to enter into an agreement as alleged in 1 and 2.

5. The agreement related to a commercial quantity.

6. The accused or at least one other party to the agreement committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.”


	
	In his summing-up, his Honour made the following remarks on the elements of the offence:
	


“Element 1. The Crown has to prove that an agreement was entered into at some time within the period alleged. It is not necessary for the Crown to prove the agreement was entered into at any particular time within that period. It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that all parties to the agreement entered into the agreement at the same time. Parties to the agreement could have entered into the agreement at different times.

The Crown has to prove that the accused entered into an agreement with one or more other persons, that is with at least one other person. The entering into the agreement is the gist or the nub of the offence charged.

…

Element 2 is that the accused and at least one other party to the agreement intended that, pursuant to the agreement, a substance would be imported; the substance to be imported would be a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine.

…

Element 3 refers to the accused and at least one other party to the agreement. The Crown has to prove that the accused had the belief alleged in element 3. The Crown also has to prove that at least one other person who the Crown has already proved entered into the agreement in accordance with element 1 and who the Crown has proved had the intentions alleged in element 2, that same person had the belief alleged in element 3. So that at least one other person was a party to the agreement, intended that pursuant to the agreement a substance would be imported and it would be pseudoephedrine and had the belief alleged in element 3. There has to be at least one other person who satisfies all of those elements.

…

In element 3 you will see the word ‘any’. The accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed that another person intended to use ‘any’ of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed that another person intended to use any of the substance, that is any part of the substance, for the purpose stated.

…

It is therefore necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused and at least one other party to the agreement believed another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture methylamphetamine or methamphe",2015-08-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702968,R v Bloomfield [2015] NSWDC 176,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Some of the most common offences that courts deal with these days are offences of breaking and entering and stealing so that money can be obtained to fund drug addiction. Addicts need to spend a great deal of money to satisfy their addiction and so almost invariably they resort to crime. In this case Mr Bloomfield, although apparently in the past demonstrating some ability to stay off the drugs and thus stay out of trouble, recommenced substantial drug use and committed a significant number of offences as a result.
	
	
	There are two offences for which I must sentence him. To each of those is attached a Form 1 covering further offences. The first offence is an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, in this case stealing. The offender jumped over a front veranda wall of some premises in Hamilton and opened a closed but unlocked sliding door whilst people were asleep in the premises. He took some passports, two wallets, a Mastercard and a house key. He then left the way he came. The maximum penalty for an offence of that kind is 20 years imprisonment. It carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years. In deciding the sentence for that offence I have taken into account both the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty in deciding the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period do appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	After taking the property from those premises the offender committed a number of crimes which appear on the Form 1 attached to that offence. Using cards taken from the premises he obtained property by deception on three occasions, making purchases of $124.57, $120.40 and $30.
	
	
	A few days after committing that offence he committed another one of a similar kind. This time, because he went through a door which was left ajar, he did not break into the premises. On this occasion he committed an offence of aggravated enter with intent to steal. Once again people were asleep inside when the offender entered the premises through a rear open sliding door. He took two handbags hanging by the kitchen bench as well as a watch, a credit card holder and some personal cards. Later that same day he committed a number of other crimes appearing on the Form 1 attached to that offence. He obtained property by deception using one of the cards that he had taken and then entered into secured areas at Ravenshaw Street, The Junction. In one of those he entered a car and stole an iPod, satnav, GPS and some coins.
	
	
	When he was arrested on 12 January he was found to be in possession of not only items linked to the offences I have described but also a small amount of cannabis. The possession of that drug also appears on the second Form 1.
	
	
	The offender is 38 years of age. He is of Aboriginal Australian heritage. He was brought up on an Aboriginal mission near Taree. He told a psychologist that this was a negative area in which to grow up because of excessive alcohol and violence perpetrated by other individuals who lived on the mission. The offender was raised in the context of antisocial behaviours and individuals.
	
	
	His home life was chaotic. His mother was an alcoholic and his stepfather was violent and so at 15 years of age he decided to leave the family environment. He went to Sydney. He lived on the streets in Newtown for a few years in the company of his maternal aunt, returned briefly to Taree to try and complete his schooling, but was unsuccessful and so went back to Sydney. At one point he and his aunt obtained a Department of Housing home but soon after that Mr Bloomfield began to be sentenced to periods of custody. A cycle of offending, custody, release, offending, custody and release has then developed.
	
	
	It has to be said that not everyone has the same advantages in growing up. The choices that individuals make as they develop are clearly influenced by the choices of others around them. People who are brought up in law-abiding households find themselves in an environment where good behaviour is modelled. Unfortunately for the offender, he was brought up in an environment which modelled aggression, excessive use of alcohol, and crime. Mr Bloomfield’s decision to begin to use drugs and then to commit numerous offences to support his habit has to be looked at in the context of his sad and much less than ideal upbringing.
	
	
	A psychological report tendered on Mr Bloomfield’s behalf explains his drug taking history and the circumstances in which, having been doing relatively well for some time on a Drug Court program, he relapsed to the stage where he was using methylamphetamine daily for the few weeks before committing these offences.
	
	
	It is apparent that custody really holds no fears for the offender. If he is not yet institutionalised he soon will be. That is a terribly sad thing to say about a 38 year old man. He will, I expect, eventually reach the age where he looks back on his life with a great deal of regret. Through spending a great deal of his adult life in custody he has missed out on many of the things which freedom brings.
	
	
	However, it is my duty to sentence him when he commits criminal offences and other judges in my position will continue to send him to gaol when he offends as he has on this occasion. It is a very serious matter to break into someone’s home when they are inside or enter through a door which is ajar. Not only do people suffer a financial loss but the victims of such offences almost invariably feel more apprehension when they are at home. Items of sentimental value are often taken and the effects of offences such as these extend far beyond the individual householders. Insurance premiums go up. There is additional security required on houses and so there is rightfully a great deal of community concern with offences of this type. That concern was reflected firstly by the guideline judgment of R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327and secondly by the selection of break, enter and steal as one of those offences which carries with it a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I impose upon him will be 25% less than they would otherwise have been. I will backdate the sentence I am about to impose to 24 March 2015. I have done this because whilst the offender has been in custody for a longer period, for some of that time he was serving sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	I have applied the principle of totality in the selection of the aggregate sentence I will shortly announce and of course in the selection of the indicative sentences which underlie that aggregate sentence.
	
	
	There are clearly special circumstances in this case. Although I could not say that the prospects of Mr Bloomfield rehabilitating are good, it is in his interests and perhaps more importantly in the community’s interest that he be given as much assistance as possible to break the cycle of offending and custody, offending and custody.
	
	
	Were it not for the circumstance that I am imposing an aggregate sentence, I would have sentenced Mr Bloomfield as follows. For the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of four years with a non-parole period of two and a half years.
	
	
	For the offence of aggravated enter dwelling with intent to steal I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of three years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of three years to date from 24 March 2015 and a head sentence of six years, thus the non-parole period will expire on 23 March 2018 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

2702969,R (Cth) v Yuan [2015] NSWCCA 198,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 18 February 2014 the respondent was convicted after a trial in the Sydney District Court of one charge pursuant to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) – import commercial quantity of border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000.


	
	The amount of methamphetamine involved in the importation was 68.845 kilograms with a purity of 79.9%. The pure weight of the methamphetamine was 54.961 kilograms. The potential wholesale value of the methamphetamine was between $13,768,920 and $17,211,150. Its retail value was between $48,191,220 and $55,075,680.
	
	
	On 21 November 2014 McClintock SC DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing 20 September 2012 and expiring 19 September 2018, with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 19 September 2022.
	
	
	The Crown brings this appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Crown relies upon a single ground of appeal.
	


That the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.

Factual background


	
	Although the matter ran to trial, an Agreed Statement of Facts was provided by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. His Honour also had available to him a schedule of comparative cases, a pre-sentence report, Crown submissions on sentence and the remarks on sentence of Flannery SC DCJ in relation to a co-offender, Vin H Doan (“Doan”).
	
	
	The respondent was born in July 1983 in Hong Kong and his parents still reside there. He came to Australia in 2000 on a student visa and completed a diploma in business and marketing in 2004. Thereafter, he began working as a migration consultant for a few years, before working in a friend’s furniture business. The respondent established his own furniture importing business in 2010 and was operating this business until he was arrested.
	
	
	On 8 May 2012 the respondent departed Australia for Hong Kong. On 27 May 2012 another co-offender, Tin Chu Gary Hui (“Hui”), arrived in Sydney from Hong Kong. On 18 June 2012 the respondent arrived back in Australia from Hong Kong and on 25 June 2012 signed Hui into the Star Casino as his guest. Later that day, Hui departed for Hong Kong. On 17 July 2012 the respondent used a mobile phone with a number ending in 188, which had been acquired in the name of “Greg Turner”.
	
	
	On 16 August 2012 Hui returned to Sydney from Hong Kong. On about 28 August 2012 a container with a number ending in 225 left China. RH Freight, based in Botany, was engaged as a freight forwarder for the consignment by a Chinese company. RH Freight’s job was to arrange customs and AQIS clearances. Paperwork for the consignment listed the consignee as “Jack Goden” with a mobile telephone number ending in 188 (i.e. the phone mentioned earlier). The contents of the container were listed as 47 cartons “outdoor dining set, leather sofa, fabric sofa”.
	
	
	On 1 September 2012 a man calling himself “Jack” attended the premises of Storage King at Princes Highway Rockdale. “Jack” was the respondent. He inquired about renting a storage unit that would fit the contents of a 20 foot shipping container and was told that such a unit was available. He reserved a suitable unit (AA03) and subsequently rang to ask about security. On 11 September 2012 the container arrived at Port Botany. The consignment note identified the contact person as “Jack Goden” and the point of delivery as Storage King Rockdale.
	
	
	On 12 September 2012 the container was examined by Customs officers. The consignment consisted of furniture, including five high-backed sofas inside which Customs officers located packages containing a substance which when tested, was positive for methamphetamine. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) were contacted and the consignment was seized. The sofas contained 69 packages, 68 wrapped in carbon paper and one in clear plastic. When the content of these packages was analysed, it was found to contain 68.845 kgs of methamphetamine, the pure weight of which was 54.961 kgs, i.e. there was an average purity of 79.9%.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012 the AFP substituted the consignment with an inert substance and the container was repacked. On that same day, the respondent called a male in China who identified himself as “Sam”. Sam advised the respondent that the container could not be delivered the next day because it had only just passed Customs. Sam said the truck could not be arranged until the container passed the Customs “scan”. The respondent suggested that once the delivery was finalised, they should improve the process for next time. There was also a discussion in which the respondent agreed to transfer money to Sam in China.
	
	
	On 14 September 2012 the respondent contacted the freight forwarder regarding the delivery of the consignment at 9am on Tuesday 18 September 2012. He asked whether there had been any problems with the clearance of the container. On the same day, the AFP were authorised to perform a controlled delivery of the container and a surveillance device was installed in unit AA03 at Storage King Rockdale.
	
	
	On Saturday 15 September the respondent attended Storage King Rockdale and informed staff that the container would arrive at 9am on Tuesday 18 September 2012. At 9.30am on that day, the substituted consignment was delivered to Storage King. An Asian man accepted delivery of the consignment, signing the delivery receipt as “Jack Goden Yuan”. At about 9.47am the respondent arrived at Storage King and assisted with unloading the contents of the container into storage unit AA03. While unloading the consignment, the respondent directed that the five high-backed sofas containing the substituted packages be separated from the rest of the consignment and placed outside unit AA03 because they were going to be collected immediately. The respondent signed the delivery paperwork as “Jack Goden Yuan”. The respondent then made two calls to an unknown male about him coming to Storage King.
	
	
	About 10.54am a white Mitsubishi pantechnicon (the white truck) arrived at Storage King. In the truck were the co-accused Doan and an unknown male. The respondent, Doan and the unknown male loaded the five high-backed sofas containing the substituted packages into the back of the truck. At 11.03am the white truck departed Storage King with Doan and the unknown male on board.
	
	
	The respondent, using the name “Jack”, then paid Storage King for the hire of storage unit AA03.
	
	
	Doan and the unknown male drove the white truck to Coventry Road Cabramatta where they parked. Doan and the unknown male then walked around the corner to John Street Cabramatta from where they departed in a taxi. The white truck, with the five sofas inside, was left unattended in Cabramatta and remained under police observation.
	
	
	At 2pm on 18 September 2012 the respondent received a call from Sam in China asking about the container. The respondent told Sam that it was “done and completed and there was no problem”. At 9.43pm on Wednesday 19 September the respondent met with two males at Yennora, one of whom was Wai-To Chan (“Chan”) who was an associate of Doan and Hui. The respondent had previously signed Chan into the Star City Casino as his guest. They then drove to Bass Hill McDonalds on the Hume Highway where a discussion took place. The respondent left at approximately 10.58pm.
	
	
	On the morning of 20 September there were various meetings at which the respondent was present when the sofas were discussed. Doan and another male drove the white truck from Cabramatta to Fairfield West. A short time later Doan, Hui and other males approached the white truck and unloaded the five sofas into the garage at 40 Quiros Avenue Fairfield West. Hui then made a number of calls in Mandarin in which he discussed the consignment and its unpacking.
	
	
	At 12.12pm on 20 September AFP officers entered the garage. Doan and Hui were the only persons present. The AFP officers observed the five sofas in the garage. The base of one of the sofas had been removed. Doan and Hui were in the garage wearing gloves and in the process of removing the substitute packages from their concealment inside the open sofa. A number of the substituted packages had already been removed.
	
	
	In total 67 packages were located, of which 62 were able to be positively identified as the substitute packages. The others were not able to be so identified because they were either covered with blue fabric or were without markings. Both Doan and Hui were arrested and a search warrant executed. The respondent was arrested at his home at 9.02pm on 20 September 2012. He declined to participate in an interview.
	
	
	The respondent’s case at trial was that he admitted each of the physical elements of the offence, but denied any knowledge of the presence of the methamphetamine within the five sofas.
	


The sentence proceedings


	
	Having reviewed the facts, his Honour set out the respondent’s subjective case. The respondent did not give evidence, but his wife did. His Honour also had available a pre-sentence report. The respondent’s wife said that they had been married since 2005 and had one daughter, although the respondent was not the biological father. She said that the respondent was not a drug user and that he had been a very good stepfather to her daughter. She remained supportive of him and attested to his previous good character.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the respondent had not received any institutional charges since his incarceration on 20 September 2012. The pre-sentence report assessed him as being at low risk of re-offending. He had no previous criminal history.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to the respondent’s role in the offending. He assessed the offence as a serious and significant criminal enterprise and that the offender had been involved in the process of the importation at a fairly early stage. His Honour noted the use of phones in a false name. His Honour found as a fact that the respondent was the point of contact for the container in Australia and rejected the proposition that the respondent had a late and peripheral involvement in the matter.
	
	
	His Honour set out a number of the activities which the respondent had carried out in order to facilitate the importation, i.e. arranging the facilities at Storage King, directing the contents of the container to that location, discussions with Sam in China concerning the dispatching of the container and the transfers of money to China. His Honour noted that the respondent was physically present when the sofas were taken away by Doan and the unknown male and that he signed the paperwork.
	
	
	His Honour found:
	


“The facts suggest that the offender had involvement in the importation over a period of time and he had liaised, as I have indicated, with the exporters from China. He appeared to have familiarity and authority in his discussions with them. His immediate role was to accept delivery of the container and act as the authorised recipient of it.” (ROS 8.7)


	
	His Honour was not able to quantify the amount of the reward which the respondent was to receive, but found that because of the respondent’s role it would have been substantial. His Honour characterised the offender’s role as that of a “supervisor or executor in the enterprise”.
	
	
	In relation to the seriousness of the offending, his Honour said:
	


“ … the offender participated for a much longer time than that of Mr Doan. I note that the quantity of the drug was a very significant quantity. It is 73 times the commercial quantity threshold. The value of the drug is also very large. In my view this is a significant and serious example of the offence contemplated by the legislature and I have already indicated the role which I attributed to the offender.” (ROS 9.1)


	
	His Honour considered that the sentence to be imposed should include a very significant element of general deterrence and that specific deterrence was also a consideration. While finding that the respondent had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour could find no evidence that the respondent was remorseful.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown acknowledged the limitations which govern a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Nevertheless, the Crown submitted that the sentence imposed in this case fell within the category of cases where this Court should intervene. The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly inadequate and created an inconsistency in sentencing standards to the extent that this Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind. The Crown noted that no aspect of double jeopardy applied to such re-sentencing with respect to Commonwealth offences (Bui v DPP (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638 at [28] – [29]).
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the principles applicable to a Crown appeal against sentence set out by Refshauge J (with whom Penfold and Lander JJ agreed) in R v TW [2011] ACTCA 25; 6 ACT LR 18 at 20 – 21 [6] which was subsequently followed in R v Craig Meyboom [2012] ACTCA 48 (Refshauge Penfold and North JJ) at [6] – [9]. By reference to those decisions, the Crown identified the following as occasions which would give rise to the bringing of a Crown appeal:
	



	
	When a sentence revealed such manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards as to constitute an error in principle.
	
	
	Where it was necessary for a Court of Criminal Appeal to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing a convicted person.
	
	
	To enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime.
	
	
	To enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crimes to be corrected.
	
	
	To correct a sentence which was so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience; and
	
	
	To ensure, as far as the subject matter permits, that there would be uniformity of sentencing.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the statement of principle in those cases was consistent with what the plurality (French CJ Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]:
	


“The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"".”


	
	The Crown submitted that this Court should intervene in the circumstances of this case because:
	


“(a)   There is a need to establish matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”: Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293.

(b)   Taking into account all the relevant matters, the sentence does not reflect the circumstances of the particular offence committed by the respondent and “constitutes an affront to community standards” (R v Gallagher [1991] 23 NSWLR 220 at 232).”


	
	The Crown noted that in the sentencing hearing a schedule of cases and sentencing statistics were provided to the sentencing judge. While acknowledging the limitations of such material, the Crown submitted that by reference to it, in particular the schedule of cases and the maximum sentence available for the offence, and his Honour’s own findings as to the objective seriousness of the respondent’s role in the importation, it was clear that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. The Crown submitted that it was readily apparent that the sentence imposed was not within the proper range for this kind of offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that not only did his Honour make significant findings as to the role of the respondent and the seriousness of the offending, i.e. that his role was that of a “supervisor or executor in the enterprise” and that this was a “significant and very serious example of the offence contemplated by the legislature” but the respondent’s subjective case was weak. The Crown submitted that there was nothing put before his Honour which would have had the effect of significantly mitigating the respondent’s sentence in the light of those findings made by his Honour. The Crown submitted that in addition to those findings there was the purely financial motivation and that the criminality was sustained over 3-4 months and involved the telling of many lies. The Crown submitted that it was implicit in his Honour’s findings that the respondent’s criminality was carefully planned.
	
	
	The schedule of cases said by the Crown to be comparable and which were relied upon before the sentencing judge and in this Court were: R v Tam [2013] WASCSR 226; Thi Kim Phung Nguyen v R [2012] VSCA 119; Phuong Bich Nguyen v R; Phommalysack v R [2011] VSCA 32; 31 VR 673; R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 and Chan, Lo and Nguyen v Regina  [2010] NSWCCA 153.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that these cases were comparable because the role of the accused was similar and the quantity of drugs imported was large, although in no case was the quantity as large as the quantity of drugs here. The Crown noted that in each of those cases, there was a plea of guilty so that the sentences imposed in each case needed to be increased appropriately in order to assess their comparability with the sentence in this case. The Crown submitted that when the sentences were thus increased, they were all significantly higher than the sentence imposed here.
	
	
	The Crown made particular reference to the decision in R v Nguyen; R v  Pham. Two offenders were charged with the importation of 27.153 kgs of pure cocaine and 13.04 kgs of pure methamphetamine concealed inside foot spas. The offender Nguyen was aged 42, had registered a business name and had organised with an overseas company for the consignment of goods by sea. Police intercepted the consignment, found the drugs and replaced them with inert substances. The offender assisted in unloading the consignment and returned later with Pham to access the drugs from the goods. Pham was aged 32 and her role was to liaise with the overseas end of the operation about various matters, including payment for the deconstruction of the foot spas and the destination of the packages. She took the packages to the purchaser believing that they contained drugs.
	
	
	Initially Nguyen was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months. This was increased on appeal to a term of imprisonment of 18 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. In the case of Pham, she was originally sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. After a Crown appeal, that sentence was increased to imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	The respondent submitted that the limits on appellate review under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) of the exercise of the sentencing discretion were set out in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. He submitted that the Crown must identify error of one of the kinds mentioned in House v R and must further identify some sentencing principle that arises (R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [99]).
	
	
	The respondent submitted that of the two kinds of errors in House v R, the only one which could possibly be relevant here is “non-specific error”. That arises when no specific error can be identified but nevertheless the exercise of discretion is “unreasonable or plainly unjust” so as to justify the conclusion that error has occurred. The respondent submitted that to establish that a sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”, the Crown must establish that it was so low as to be “definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand” (Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306 per McHugh J.) The respondent submitted that since no wrong principle requiring correction has been identified and the basis for the appeal is an asserted inconsistency with other sentences, the observations of Simpson J in Tuala are apposite:
	


“99   In this case, as in DH; AH, no principle sought to be established was identified. It is not sufficient, in my opinion, to hypothesise that a sentence about which complaint is made might (or must) have come about as a result of the attribution of excessive weight to one consideration, or the attribution of inadequate weight to another. The Crown must identify error of one of the kinds mentioned in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 and must, further, identify some sentencing principle that arises. That has not here been done.”


	
	The respondent submitted that the Crown’s submissions are based on case law predating CMB v Attorney General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407. The respondent submitted that although a schedule of cases and sentencing statistics were provided to the sentencing judge, it was not suggested that his Honour did not have regard to them. The respondent submitted that the Crown was seeking to import a concept of legitimate range derived from statistics into a basis for a Crown appeal as though that would found a House v R error. The respondent submitted that such a process of reasoning was impermissible in this area of the law.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that Crown appeals were meant to be exceptional and that there was a long line of authority to that effect and that they should be rare and should only be brought for the purpose of establishing principle not mere “correction of error” (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen; R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326). The respondent submitted that it was not sufficient for the Crown to establish that the Court of Criminal Appeal would have imposed a more severe sentence.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that where as here the case turned on its own particular facts, and no principle was sought to be established nor range provided, the appeal should not be upheld. He submitted that the discretion of the sentencing judge would only be liable to be interfered with in a compelling case. He submitted that even if the sentence were outside the range, or otherwise unreasonable, where the case turned upon its own facts the appeal should be dismissed in the exercise of the discretion.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that although his Honour found that his role was not peripheral, he determined within the proper exercise of his function the nature of the role and its importance. The respondent submitted that his Honour did not find that there were comparable cases nor would it have been appropriate for him to do so. The respondent submitted that Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58] – [67] and [62] did not authorise or introduce a concept of comparable cases based on sentencing derived from statistics or summaries.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the suggested parallel with the schedule of cases provided by the Crown involved a false line of reasoning. The respondent submitted that in any event the sentences in the schedule of cases were not so inconsistent with that passed in this case as to point to a House v R error.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the discretion to entertain and uphold a Crown appeal was a most important matter. He submitted that although double jeopardy as a concept no longer regulated such appeals, the residual discretion, particularly having regard to the purpose of Crown appeals, was of great importance. He submitted that no submissions were made by the Crown as to why the discretion should be exercised in its favour. He submitted that there was no attempt in this case to expose and declare an error in principle or for the need to lay down a principle for the general governance and guidance of courts to make or establish a standard range or to correct an idiosyncratic view or to establish that the sentence was such as to shock the public conscience. He submitted that there was no principle in sentencing, even in Commonwealth offences, to ensure a “uniformity” of sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	As was submitted by the respondent, for the Crown to succeed in this appeal it needed to satisfy the second type of error identified in House v R. The nature of that exercise was succinctly stated by the High Court in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 CLR 259 (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel & Bell JJ):
	


“6   Section 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides that:

""The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper.""

7   It has long been established that ""[i]nadequacy of sentence, an expression not found in the Criminal Appeal Act ... is not satisfied by a mere disagreement by the Court of Appeal with the sentence actually imposed"". Rather, as pointed out in Dinsdale v The Queen, error must first be identified by the appellate court. And as was held in House v The King, an appeal against an exercise of discretion, in this case a sentencing discretion, is governed by established principles.

8   The particular principle which the Director sought to invoke in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence passed upon the present appellant was the last category of case identified in the well-known classification stated in House v The King:

""It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.""

9   The Director's allegation in his notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the sentence passed was ""manifestly inadequate"", was an allegation of this kind of error. It was not an allegation that the primary judge had acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, had mistaken the facts or had not taken into account some material consideration. If a case of specific error of any of those kinds was to be made it would have been necessary to identify the asserted error in the grounds of appeal. But as indicated at the outset, no case of specific error was alleged; the sole ground of appeal was manifest inadequacy of sentence.”


	
	The conclusion of the court in Carroll v R is also instructive:
	


“24   In deciding whether the sentence passed by the primary judge was manifestly inadequate it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider how the appellant's offending was properly to be characterised. In particular, it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to form a view different from the primary judge about where, on an objective scale of offending, the appellant's conduct stood. But in the absence of any challenge to the primary judge's findings of fact, it was not open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to evaluate the adequacy of the sentence by discarding reference to why the appellant had acted as he had, or by attributing to him the ability to foresee that his conduct could cause not just serious injury, but severe injury or the possibility of death. …”


	
	Statements to similar effect were made by the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 where their Honours said:
	


“24   … Sentencing is a discretionary judgment and there is no single correct sentence for an offender and an offence. Plainly enough the Court of Criminal Appeal disagreed with the sentence imposed by Judge Lerve and favoured a more severe sentence. The difference between the Court of Criminal Appeal's assessment of the appropriate sentence and Judge Lerve's assessment may be explained by saying that Judge Lerve gave too little weight to some factors and too much weight to other factors. However, within a range of sentences for this offence and this offender, the weight to be given to the evidence and the various, conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for Judge Lerve. The authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a sentence for that imposed by Judge Lerve was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to the appellant's subjective case. The power could only be engaged if the Court was satisfied that Judge Lerve's discretion miscarried because in the result his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards. In that event, the Court was required to consider whether the Director's appeal should nonetheless be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not decide that the sentence for the s 33(1)(b) offence was manifestly inadequate. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not consider the exercise of the residual discretion. …”


	
	In this case, there is no challenge to any of the findings of fact by the sentencing judge. The complaint by the Crown is that, having made findings which demonstrated not only the very serious nature of the offending but also the absence of mitigating factors, there was such a disconnect between those findings and the sentence imposed as to demonstrate that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried. That being so, it was the Crown’s submission that the existence of such a sentence created an inconsistency in sentencing standards to the extent that this Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was this latter consideration which gave rise to a “matter of principle”. As was said in Everett v R at [300] (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ):
	


“The reference to ""matter of principle"" in that passage must be

understood as encompassing what is necessary to avoid the kind of

manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards which

Barwick CJ saw as constituting ""error in point of principle”.

The reference is to the statement of Barwick CJ in Griffiths v R [1977[ HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at [310].


	
	One of the cases to which the sentencing judge was referred (R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238) (Johnson J with whom Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J agreed) is of particular assistance because it sets out a number of general propositions relating to drug importation offences, which emerge from the authorities:
	


“72   …

(a)    the criminality of an offender must be assessed by consideration of the involvement of the offender in the steps taken to effect the importation: R v Lee at [27];

(b)    problems may emerge when a sentencing court attempts to categorise the role of the offender in the drug enterprise, as in many cases the full nature and extent of the enterprise is unlikely to be known to the Court: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 279 [19]; R v Lee at [25];

(c)    it is the criminality involved in the importation which must be identified - the fact that another person may be characterised as the “mastermind” does not mean that a person who was responsible for managing the importation into Australia is properly described as having only a middle level of responsibility: R v Lee at [26];

(d)    although the weight of the drug imported is not the principal factor to be considered when fixing sentence, the size of the importation is a relevant factor and has increased significance when the offender is aware of the amount of drugs imported: Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen at 607-608 [64]; R v Lee at [23]-[24];

(e)    the statements by the High Court in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen do not suggest that, in an appropriate case, the amount of the drug involved in an importation is not a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, even to the extent of assessing that a particular offence is in the worst category of its type; in many cases, the only factor that would lead to a determination that one importation is worse than another would be the amount of drug involved where otherwise the circumstances of the importation were the same or very similar: R v Nguyen [2005] NSWCCA 362; 157 A Crim R 80 at 102 [110]; Sukkar v The Queen (No 2) [2008] WASCA 2; 178 A Crim R 433 at 447-448 [46];

(f)    as a matter of common sense, it should be inferred, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that a person who is importing drugs is doing so for profit: R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; 150 A Crim R 271 at 297 [104]; R v Lee at [32];

(g)    the difficulty of detecting importation offences, and the great social consequences that follow, suggest that deterrence is to be given chief weight on sentence and that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case: Wong v the Queen; Leung v The Queen at 607-608 [64];

(h)    the sentence to be imposed for a drug importation offence must signal to would-be drug traffickers that the potential financial rewards to be gained from such activities are neutralised by the risk of severe punishment: R v Chen and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at 382-383 [286]; R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at 552-553 [114];

(i)    involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must necessarily attract a significant sentence, otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served: R v Pang [1999] NSWCCA 4; 105 A Crim R 474 at 476 [6];

(j)    the prior good character of a person involved in a drug importation offence is generally to be given less weight as a mitigating factor on sentence: R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1 at [52]- [57]; R v Paliwala [2005] NSWCCA 221; 153 A Crim R 451 at 456-457 [20]- [25]; R v Lee at [14]; good character is not an unusual characteristic of persons involved in drug importation: Okafor v R [2007] NSWCCA 147 at [47]; Onuorah v R [2009] NSWCCA 238; 234 FLR 377 at [49];

(k)    where offenders are not young (Mr Nguyen was 42 years’ old and Ms Pham was 32 years’ old), the immaturity of youth cannot be claimed as a factor bearing upon their transgressions: Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim R 458 at 474 [98];

…”


	
	Those propositions can be usefully applied to the facts of this case and the findings by the sentencing judge. When this is done, it is apparent that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and that the submission to that effect by the Crown should be accepted.
	
	
	In his fact finding, his Honour recognised the objective seriousness of the offending. As set out above, while the quantity of drug involved is not decisive, it remains a very important consideration. Here the quantity of drug was 73 times the amount which constituted a commercial quantity (i.e. three-quarters kg). The maximum penalty for the importation of a commercial quantity of methamphetamine is imprisonment for life. That remains, as the High Court has made clear, an important guidepost for sentencing judges. The potential value of 54.961 kilograms of pure methamphetamine was also relevant, i.e. $13,768,920 - $17,211,150 wholesale and $48,191,220 - $55,075,680 retail.
	
	
	The devastating effects of methamphetamine, not only on its users but those who come in contact with them, is notorious. The rapidity with which addiction occurs is well known. The sudden onset of irrational rage accompanied by acts of extreme violence are common to those who use this pernicious substance. The potential damage and misery which would have been wrought on the community had the respondent’s importation been successful would have been enormous. Those matters are implicit in his Honour’s fact finding and the nature of the offending.
	
	
	There was nothing in the respondent’s subjective case which in any real way mitigated the seriousness of the offending. The fact that he had no previous offences was of only limited importance in offences of this kind because it was that very quality which enabled him to engage in the offending. His lack of previous convictions made it easier for him to avoid suspicion and arrange the importation. There were no extenuating circumstances, such as addiction or financial need. The respondent’s motivation as found by his Honour was financial gain, or to put it bluntly, personal greed. His Honour found that there was no remorse for the offending.
	
	
	The position occupied by the respondent in the importation of the methamphetamine into Australia was a pivotal one. He was the supervisor of what occurred at the Australian end. In that regard, his Honour rejected out of hand the suggestion that the respondent’s connection with the importation was peripheral. As also found by his Honour, the respondent’s involvement took place over a significant period of time, i.e. 3 – 4 months. Implicit in his Honour’s findings is that a significant amount of preparation and planning must have occurred for an importation of this size to have taken place. Also implicit in his Honour’s findings is the position of trust which the respondent must have held in the criminal group for him to have been entrusted with such a large quantity of methamphetamine.
	
	
	Although his Honour did not make such an assessment, it is clear from the factual findings that the objective seriousness of this offending was at the upper end of seriousness for offences of this kind.
	
	
	There was another basis for which the Crown relied on R v Nguyen; R v Pham. The Court not only reviewed sentencing standards in respect of large drug importations as set out in R v Lee [2007] NSWCCA 234 and Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 but reviewed for itself a schedule of national comparative drug importation cases for the period August 2007 to May 2010. That schedule updated the one referred to in R v Lee and extended beyond the class of cases referred to in R v Lee, which was restricted to intermediate appellate court and Supreme Court decisions, and included many District Court and County Court sentencing decisions as well. The updated schedule comprised 68 cases.
	
	
	Johnson J set out his conclusion in relation to the updated schedule of cases as follows:
	


“104    The gathering of sentencing decisions into a schedule, to assist both intermediate appellate courts and sentencing courts, has proved useful in a number of circumstances. The analysis contained in the decision of this Court in R v Lee identified sentences which had been imposed over a period of time for commercial drug importation offences, and has served to promote consistency where sentences for federal offences of that type are passed in a range of courts throughout the States and Territories of Australia.

105    Of course, R v Lee did not (and cannot) purport to be a guideline judgment. The fact that this Court has been provided with an updated schedule for the period 2007 to 2010, and has received submissions concerning that schedule for the purpose of determining these Crown appeals, does not translate the present judgment into a form of guideline judgment.

106    Comparable cases can be useful guides, but care remains necessary in the use of case schedules given the objective and subjective differences between cases and the need to render individual justice: R v Todoroski [2010] NSWCCA 75 at [26].

107    The submissions to this Court by reference to the updated schedule have been made in relatively general terms and it is appropriate that the Court respond in similar terms. Having considered the cases referred to in the updated schedule, I am satisfied that the schedule continues to support the analysis contained in R v Lee.

108    Of course, there are differences between offences and offenders in the cases referred to in the schedule, including quantities of drugs involved, the offender’s plea and the timing of the plea, the giving of discounts for assistance to authorities and the role of the particular offender in the various cases.

109    An examination of these cases, however, supports the Crown submission with respect to manifest inadequacy in this case, where the Respondents played senior roles, and were key organisers critical to the success of the enterprise, being large-scale importations of border controlled drugs. The position reached by reference to arguments advanced on the appeals is supported by the fact that the Respondents appear to fall within the second group of commercial quantity offenders identified by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa at [210]-[211], [224], being part of an analysis which Simpson J (at [291]-[305]) and Barr AJ (at [313]) regarded as helpful.”


	
	Applying that approach to this case, while it cannot be said that a small selection of cases which bear a strong similarity to the offending under consideration set a standard or range for sentencing, they are helpful. They provide some guide to sentencing patterns and indicate how sentencing principles have been applied in other cases where similar issues have arisen. As was said by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen concerning such cases:
	


“54   … Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"".”


	
	As stated by his Honour, for an offence of this seriousness, the sentence had to take into account a significant element of general deterrence as well as specific deterrence. The sentence needed to be such as to clearly denounce the respondent’s conduct. The sentence needed to recognise the devastating effect which the offending would have had on very many victims and on the community as a whole. The sentence imposed for this offence needed to demonstrate in the clearest terms that persons who import large commercial quantities of methamphetamine can expect to receive a lengthy custodial sentence.
	
	
	It follows that I am satisfied in this case that there was “a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance” (House v R at 505). The result embodied in the sentencing judge’s orders was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. I am satisfied that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. I am also satisfied that the existence of such a sentence creates an inconsistency in sentencing standards to the extent that this Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind.
	
	
	That, however, does not end the matter. There remains the question of whether, as a matter of discretion, this Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent.
	
	
	While being mindful that the Crown carries the onus of establishing that the discretion should not be exercised in favour of the respondent (CMB v Attorney General (NSW)) there is no discretionary consideration before the Court in this matter which would cause the Court not to proceed to re-sentence. On the contrary, the very basis for the intervention of this Court is to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind. The sentencing process at first instance led to the imposition of an unreasonable or plainly unjust sentence. The interests of justice require the imposition of an appropriate sentence for this serious offence (R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at [79]). The sentence is so inadequate that it cannot be allowed to stand.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the orders which I propose are:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.   
	
	
	The sentence imposed by the District Court on 21 November 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing 20 September 2012 and expiring 19 September 2022, with a balance of term of 5 years, expiring 19 September 2027.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	HAMILL J: I have had the great advantage of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in draft. I agree that this prosecution appeal should be upheld and that the respondent must be re-sentenced. I agree generally with the Chief Judge’s reasons and adopt his Honour’s analysis of the relevant facts, circumstances and statement of the issues. In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, I have come to a different conclusion as to the appropriate sentence largely because I take a different approach to one aspect of the respondent’s subjective case, namely the weight to be afforded to the evidence of his lack of criminal history and previous good character. I am also concerned to ensure that there is an appropriate proportion between the respondent’s sentence and that imposed on the co-offender (Doan).
	


The appeal against inadequacy must be upheld 


	
	The role of the respondent in the present case was well above that of a mere courier or recipient of the drugs and the sentencing Judge so found. However, he was not a principal in the operation and his involvement, in the sense of the things that he actually did to advance the importation, were relatively confined: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [19]. The fact that he was involved in the actual collection of the drugs suggests that he was not operating at a high level. Those at the top of such organisations do not generally expose themselves to detection in such a way. There was a massive amount of drugs involved and nothing to suggest that the respondent was not aware of that fact: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [64] and [69]. The sentencing Judge inferred that he was likely to receive substantial financial reward for his involvement.
	
	
	A comparison between the sentence imposed on the respondent and sentences imposed in other cases must be undertaken with considerable caution: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [53]-[55]. However, in comparing his sentence with those other sentencing outcomes, it must be remembered that the respondent was not entitled to a reduction in his sentence in consequence of any willingness on his part to facilitate the course of justice, by way of a plea of guilty, assistance to law enforcement authorities or otherwise. When the comparison is made with those considerations in mind, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the sentence imposed on the respondent was outside of an appropriate sentencing range and that “there must have been some misapplication of principle [by the sentencing judge], even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons”: Wong v the Queen at [58] Hili v The Queen at [59], [67].
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and plainly wrong. I also agree that the appellant has established, by reference to the extent of the inadequacy and the necessity to ensure some reasonable degree of consistency in sentencing for such grave offences, that the Court ought not to exercise its discretion not to intervene. Apart from onus (as to which see CMB v The Queen [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407), Queens Counsel for the applicant did not point to any feature of the case that would bear upon that decision. Indeed, unlike many inadequacy appeals, the respondent did not adduce any evidence as to his progress in custody, or the degree of actual (as opposed to presumed) anxiety occasioned by the initiation of the appeal: Bui v The Queen at 28; and, cf, R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at [141] in relation to New South Wales offences after the introduction of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	Bui v The Queen held that the Court is not to take into account “double jeopardy”, in the sense of the “presumed anxiety and distress on re-sentencing” that accompanies a Crown appeal. What is required is the imposition of a sentence that is “of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the offence”: s 16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	


Re-sentencing


	
	In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, a matter in relation to which I adopt a different approach to that of Hoeben CJ at CL concerns the relevance of the respondent’s lack of criminal history and the evidence of his previous good character. There was no dispute that he was a person with no prior convictions and there was evidence that supported the finding that he was a person of good character apart from his involvement in the present offence. His wife gave evidence of his background, studies and work history. Section 16A(1)(m) requires that those matter are to be taken into account.
	
	
	There is a body of authority that shows prior good character may be of less significance or weight where the fact of the offender’s good character and lack of antecedents enabled the person to commit the offences or made it less likely that the offending will be discovered. An example is a person whose good standing in the community facilitates their commission of sexual offences against children: Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [275] (McHugh J); R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [43]-[44]. In many of the child sexual assault cases, another factor which diminishes the role of good character is the fact the offending occurred over a number of years or involved a number of victims.
	
	
	In New South Wales, s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 prevents the court from taking into account an offender’s good character or lack of previous convictions as a mitigating factor for a child sexual offence if the court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	A similar approach has been applied to drug couriers who, it is said, are chosen because their lack of criminal history will make it less likely that they will be detected: see, for example, R v Leroy (1984) 2 NSWLR 441 at 446–447. In R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323, it was said:
	


“40. It is timely to draw attention to the following remarks of Wood CJ at CL in Smith, which remarks his Honour reaffirmed in Budiman, both those judgments of Wood CJ at CL being referred to with approval by Spigelman CJ in Behar:

‘It is time that this court reminded those who would seek to establish chains for the importation of substances such as cocaine and heroin into this country, and their potential recruits, of those remarks. [Wood CJ at CL is there referring to the remarks of Wells J in Le Cerf at 8 ALR, 351 and following.] Too often has it been the case that recruits have been selected to act as couriers and the like, upon the basis either that they are free of conviction and possess apparent attributes of respectability such that they are likely to escape detection or alternatively upon the basis that they possess personal circumstances relating to family or otherwise such that they can press a powerful argument for leniency upon subjective grounds.’”


	
	In R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1 Abadee J (with whom Sheller JA agreed) said:
	


“55    Further in Behar the Chief Justice also referred to Wood CJ at CL’s views in R v Budiman (CCA 8 September 1998, unreported):

‘Couriers and others involved in the drug trade additionally have no entitlement to expect that they will be able to rely upon their prior good character for a significant discount on sentence if they happen to be arrested’. (at 9)

56   There is a difference between a “significant discount” on the one hand, and on the other hand non allowance of any discount at all.”


	
	The authorities establish that an offender’s good character and/or lack of criminal antecedents may have less weight in a case where the fact of those qualities has been used to facilitate the commission of the offence or to avoid detection. However, I am unable to accept that this is an approach that commends itself generally to drug offences or to drug importation offences. The weight to be given to prior good character will vary, depending on the circumstances of the case. Further, in the absence of a provision such as 21A(5A) of the NSW Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the fact of an offender’s prior good character and lack of criminal record remains a matter to be taken into account. To state the obvious, such an offender must generally be entitled to expect a less severe sentence than an offender with an extensive criminal history.
	
	
	In the present case, I am unable to conclude that the respondent used his prior good character to facilitate the importation. The consignee was listed as “Jack Godden”. The respondent signed for the consignment using the name “Jack Golden Yuan”. His lack of criminal record (in his name) did not impact on the ease or otherwise of detecting the importation. The drugs were imported inside furniture and the respondent had a furniture business but this did not depend on a lack of prior convictions or on the respondent’s general good character as attested to, for example, by his wife. The prosecutor acknowledged at first instance that there was “no evidence that he’d previously imported anything at all”.
	
	
	The respondent’s good character also influenced the finding in the pre-sentence report that the offender represented a low risk of re-offending. Since arriving in Australia on a student visa in the year 2000, he has achieved a Diploma in Business and worked as a migration consultant. These achievements did not make it easier for him to commit the offence or harder for the authorities to detect it.
	
	
	It may be that the different approach that I have taken to the weight to be afforded to the respondent’s good character is the reason that I would impose a less severe sentence than that favoured by Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J.
	
	
	I have also considered it appropriate to moderate the penalty to a degree in view of the sentence imposed on the co-offender Doan. Doan was operating at a much lower level than the applicant, did not know the amount of drugs involved and received a reduction in his sentence of 25% for his plea of guilty. He received a sentence of seven years with recognizance release order of three and a half years. In spite of the manifest differences between the cases and the expectation that Doan would receive a much less severe sentence than that imposed on the respondent, it remains important to consider that sentence in determining the just sentence to be imposed on the respondent. As Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26;189 CLR 295 at 301:
	


“Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.”


	
	Synthesising all of those considerations, and keeping in mind the maximum penalty and enormous quantity of drugs involved in the present case, the sentence that I would impose on the respondent is one of 13 years with a non-parole period of 8½ years. That is a minority view and I otherwise agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2702970,Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Following pleas of guilty in the Local Court, the plaintiff, Mr Richard William Buttrose, was sentenced in the District Court by Sorby DCJ on 18 March 2010 for various drug supply and related offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal subsequently quashed his sentences ([2011] NSWCCA 35) and re-sentenced him to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months. On the most serious of the charges, supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, he was, after regard was had to Form 1 offences, sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 26 August 2009 and concluding on 25 August 2018 with a balance term of 3 years concluding on 25 August 2021. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years specified.

On 5 October 2011 the High Court delivered its judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 identifying the manner in which the standard non-parole periods specified in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) are to be taken into account in sentencing. The High Court’s decision overruled the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 which previously governed the issue in New South Wales.

Subsequently, the plaintiff applied to the Supreme Court under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into his sentences and a direction that the Court refer his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The plaintiff contended that he had been sentenced in accordance with the law stated in R v Way, which the High Court in Muldrock later found to be incorrect. On 19 June 2014, Hoeben CJ at CL refused the application on the basis that no doubt or question existed as to whether the plaintiff had been sentenced in accordance with law.

By a summons filed on 17 November 2014, the plaintiff sought a declaration in the following terms:

“Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge, and on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, such as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the plaintiff’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.”

Held (per Beazley P and Leeming JA), making the declaration sought:

(1)   The determination of the plaintiff’s application under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act was not judicial in nature but was reviewable for jurisdictional error ([4]).

Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343; 85 NSWLR 463 applied.

(2)   Fulfilment of the precondition to the making of a direction that an inquiry be conducted or a case be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal (that there be a relevant doubt or question) turns upon the satisfaction of the judge to whom the application is made, not on whether there objectively exists such a doubt or question ([16]).

Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24; 135 CLR 110 referred to.

(3)   Jurisdictional error was established because the judge did not address a substantial argument ([20]-[25]).

Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 considered.

Held (per Macfarlan JA) also favouring the grant of declaratory relief:

(1)   It is unnecessary to determine whether the jurisdictional fact specified in s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act refers to the decision-making judge’s satisfaction as to the existence of a relevant “doubt or question” or to the existence, in an objective sense, of that “doubt or question”. That is because a declaration to the effect that as a matter of objective fact there is a relevant “doubt or question” would have utility, as the plaintiff may make a further application under s 78 ([40]-[41]).

(2)   A declaration may be made where it would effectively determine a legal controversy in which the plaintiff has a real interest ([39]).

Plaintiff M61/2010E v The Commonwealth; Plaintiff M69/2010 v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 referred to.

(3)   The plaintiff established that there is a “doubt or question” as to whether the Court of Criminal Appeal’s re-sentencing of the plaintiff involved Muldrock error. As a result, declaratory relief should be granted to facilitate the plaintiff making a further application under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act ([69]-[78]).

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P and LEEMING JA:  We have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Macfarlan JA in draft, which have enabled us to express our reasons concisely.
	
	
	Richard William Buttrose pleaded guilty to drug supply offences, including supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (5.9573 kilograms of cocaine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), which offence has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. He was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years and 6 months. That sentence reflected a discount of 45% for an early plea and assistance to the authorities.
	
	
	In 2011, Mr Buttrose’s appeal against sentence was allowed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, which resentenced him to an overall term of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months: Buttrose v R [2011] NSWCCA 35. The sentence for the offence contrary to s 25(2) was 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	A Supreme Court judge has considered and refused an application made by Mr Buttrose in 2013 for an inquiry into his sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). His Honour considered the application on the papers, and refused it, giving reasons which have been given a media neutral citation: [2014] NSWSC 826. However, as the name “Application by Richard William Buttrose pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001” suggests, the refusal of Mr Buttrose’s application was not “a judgment or order of the Court in a Division”. It is established that his Honour was not exercising judicial power, nor were the proceedings judicial in nature: Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343; 85 NSWLR 463 at [2], [7] and [22]. Accordingly, no appeal lies pursuant to s 101(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). However, the determination is reviewable for jurisdictional error: Patsalis at [3], [7], and [23]-[24].
	
	
	Mr Buttrose has by summons invoked this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction, now regulated by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, in respect of the administrative function exercised by the judge. His summons is entitled “Summons (Judicial Review)” and seeks solely declaratory relief. As originally formulated, it was confined to errors of law. By supplementary submissions filed (with leave) after the hearing, he made it plain that he contended that there were errors which constituted jurisdictional error, the first two of which were as follows:
	


“(a) Failed to consider the plaintiff’s submissions by erroneously summarising their effect as merely a ‘review’ of Muldrock expressed in general terms with no direct application to the plaintiff’s case;

(b) Failed to take into account relevant material, namely the plaintiff’s submission that the principles and analysis in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 applied directly to the plaintiff’s case.”


	
	(The references to “Muldrock” above and to “Muldrock error” in the submissions are references to the imposition of a sentence which, by reason of what was determined in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, discloses material error (see for example Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 88 ALJR 490 at [2] and [7]).)
	
	
	Australian law insists upon a distinction between “want of jurisdiction” and “excess of jurisdiction”, on the one hand, and “the manner of its exercise” on the other, to use the terms employed by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7; 59 CLR 369 at 389. The joint judgment in Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Ltd [2008] HCA 32; 237 CLR 146 at [5] traces the ancestry of “jurisdictional error” to the former.
	
	
	It is sensible to deal first with Mr Buttrose’s submissions based on jurisdictional error, for these reasons. First, it is the anterior legal concept. Whether a person is authorised to decide a question precedes the issue whether the decision is attended by legal error.
	
	
	Secondly, and for that reason, jurisdictional error may be established by “any admissible evidence relevant for that purpose”: Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v Kerr [2012] NSWCA 13; 83 NSWLR 302 at [15]. In contrast, as Basten JA there noted, “the broader concept of error of law must identify the relevant error as appearing ‘on the face of the record’”.
	
	
	Thirdly, in Futuris at [4] the joint judgment identified as the “central issue” in an application invoking the jurisdiction conferred by s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) whether there had been an error in the exercise of power which amounted to jurisdictional error, as opposed to whether there had been merely error of law or fact. The same is true of Mr Buttrose’s application, invoking as it does the State counterpart jurisdiction under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, the exchange of submissions after the hearing disclosed questions as to the nature of the “record”. Mr Buttrose submitted that there was no need to identify a record, since he sought merely declaratory relief. That proposition is not one which we would necessarily accept. If Mr Buttrose’s proposition were not correct, then the question noted in QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd v Miller [2013] NSWCA 442 at [37] would arise whether s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act applied to the reasons given by the judge. That question is not free from difficulty. Not least because it was not the subject of full submissions, it is best left undecided, since, on the view we take, it need not be determined.
	
	
	We turn to the relief sought. There are difficulties concerning the granting of relief in the nature of certiorari or mandamus in a case such as this. It is sufficient to refer to what was said by Basten JA in Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783 at [63]-[76]. Mr Buttrose sought to avoid those difficulties by following the course taken in Sinkovich of seeking declaratory relief.
	
	
	Contrary to the position taken by the parties, we would not lightly conclude that merely because the relief sought is declaratory that the general provisions in Part 59 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) do not apply. That Part applies generally to “proceedings under section 65 and section 69 of the Supreme Court Act and other proceedings in the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court”: r 59.1(1)(a). Rule 59.10 provides that proceedings for judicial review must be commenced within three months of the date of the decision, and confers a power for that time period to be extended at any time. Although the rule does not apply “to any proceedings in which the setting aside of a decision is not required”: see r 59.10(5), our preliminary view is that the three month period would either apply directly, or alternatively inform the Court’s discretion to grant declaratory relief, even though the formal setting aside of a decision is not required. The substance of the rule is that challenges to the exercise of executive power should be brought reasonably promptly, or else be accompanied by an explanation as to why that did not occur.
	
	
	In the present case, the summons was filed some five months after the decision, but was accompanied by an affidavit explaining the reasons for that delay in appropriate detail. The Attorney General confirmed that “we certainly don’t take any issue with the delay”. For that reason, it is unnecessary to express concluded views about the operation of Part 59. Instead, to the extent necessary, there should be an extension of time for the commencement of proceedings.
	
	
	More generally, and contrary to the tenor of Mr Buttrose’s submissions, just because a plaintiff seeks purely declaratory relief, it does not follow that the ordinary principles relating to judicial review cease to apply. In substance, this proceeding was one for judicial review, although (for good reason) no relief quashing a decision nor compelling the performance of a duty was sought.
	
	
	The question is whether the decision made by the judge is attended by jurisdictional error. That in turn depends upon the nature of the function his Honour was performing. The precondition to a direction that there be an inquiry or a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 79(1) is that “it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”. The statutory language is not whether there is a doubt or question, but whether there appears to be a doubt or question. That is to say, as Basten JA said in Sinkovich at [26], “it is the satisfaction of the judge as to the relevant condition which is critical.”
	
	
	We regard that question as having been determined by what was said in Sinkovich at [26], and Mr Buttrose’s submission to the contrary, which fell short of asking this Court to find that this aspect of Sinkovich was clearly wrong, as merely formal. In any event, unassisted by authority, we would readily reach the same conclusion, and not merely from the language of s 79, but also its context. The structure of s 79(1) is clear. Only if s 79(1) be satisfied will there be an inquiry or a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal, in which case the later steps will take place with the benefit of full submissions from the parties. In that context, it is only natural that all that is required is the judge forming the view – ordinarily, on limited material only – that there is a doubt or question.
	
	
	Judicial review of the exercise of executive power turning upon the state of mind of the donee is familiar: see for example Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24; 135 CLR 110 at 118. The question for determination here, therefore, was whether there was jurisdictional error in the judge failing to be satisfied that there was a doubt or question as to whether there was Muldrock error in the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Despite submissions to the contrary, it is fair to say, as the judge said at [18], that there was a single basis for Mr Buttrose’s challenge identified in the application, which was “that ‘Muldrock error’ must have occurred because of the length of the sentence imposed for Count 3.” It is sufficient to deal with that matter alone, and in light of the outcome of this proceeding, it is desirable to say no more than is necessary, and nothing which would fetter the parties or the judge who considers the application in the future, or indeed the Court of Criminal Appeal if a referral is made under s 79(1)(b).
	
	
	Three things persuade us that there was jurisdictional error in refusing the application. The first is that his Honour mis-stated the effect of the application before him. He said at [20] that [58]-[70] of the applicant’s submissions do “no more than to review the High Court’s decision in Muldrock and its effect on the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. It is expressed in general terms and has no direct application to any of the matters considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this matter.”
	
	
	True it is that most of those paragraphs of the applicant’s submissions are in general terms and answer his Honour’s description. The submission could have been put much more clearly and concisely than it was, especially since it was known that the application would be resolved on the papers. However a particular argument was advanced in paragraphs [68]-[69] on the last page of the submissions, which resembled that accepted by the Court in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50.
	
	
	Secondly, that argument is not without force. The earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal found that “the objective seriousness of the offence was above the mid-range but modestly so”. The standard non-parole period for the count under s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 (NSW) was 15 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed for that offence was 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. Allowing for the 45% discount for an early plea and assistance, the notional starting point was just over 16 years, squarely answering the description of “modestly” above the mid-range. Precisely the same form of “neat” arithmetic was employed by McCallum J in Bolt to strengthen her inference that the standard non-parole period had been used impermissibly as the starting point: see at [36]-[37].
	
	
	Indeed, the fact that the standard non-parole period was much greater (15 years as opposed to 5 years in Bolt) only makes the coincidence (which is the only other possibility so far as we can see) all the more unlikely.
	
	
	Thirdly, the submission made on the last page of the written submissions in support of the application was not squarely addressed by his Honour at all. Although his Honour correctly said that the Court of Criminal Appeal made no reference to the standard non-parole period, that is no answer to the inference the plaintiff invited his Honour to draw about the determinative role that it played in the resentencing exercise undertaken by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	For those three reasons, there was jurisdictional error because a substantial argument was not addressed. In reaching that conclusion, it is not necessary to determine whether the failure to address a substantial argument made by Mr Buttrose amounted to a denial of procedural fairness, or a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction, or both: see Plaintiff M61/2010E v Commonwealth of Australia [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 at [90], the decisions mentioned by Robertson J in Nufarm Australia Ltd v Dow AgroSciences Australia Ltd (No 2) [2011] FCA 757; 282 ALR 24 at [102]-[103], Roger v De Gelder [2015] NSWCA 211 at [89]-[96] and M Aronson and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action, (5th ed, 2013, Lawbook Co), at 264-266.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to say anything more, although the parties’ submissions ranged broadly. It is unnecessary in this proceeding to express a conclusion whether or not the inference to which the plaintiff pointed was made out. That is because the question arising under s 79(2) is merely whether “it appears that there is a doubt or question”. It is certainly possible that there may be a doubt or question sufficient to engage the power to refer to the Court of Criminal Appeal, in a process in which the other side is not heard and which ordinarily takes place on the papers, but nonetheless, after full argument, the appeal might be dismissed.
	
	
	But that is looking ahead. This Court was not asked to exercise the power under s 79, and it is far from clear to us that it can do so in proceedings of this nature. Mr Buttrose sought a declaration in the terms made in Sinkovich:
	


“Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge, and on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, such as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the plaintiff’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.”


	
	The same declaration should be made here. Mr Buttrose’s application has not yet been determined in accordance with law: Sinkovich at [77]. As in that case, no formal direction is required. It may be assumed that the application will be determined by a judge in due course in light of these reasons. The parties were agreed that, irrespective of the outcome, there should be no order as to costs.
	
	
	We propose the following orders:
	


1. To the extent necessary, extend the time for the commencement of this proceeding, pursuant to UCPR r 59.10(2), until 17 November 2014.

2. Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge, and on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, such as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the plaintiff’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.


	
	MACFARLAN JA: Following pleas of guilty in the Local Court, the plaintiff, Mr Richard William Buttrose, was sentenced in the District Court by Sorby DCJ on 18 March 2010 for various drug supply and related offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal subsequently quashed his sentences ([2011] NSWCCA 35) and re-sentenced him to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months. On the most serious of the charges, supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, he was, after regard was had to Form 1 offences, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 26 August 2009 and concluding on 25 August 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years concluding on 25 August 2021. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years specified.
	
	
	On 5 October 2011 the High Court delivered its judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 identifying the manner in which the standard non-parole periods specified in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) are to be taken into account in sentencing. The High Court’s decision overruled the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 which previously governed the issue in New South Wales.
	
	
	Subsequently, the plaintiff applied to the Supreme Court under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into his sentences and a direction that the Court refer his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) ([2014] NSWSC 826). The plaintiff contended that he had been sentenced in accordance with the law stated in R v Way, which the High Court in Muldrock later found to be incorrect. On 19 June 2014, Hoeben CJ at CL refused the application on the basis that no doubt or question existed as to whether the applicant had been sentenced in accordance with law.
	
	
	By a Summons filed on 17 November 2014, the plaintiff now seeks a declaration in the following terms:
	


“Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge, and on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, such as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the plaintiff’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.”


	
	For reasons that appear below I consider that, with one change, this declaratory relief should be granted to the plaintiff to facilitate him making a further application under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. The change is that the words “as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance” should be replaced with the words “as gives rise to a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance”.
	


Jurisdiction


	
	Sections 78 and 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act are, so far as is relevant, in the following terms:
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1)   An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2)   The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications

(1)   After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)   the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b)   the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)   Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)   The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:

(a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(4)   Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

… ”


	
	In Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342, Latham J found that “mitigating circumstances” in s 79(2) of that Act did not include errors of law (see [52]-[57]). Subsequently, a five judge bench of this Court found that that view was erroneous and that an error of law was indeed capable of giving rise to a “doubt or question” as to “any mitigating circumstances in the case”, including circumstances that have the potential to lower a convicted person’s sentence (Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783). This Court made a declaration to reflect that position and also concluded that the decision in Muldrock did not change the law but, rather, revealed what the law had been at the time that Mr Sinkovich had been sentenced (pre-Muldrock).
	
	
	In the present case, the judge recognised that relief under s 79(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act may be available if an error of law is established but found that the pre-condition imposed by s 79(2) to the court exercising its powers under s 79(1) had not been established. That is, there was no relevant “doubt or question” concerning the plaintiff’s sentences.
	
	
	The plaintiff does not seek judicial review of that finding in the present proceedings. Thus, he does not seek any order in the nature of certiorari or mandamus, or otherwise, under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Rather, he seeks declaratory relief, as was granted in Sinkovich.
	
	
	The Attorney General did not contest the plaintiff’s submission that “the Court has jurisdiction to grant a declaration on the basis of error of law and/or failure to accord procedural fairness, even where mandamus and certiorari may not issue” (written submissions [5], referring to Plaintiff M61/2010E v The Commonwealth; Plaintiff M69/2010 v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 at [8] and Sinkovich at [76]). Moreover, the Court’s broad jurisdiction to make a declaration does not depend upon the establishment of legal error (see Forster v Jododex [1972] HCA 61; 127 CLR 421 at 435 and 437-8; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10; 175 CLR 564 at 581-2 as to the width of the jurisdiction). As the plaintiff submitted a declaration may be made where, as here, it would effectively determine a legal controversy in which the plaintiff has a real interest (Plaintiff M61/2010E at [103]). There is practical utility in the making here of a declaration because the plaintiff is not precluded from making a further application under s 78 (Sinkovich at [77] and [88]). As to the latter point, I note that s 79(3)(a)(ii) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that one of the bases upon which an application under s 78 may be refused is that a previous application has been made and dealt with. The circumstances in which the discretion to refuse an interlocutory application (such as a s 78 application) because a previous application has been made were referred to by Emmett JA (with whom Leeming JA and Adamson J agreed) in Bajramovic v Calubaquib [2015] NSWCA 139 at [40]-[45]).
	
	
	In their written submissions lodged prior to the hearing before this Court, the parties assumed that the question to be determined was whether, as a matter of objective fact, a relevant “doubt or question” concerning the plaintiff’s sentences existed and that if it did, whether it was appropriate for the Court to make the declaration that the plaintiff sought. This Court, in the course of oral argument, queried whether the jurisdictional fact specified in s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act referred to the decision-making judge’s satisfaction as to the existence of a relevant “doubt or question” or the existence, in an objective sense, of that “doubt or question” (see for example Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at [140]; Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5; 199 CLR 135 at [28]-[38]; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS [2010] HCA 16; 240 CLR 611 at [16]-[31]). The parties were given leave to file further written submissions addressing that and other questions. In them Attorney General submitted that the relevant jurisdictional fact was the subjective satisfaction of the decision-making judge that there was a relevant “doubt or question”. On the other hand, the appellant submitted that the relevant jurisdictional fact was whether the “doubt or question” existed as a matter of objective fact.
	
	
	In my view, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue as, even if the Attorney General’s position is correct, a declaration as sought by the plaintiff, to the effect that as a matter of objective fact there is a relevant “doubt or question”, would have utility. The reason that it would have utility is, as I have noted above, that it is open to the plaintiff to make a further application under s 78. If the plaintiff makes such an application armed with a declaration of the type that I have described, his prospects of success will be improved immeasurably. Indeed, the judge hearing the application will have little choice but to make an order under s 79(1)(b) referring the plaintiff’s case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. Although it would be open to the judge hearing the further application to dismiss it on the basis that an earlier application had been made, this Court’s making of a relevant declaration after the previous application had been heard would be a powerful basis for resisting such a dismissal.
	


The standard non-parole period legislation


	
	The table in Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act specifies the standard non-parole periods for identified offences. Relevant parts of that Division include:
	


54A What is the standard non-parole period?

…

(2)   For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this Division that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.

54B Consideration of standard non-parole period in sentencing

(1)   This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence, or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to one or more offences, set out in the Table to this Division.

(2)   The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.

(3)   The court must make a record of its reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

(4)   When determining an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for one or more offences, the court is to indicate and make a written record of, for those offences to which a standard non-parole period applies, the non-parole period that it would have set for each such offence to which the aggregate sentence relates had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence.

(5)   If the court indicates under subsection (4) that it would have set a non-parole period for an offence that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period for the offence, the court must make a record of the reasons why it would have done so and must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

(6)   A requirement under this section for a court to make a record of reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period does not require the court to identify the extent to which the seriousness of the offence for which the non-parole period is set differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period is referable.

(7)   The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.”

R v Way and applications of the decision


	
	In R v Way, the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the standard non-parole periods specified in Division 1A were to be understood as applicable to sentences imposed after conviction at trial and not to those imposed after a plea of guilty (at [71]). The Court considered that where a standard non-parole period applied to an offence, the question: “Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?” should be asked and then answered by determining whether the objective seriousness of the offence fell into the mid-range of seriousness and considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances listed in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (at [117]-[118]). Where the question was answered in the affirmative, sentencing was to be in accordance with the established sentencing practice and relevant statutory provisions outside Division 1A (at [121]). In this exercise, “the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant” (at [122]). The Court stated that subjective features that were relevant because of their causal connection to the commission of the offence (such as motivation and mental illness) were to be considered in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence for the purposes of s 54A(2) (at [56]).
	
	
	Subsequent applications of R v Way included the following.
	
	
	In R v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218, Grove J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Hoeben J, as his Honour then was, agreed) criticised the sentencing judge for not adverting to the statutory non-parole period provisions and assessing, as a first step, whether the subject offence lay in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (at [44]).
	
	
	In R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338, McClellan CJ at CL said that the sentencing judge should have defined the extent to which he considered that the objective seriousness of the offence fell above mid-range (at [4]). In the same case, Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said that the sentencing judge must give some indication as to the degree to which the objective seriousness of the subject offence departs from the mid-range (at [39]).
	
	
	In R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110, Simpson J (with whom Grove and R A Hulme JJ agreed) surveyed earlier authorities, including R v Knight, and expressed a preference for what she saw as McClellan CJ at CL’s “slightly less prescriptive” approach, compare to that of Howie J in that case (at [75]-[87]).
	
	
	In R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Johnson JJ agreed) noted that on a number of occasions the Court of Criminal Appeal had stated that it was “necessary for sentencing judges to specify the extent or degree to which an offence depart[ed] from the notional offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness” (at [11]).
	


The Muldrock decision


	
	In Muldrock, the High Court concluded:
	


“26 Section 54B applies whenever a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a Div 1A offence. The provision must be read as a whole. It is a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to so much of s 54B(2) as appears before the word ‘unless’. Section 54B(2), read with ss 54B(3) and 21A, requires an approach to sentencing for Div 1A offences that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen:

""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" (emphasis added.)

27 Section 54B(2) and (3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ‘the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness’. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.

28 Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period” (citations omitted).


	
	Consistent with this reasoning, the High Court overruled R v Way on the basis that its approach, manifested in the passages quoted above from Reyes, Knight, McEvoy and Sellars (see [45]-[48] above), “is apt to distort the exercise of the sentencing discretion and … is not required by the terms of Div 1A” (at [21]). The High Court’s view that the concept of “objective seriousness” should not take account of any subjective factors was also conflicted with the view on that topic expressed in R v Way.
	


The Court of Criminal Appeal’s application of Muldrock


	
	On a large number of occasions, the Court of Criminal Appeal has since had to consider whether appeals determined in the period between the decisions in R v Way and Muldrock were erroneous in light of the pronouncements the latter made. Most of these involved an appeal by an offender, unlike the present case where the plaintiff exhausted his appeal rights (by the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision of 10 March 2011) prior to Muldrock being decided.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has decided that Muldrock error cannot be assumed simply because a sentence was imposed between the dates of R v Way and Muldrock (see Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235 at [29] per Bellew J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Button J agreed; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] per Davies J with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed; Diaz v R [2013] NSWCCA 277 at [109] per Button J with whom Macfarlan JA and Adams J agreed). The plaintiff does not challenge the correctness of this proposition.
	
	
	In Rajendran v R [2014] NSWCCA 113, Bellew J (with whom Gleeson JA and Hamill J agreed) stated:
	


“34 This Court has observed on a number of occasions that in determining whether or not a Muldrock–type error has been established, it is necessary to review the reasons for sentence as a whole and not confine examination to one particular passage or sentence which is said to reflect error …”.


	
	In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) said:
	


“26 … Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.”


	
	His Honour’s suggestion that it is necessary to ascertain whether “a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this court must intervene” is now incorrect in light of the subsequent High Court decision in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 in which the plurality rejected the proposition that it is Court of Criminal Appeal’s function to “assess whether and to what degree an identified error influenced the outcome” of a sentencing process (at [42]).
	
	
	In Kazzi v R [2014] NSWCCA 73, Button J (with whom Leeming JA and R S Hulme AJ agreed) observed that “during the years when R v Way was binding authority on sentencing judges, sentencing after a plea of guilty had been entered did not call for the rigidly structured approach. So much was clear from the judgment of this Court in R v Way” (at [45]). His Honour concluded:
	


“47 In short, although Muldrock v The Queen effected significant changes to sentencing practice in New South Wales with regard to offences attracting a standard non-parole period after a trial, the same cannot be said about sentencing practice with regard to such offences after a plea of guilty.”


	
	In the present case, the plaintiff disputed the accuracy of the observations above. In particular, the plaintiff pointed out that R v Way itself, as well as Knight, McEvoy and Sellars, concerned sentences following pleas of guilty and that the High Court criticised each of those decisions in Muldrock. However, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue because whether or not the general practice prior to Muldrock was to apply principles inconsistent with Muldrock in cases involving pleas of guilty is not of present significance. Rather, the point to be determined is whether the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in Mr Buttrose’s case was erroneous for that reason.
	
	
	The plaintiff relied heavily on the decision in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50, a case of conviction following a plea of guilty, the correctness of which was not challenged by the Attorney General.
	
	
	In Bolt, McCallum J (with whom Beazley JA, as she then was, and Harrison J agreed) said:
	


“35 … [I]n my view, a fair reading of the remarks on sentence as a whole, knowing they were made before Muldrock was decided, reveals that the Judge did in effect adopt a two-staged process of reasoning, beginning with his assessment that the offence was placed just below the mid range of objective seriousness for that type of offence. I think it is highly likely that, informed by that assessment, his Honour used the standard non-parole period as the springboard from which he delved into the task of balancing the other factors identified.

36 My conclusion on that issue is reinforced by the neatness of the mathematics involved. As already noted, before applying the discount of twenty-five percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea, the Judge must have started with a head sentence of six years and eight months. The structure of that sentence in accordance with the statutory ratio would have been a non-parole period of exactly five years with a balance of term of twenty months. The non-parole period of three years and six months ultimately imposed can be reconciled by the application of the discount for the plea and a small adjustment to the statutory ratio to reflect the finding of special circumstances. The figure thus reached neatly reflected his Honour's assessment that the offence was placed just below the mid range.

37 In those circumstances, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Judge used the standard non-parole period of five years as a starting point, even acknowledging that it stood only as a guide in light of the plea.”


	
	In Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285, Allsop P (with whom Price J agreed) took a similar approach, as follows:
	


“91 It is difficult to conclude in the circumstances of the case, in particular in the light of the medical evidence, that the SNPP was not given determinative significance, or at least a significance not warranted given the applicant's mental condition. There is no particular expression of reasons that would immediately reveal operative error from an approach derived from R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 that could be seen to be disapproved in Muldrock. Nevertheless, the conformance of the sentence in fact with a calculation that can be derived from working back from 15 years, with a 15 per cent discount and a characterisation of slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness, leads one to infer that such weight was given to the SNPP that it contributed to a sentence of excessive severity. Certainly the sentencing judge can be taken to have followed the then present orthodoxy of approach following Way before it was corrected in Muldrock: Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 at [35]-[36]; Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [4]. It is not necessary to come to a final view about whether the sentencing judge made this error. Its possibility may assist, however, in explaining the heaviness of the sentence.”


	
	Likewise, in Sinkovich v R [2014] NSWCCA 97, R A Hulme J (with whom Basten JA and Fullerton J agreed), in finding Muldrock error, noted that without a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the non-parole period imposed would have been almost the same as the standard non-parole period for the relevant offence (at [35]). Bearing in mind that the sentencing judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the relevant offence was “slightly above the mid-range”, his Honour took the view that this reflected too much weight being placed on the standard non-parole period (ibid).
	
	
	Earlier this year in McDonald v R [2015] NSWCCA 80, R A Hulme and Adamson JJ concluded that the sentencing judge had simply used the standard non-parole period as a legislative guidepost without giving it determinative significance or adopting a two-stage approach (see [43]-[46]). In dissent, Basten JA said that “there is no reason to suppose that the sentencing judge was doing [anything] other than having regard to the standard non-parole period in accordance with the approach, then understood to be correct, as identified in Way” (at [7]).
	
	
	In Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90 Simpson J (with whom Basten JA and Adamson J agreed) took a different view in relation to the sentencing judgment in that case. Her Honour observed:
	


“33 It is not lightly to be concluded that a sentencing judge during that period departed from the principles stated in Way. That is particularly so where the conviction is after trial (because Way held that standard non-parole periods did not apply to conviction following pleas of guilty, but stood as ‘a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost’ (at [122]). Even if the language of Way is not reproduced in the Remarks on Sentence, thus clearly identifying ‘Muldrock error’ (probably more correctly called ‘Way error’), the strong likelihood is that the Way approach governed the sentencing. If that were not so, it would have to be concluded that the sentencing judge failed to apply the law as it was then understood and widely known. … ”.

The Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in Mr Buttrose’s case


	
	McClellan CJ at CL gave the principal judgment in Mr Buttrose’s pre-Muldrock appeal (see [30] above). His Honour found error in the sentencing process relating to the most serious offence that the applicant (the present plaintiff) was convicted of, namely, that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that the sentencing judge’s determination of the objective seriousness of that offence was erroneous. As to the latter, his Honour found, contrary to the sentencing judge’s finding, that the evidence did not demonstrate that Mr Buttrose “was involved in the organisation of a supply chain or had himself employed others to assist in the distribution of drugs” (at [48]).
	
	
	On the present application the Attorney General accepts that his Honour then proceeded to have regard to evidence of the applicant’s motivation in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. In this respect his Honour referred to the scale of the applicant’s business appearing to have been a product of his engaging personality and to his apparent “personal gratification from his recognition as the supplier of cocaine to many people in the Eastern Suburbs” (ibid). His Honour held that the objective seriousness of the offence was “above the mid-range but modestly so” (at [51]), that the applicant had significant prospects of rehabilitation and had given assistance to authorities.
	
	
	His Honour noted that he had been referred to earlier decisions including Wang v R [2009] NSWCCA 223; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38; Coetzee v R [2007] NSWCCA 12; Sukkar v R [2007] NSWCCA 298; R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111 and R v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229 and said that they were “useful in providing an understanding of some other sentences of varying degrees of significance to the present matter” (at [40]).
	
	
	His Honour concluded as follows:
	


“54 Having regard to these matters in my judgment the appropriate sentence for count 3 was a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years.”

Hoeben CJ at CL’s decision on the s 78 application


	
	His Honour’s reasons for concluding that Mr Buttrose had not identified any Muldrock error in the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment, and that there was no “doubt or question” as to the existence of such an error, appear from the following passages in his Honour’s decision:
	


“18 A major difficulty in this case is that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not refer to the standard non-parole period at all in its reasoning towards the identification of error, or in its reasoning leading up to re-sentencing the applicant. The basis for the applicant's challenge seems to be an assertion that ‘Muldrock error’ must have occurred because of the length of the sentence imposed for Count 3. Other than inviting such an inference to be drawn, the applicant was not able to identify any ‘Muldrock error’ in the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

…

21 The assertion [in the Attorney General’s written submissions] that ‘the Court of Criminal Appeal only reduced the sentence to a limited extent, again relying upon the important role to be played by the standard non-parole period referable to Count 3’ is unsubstantiated. This is because the Court of Criminal Appeal made no reference to the standard non-parole period. There was no assertion, either implicitly or expressly, by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the standard non-parole period was determinative, nor did the Court of Criminal Appeal engage in a two stage sentencing process.

22 What the Court of Criminal Appeal focused upon were errors in fact finding by the primary judge, which in turn resulted in an erroneous assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 3. There is nothing in Muldrock to suggest that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is impermissible in a sentencing judgment. On the contrary, the High Court endorsed the importance of properly assessing the objective seriousness of an offence” (his Honour then quoted [27] of Muldrock – see [49] above).

Resolution of Mr Buttrose’s application for declaratory relief


	
	For the following reasons, I conclude that, in terms of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, there is a “doubt or question” as to whether there is the Court of Criminal Appeal’s re-sentencing of Mr Buttrose involved Muldrock error and therefore gives rise to a doubt or question, again in terms of that section, as to a “mitigating circumstance[e] in the case”. It is unnecessary for this Court to decide whether such error in fact arose. Indeed, it is undesirable that it do so as that would pre-empt the decision that the Court of Criminal Appeal will need to make when, as seems inevitable, the plaintiff’s case is referred to it by the Supreme Court under s 79(1)(b) following a further application under s 78(1).
	
	
	My conclusion does not involve any criticism of the earlier Court of Criminal Appeal decision because, as was its duty, the Court applied the then binding decision in R v Way, Muldrock not having then been decided. I also reiterate that the arguments put to this Court on the present application extended well beyond those put to Hoeben CJ at CL (see further [40] above). The Attorney General objected to the plaintiff putting arguments to this Court that were not put to Hoeben CJ at CL but in my view the plaintiff should not be precluded from doing so as such arguments, if sound, might well form the basis of a further application under s 78. Given that the parties have now fully addressed those arguments, it is better that they be dealt with in this judgment.
	
	
	I note at the outset, without attaching any particular significance to it, that it was not strictly correct for his Honour to say that the Court of Criminal Appeal made no reference to the standard non-parole period in its re-sentencing of the applicant. It did so in paragraphs [3] and [5] when describing the principal offence and total sentence respectively. More importantly, as in Bolt, Devaney and Sinkovich (see [59], [60] and [61] above), the mathematics involved in the re-sentence suggest that, consistently with R v Way, that the Court of Criminal Appeal may have taken the standard non-parole period of 15 years as a starting point, and, using the two stage approach proscribed in Muldrock, adjusted it to reach an appropriate non-parole period. In light of the 45% discount given for the plaintiff’s guilty plea and assistance to authorities the Court of Criminal Appeal’s starting point for the head sentence for the principal offence (disregarding that discount) must have been 21.8 years. Applying the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence (see s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), the resulting non-parole period would have been approximately 16 years and 4 months compared to a statutory non-parole period of 15 years. This appears to reflect the Court of Criminal Appeal’s determination that the principal offence was above the mid-range of objective seriousness but only “modestly so” (see [65] above).
	
	
	The inference that the Court of Criminal Appeal reasoned in this fashion is consistent with the structure of its judgment which proceeds from a determination of objective seriousness to a determination of sentence, with little intruding in the analysis other than the discount that I referred to earlier. The only other matter mentioned by the Court was Mr Buttrose’s rehabilitation, about which the Court made only a guarded finding that the applicant had prospects of rehabilitation (at [52]).
	
	
	To adopt the expression of McCallum J in Bolt, “it would hardly be surprising if the decision entailed the application of the principles overturned in Muldrock” (at [32]) as R v Way was then binding and McClellan CJ at CL had himself, in the authoritative decision in Knight (see [46] above), quoted and applied the R v Way principles.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal also took into account a subjective factor, namely, Mr Buttrose’s motivation, when assessing the objective seriousness of the principal offence (see [65] above). This conflicted with the express proscription of this course in Muldrock (see [49] above).
	
	
	Prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods in 2002, whether or not any particular subjective factor was taken into account in assessing objective seriousness was of no particular significance, as long as it was taken into account somewhere in the sentencing process. Statutory standard non-parole periods introduced in 2002 are however referable to offences “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” (s 54A(2)). Regard to the standard non-parole period in accordance with R v Way or in accordance with Muldrock could not, and cannot, sensibly occur without an appreciation of whether the offence of which the offender has been convicted is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. This determination requires an understanding of what is or is not relevant to the concept of objective seriousness. To relate the point to the present case, the Court of Criminal Appeal must be considered as having applied the standard non-parole period to the offence because it took motivation into account in assessing objective seriousness when Muldrock requires that that factor be excluded.
	
	
	Accordingly, whilst it is true that, even under Muldrock, objective seriousness must be assessed (so that the guidepost of the standard non-parole period can be properly understood), the factors relevant to that assessment are significant and if a factor excluded from consideration by Muldrock is taken into account, error will have occurred.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Court of Criminal Appeal’s reliance on earlier decisions is of some, although limited, significance when considering whether its judgment as a whole reveals Muldrock error. Of those decisions (listed at [66] above), XX and Sukkar compared the non-parole periods fixed with the standard non-parole period and the Court in El-Helou expressly relied upon Knight in criticising the sentencing judge for not giving reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period (at [72]). As noted earlier, Muldrock expressly rejected the reasoning in Knight.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the reasons that I have given there is a “doubt or question” whether the 2011 Court of Criminal Appeal decision involved Muldrock error. As a result, the Court should make a declaration in the terms that I have described in [33] and [34] above. The parties agreed that the Court should not make any order as to costs.

Introduction


	
	This is an application made under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) concerning earlier judgments of this Court in respect of convictions of and sentences imposed on the applicant. On 21 March 2014 an appeal brought by the applicant against his convictions in 2007 and 2009 in the District Court and the sentences imposed on him in relation to those offences was dismissed: Miller v R [2014] NSWCCA 34. On 31 March 2014 the applicant applied under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to set aside the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal and reopen and redetermine the appeal. The applicant has also appealed from an additional conviction in and sentence imposed by the District Court for further offences of dishonesty in 2012. That appeal was heard on 11 September 2014 by other members of the Court, whose judgment is presently reserved. The applicant was refused bail in relation to that matter by Adamson J on 13 April 2014 and again by Davies J on 27 March 2014. The applicant’s application under r 50C also seeks a review by this Court and reconsideration of these refusals to grant him bail. (He also applied for disqualification of all Justices of this Court from hearing and determining all his applications and appeals but this was not pressed when the application came on for hearing.)
	


Background


	
	In June 2007 the applicant was convicted by a jury in the District Court on an indictment charging him with one count of obtaining financial advantage by deception and four counts of using a false instrument, respectively being offences under ss 178BA and 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). These charges arose out of the circumstances surrounding the purchase of a thoroughbred racehorse and frauds allegedly committed upon a Mr Ivan Pagett and the ANZ Bank. The applicant was sentenced to an overall term of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 20 June 2007 with an effective non-parole period of 3 years. In August 2009 the applicant was convicted in the District Court (Knox DCJ, sitting alone) of two counts of obtaining a benefit by deception contrary s 178BA, three counts of obtaining a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BB and one count of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act. He was acquitted of one of the s 178BA charges and convicted on the remaining counts. This trial involved frauds allegedly committed upon a Mr Giovanni Caperelli. In respect of four of the counts he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 11 December 2009 and, in respect of the remaining count (under s 178BA), an overall sentence of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 11 June 2010 with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on the same day and expiring on 10 June 2013. In respect of the 2013 convictions he was sentenced to an overall term of 10 years from 9 June 2013, with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	


The nature of the applicant’s case


	
	In his written submissions in support of his application it is clear that the applicant’s grounds are, essentially, that the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal which dismissed his appeals against his convictions and sentences was fundamentally flawed, exhibiting “manifest errors in the application of facts and applicable law that relevantly arises from case authority decided after the filing of the original grounds and submissions of appeal” and “that the reasons for judgment… contain significant misapplications and misinterpretations of the facts of the case and applicable law and other important omissions to assess facts relating to the grounds of appeal which have been ignored”. The applicant then listed a number of alleged errors dealing with the treatment of various aspects of the evidence, exhibiting what the applicant contends was “specious reasoning designed by the court to avoid having to assess the contents of the [relevant] documents in the context of … [the] appeals and his complaint that he was not provided with them under obligations of pre-trial disclosure”. He also submitted “that had the Court of Criminal Appeal approached its task correctly, it would have formed the view that the 3 Crown witnesses had no credibility or believability at all, the basis of which was clearly set out in the appeal grounds and submissions but never properly assessed”. Further details are given as to alleged failures to scrutinise the evidence as to particular matters either sufficiently or at all, misapprehensions of the nature of the circumstantial evidence and errors in not receiving evidence suggested to be fresh.
	
	
	The character of the case sought to be made on the application is sufficiently gathered from the following paragraphs in his written submissions –
	


“[2]. Both appeals were raised on all grounds and were dismissed in a written decision dated 21/3/14 by their Honours Justices Harrison SCJ, Johnson SCJ and Adamson SCJ which the appellant complains is unjustified in law and arises in circumstances that indicate the Court held erroneous views about the facts of the cases appealed and made significant errors and omissions in its assessment of the appeals.

[3]. The appellant is very aggrieved over deficient standards he submits have been applied by the Justices in the assessment of his grounds and submissions of appeal who dismissed the appeals through error and omission and seeks leave under rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules (1952) N.S.W. to have them corrected.

[4]. It is sought to set aside the judgment and orders of the Court and have the appeals reopened and redetermined in relation to these errors and omissions in the principle ground of appeal (ground 1) that the Crown and investigating police Detective SC Ray Hetherington did not provide a fair trial to the appellant.

[5]. This concerned the mandatory pre-trial disclosure of crucial documentary evidence seized from the appellant by a Detective Ray Hetherington on 20 January, 2005 who investigated the offences, which was also known to the Crown.

[6]. The Court's reasons for its decision contain manifest errors in the application of facts and applicable law that relevantly arises from case authority decided after the filing of the original grounds and submissions of appeal.

[7]. Further submitted is that the reasons for judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal contain significant misapplications and misinterpretations of the facts of the case and applicable law and other important omissions to assess facts relating to the grounds of appeal which have been ignored.”


	
	After a lengthy and discursive discussion of various aspects of the evidence claimed to have been misunderstood or not considered by the Court the applicant said –
	


“[104]. The appellant submits the following grounds of appeal herein, which are indistinguishable in substance from those set out in the original appeal papers filed in N.I.A. 4101/07. Grounds 1 and 2 are modified but make the same complaint for assessment by an objective and impartial Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to error sought to be rectified under rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules (1952) NSW and those orders sought in the appended Notices of Motion if required. (Emphasis added.)

GROUND 1: THERE HAS BEEN A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IN THE TRIAL OF THE APPELLANT ON ACCOUNT OF FRESH EVIDENCE OR EVIDENCE NOT PROVIDED BY THE CROWN IN MANDATORY PRE-TRIAL DISCLOSURE.

GROUND 2: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THE CROWN TO DISCLOSE AND PRODUCE COGENT EVIDENCE TAKEN BY DETECTIVE HETHERINGTON IN RELATION TO A FILE OF DOCUMENTS TITLED ""MAVIS BANNISTER"" WHICH WAS EXCULPATORY OF THE APPELLANT AND A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS.

GROUND 3: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THE POLICE INFORMANT, DETECTIVE HETHERINGTON TO CONDUCT A PERTINENT AND DILIGENT INVESTIGATION OF THE MATTER.

GROUND 4: THE VERDICT IS UNREASONABLE AND CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE.

GROUND 5: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY INADEQUATE DIRECTIONS GIVEN BY THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE IN RELATION TO:

(a) Discrepant facts going to the credibility of Crown witnesses Ray Gall, Brett Gall and Brian Purkiss concerning the alleged purchase by the Appellant of a thoroughbred racehorse from Ray Gall;

(b) The use to which evidence of the thoroughbred transaction (if believed) could be put in respect of the drawing of inferences of fact;

(c) Warnings concerning the drawing of inferences of fact concerning the 4 counts of the use of false instruments from the evidence of the thoroughbred transaction.”


	
	There then followed further discursive (and largely repetitive) submissions about the nature of the case made against him at trial which, he claimed, was inadequately considered by the Court.
	
	
	In addition to the complaints made by the applicant about the way in which his appeal was considered and determined, is the complaint that the duties of the police and Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of pre-trial disclosure of documents (the “Mavis Bannister file”) led, the applicant contended, to a miscarriage of justice. During argument on the appeal the applicant had referred to evidence of Detective Hetherington to the effect that the file (referred to as comprising “some crucial documents”) was in the applicant’s bag when he was arrested and that Detective Hetherington said that, keeping no copy, he returned it but was unable to say to whom he gave them. The applicant said that possession of these documents “would have enabled me to have given further and better instructions to counsel and for them to have planned my defence in a much more fulsome way”.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submission on the appeal against conviction referred to his assertion in an affidavit that, on 22 August 2009 (the day following his conviction) a cardboard box containing about 4,000 pages of documents was delivered to the gaol where he was imprisoned. The applicant deposed that, among others, it contained particular documents, identified as annexures “C”, “D”, “E”, “G”, “I”, “J” and “K”. Although this box was delivered by the ODPP (having been collected from the Court’s registry), the documents in it had come from the applicant’s lawyers and had earlier been produced to the Court for the purposes of an interlocutory application. According to an affidavit from the relevant employee of the ODPP, the box contained only documents that had come from the lawyers and, furthermore, annexures “J” and “K” were not amongst them. The annexures, particularly “J” and “K”, were the documents submitted by the applicant on his appeal as new evidence which, had it been available at trial, would have given rise, he claimed, to a significant possibility of acquittal. In the appeal, the Crown had first submitted that the documents did not constitute fresh or new evidence since they had been available to the applicant before or at the trial and, indeed, he had relied on them to seek a permanent stay. Secondly, the Crown in substance submitted that annexures “J” and “K” (asserted by the applicant to have come to light by this delivery) were in fact not amongst documents which had been sent. Their provenance and authenticity were therefore questionable. In the result, the Court concluded (ibid at [145], [146]) that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that documents “J” and “K” were in existence at the relevant time or, if they were, that they were not available to him at his trial. In short there was nothing that might qualify as fresh or new evidence. The grounds of appeal concerning these issues were thus dismissed.
	
	
	For reasons that do not presently matter, the applicant himself made oral submissions to the Court in respect of one of his appeals, during the course of which he mentioned the Mavis Bannister file in the terms quoted above. However, that file had been referred to neither in his written submissions nor his grounds of appeal. He raised it in this way (following submissions on the annexures) –
	


“If I could say one thing that would assist your Honours, when Detective Hetherington gave evidence in regard to these documents he indicated that he had, without authority, returned some crucial documents that were related to a file kept in respect of a woman by the name of Mavis Bannister whom I had referred to Mr Williams for some legal work…”

It is clear that this called for no consideration, let alone findings, by the Court.


	
	Rule 50C
	


50C Power to set aside or vary order (cf UCPR rule 36.16)

(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.

(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.

(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.

(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).

(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.

It is agreed that the application was brought within the time specified in r 50C(2).

The scope of the rule


	
	A useful starting point for considering the basic underlying principle governing reconsiderations of the present kind is Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431. The applicant’s appeal against convictions and sentences at Quarter Sessions was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and his application for special leave to appeal refused by the High Court. Representations on his behalf to the relevant Minister for an enquiry under (what was then) s 475 of the Crimes Act were unsuccessful. Grierson then made a further application to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal against his conviction and sentences. The Court upheld a preliminary objection taken by the Solicitor General that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the application since an appeal had already been determined on the merits and dismissed. Grierson’s application for special leave to appeal was refused. Dixon J explained (ibid at 435-6) –
	


“The Supreme Court held … that a second appeal from a conviction could not be entertained after the dismissal, upon the merits, of an appeal or application for leave to appeal and that the first appeal could not be reopened after the final determination.

In my opinion this conclusion is correct. The jurisdiction is statutory, and the court has no further authority to set aside a conviction upon indictment than the statute confers. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) … defines the grounds, prescribes the procedure and states the duty of the court. The statute deals with criminal appeals … as a right or benefit conferred on prisoners convicted of indictable offences and sets out the kind of convictions and sentences from which they may appeal and lays down the conditions on which they may appeal as a right and by leave and the procedure which they must observe. It limits the time within which appeals and applications for leave to appeal may be brought, subject, however, to a discretionary power in the court to extend the period except where a sentence is capital. The grounds or principles upon which the court is to determine appeals are stated, and the duty is imposed on the court of dismissing an appeal, unless on those principles it determines that it should be allowed. The determination of an appeal is evidentially definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings. Appeal is not a common law remedy, and proceedings at law are only subject to that remedy by statute…

If the prisoner has abandoned his appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England will exercise a discretion to enable him to withdraw his notice of abandonment, notwithstanding that it operates as a dismissal of the appeal … But in such a case there has been no determination by the court, and there is no English case in which, after such a determination, an appeal has been reopened or a fresh appeal has been entertained.”


	
	In Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; (2008) 238 CLR 218 this Court had dismissed the appellant’s appeals against conviction and sentence, publishing its reasons for doing so and pronouncing orders effecting this outcome. However, after the orders had been formally recorded, the Court discovered that its reasons contained substantial factual errors (arising from the way in which the appeal documents had come before it) and, after it revisited its conclusions in light of the errors, ordered that the dismissal of the appeals should be “confirmed”. Allowing Burrell’s appeal, Gummow ACJ, Hayne, Heyden, Crennan and Kiefel JJ stated –
	


“[15] …[It] is important to recognise that underpinning consideration of the issues presented in this matter are fundamental principles about finality of litigation. As was said in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 17 [34]: ""A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances."" That tenet finds reflection in rules concerning the bringing of an action to set aside a final judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud … and in doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel. The principal qualification to the general principle of finality is provided by the appellate system. But in courts other than the court of final resort, the tenet also finds reflection in the restrictions upon reopening of final orders after they have been formally recorded.

[16] …

[17] It is desirable to expose and explore a premise that underpinned the debate in the present matter about the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The premise for the arguments of both the appellant and the respondent was that the formal recording of the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal was a significant step. Why is that so? In answering that question it is desirable to notice a point about terminology: the use in this context of the word ""perfected"" or cognate words.

[18] The formal recording of the orders of a superior court of record is often referred to as the ""perfecting"" of that order. Whether a court may reopen a proceeding and reconsider the order that has been pronounced is often described as hinging about whether the order has been ""perfected"". This use of terminology must not be seen as giving form and procedure precedence over substance and principle. The questions that arise in this matter must depend for their answer not upon what forms and solemnities have been observed but upon how effect is to be given to the principle of finality. In particular, what is to mark the point at which a court concludes its consideration of a controversy?

[19] The end of a court's powers to consider and determine a controversy cannot depend upon whether one party asserts that the court has made some error in the conclusion it has reached. If allegation of error in the court's orders were the criterion, there would never be an end to some disputes. And because one party's assertion of error cannot provide a sufficient criterion, a court's belief that it has recognised its own mistake can provide no useful criterion. Such a belief could provide no useful criterion because, in the end, the accuracy of the belief would have to be tested against the arguments of the parties. It follows therefore that no matter whether it is a party that alleges error, or it is the court itself which believes that it recognises its own error, a decision that an error had been made could be reached only after giving all parties an opportunity to be heard. And it is this reargument of issues that would constitute the departure from the principle of finality.

[20] Identifying the formal recording of the order of a superior court of record as the point at which that court's power to reconsider the matter is at an end provides a readily ascertainable and easily applied criterion. But more than that, identifying the formal recording of the order as the watershed both marks the end of the litigation in that court, and provides conclusive certainty about what was the end result in that court.

[21] The power to correct the record so that it truly does represent what the court pronounced or intended to pronounce as its order … provides no substantial qualification to that rule. The power to correct an error arising from accidental slip or omission, whether under a specific rule of court or otherwise, directs attention to what the court whose record is to be corrected did or intended to do. It does not permit reconsideration, let alone alteration, of the substance of the result that was reached and recorded.

[22] Neither the appellant nor the respondent challenged any of these propositions. Rather, the accepted premise for the debate was that formal recording of the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal ordinarily does mark the end of that Court's power to consider the issues which were tendered in the proceedings that yielded those orders. Hence the expression of the question for this Court as whether the Court of Criminal Appeal had power to reopen the appellant's appeals and reconsider its orders. And, as explained earlier, if the Court of Criminal Appeal had power to reopen the appellant's appeals and reconsider the orders it had made, that power must be found in ""the text of the governing statutes and any express or implied powers to be seen therein"" (DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 247). That is, the power must be found in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"").

[23] …

[24] In Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431; [1938] HCA 45, this Court held that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales ""is statutory, and the court has no further authority to set aside a conviction upon indictment than the statute confers"" ... More particularly, this Court held that the Court of Criminal Appeal had no jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which it had heard upon the merits and finally determined. Grierson has been followed in this Court on a number of occasions, most recently in Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; (2007) 82 ALJR 82 at 85 [7]; [2007] HCA 51; 239 ALR 651 at 654.

[25] The Solicitor-General for New South Wales, appearing for the respondent in the present proceedings, expressly disclaimed any application to have this Court reconsider its decision in Grierson. Instead, the Solicitor-General submitted only that, ""[i]f there was a denial of procedural fairness in this matter it lay in the fact that the order [disposing of the appeal] was perfected the same day and very soon after the reasons for judgment were handed down"" and that ""[i]f the denial of procedural fairness qualification referred to in [Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 484] and [Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300] applied, then this inadvertent procedural unfairness may have allowed the court to re-open the order to allow the acknowledged factual errors to be corrected"" (emphasis added).

[26] It is not necessary to consider whether some forms of denial of procedural fairness could warrant grafting some exception upon the general rule stated in Grierson. Nor is it necessary to examine what was said in either Pantorno or Postiglione about these matters. Neither case decided that the general rule in Grierson should be qualified according to whether there had been a denial of procedural fairness. It is therefore not necessary to consider what root could be found in the Criminal Appeal Act for such a proposition, and as both Grierson and DJL at 247 make abundantly plain, it is there that the source of any such exception must be found.

[27] Rather, it is sufficient in this case to say that formally recording the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal before the parties had examined the published reasons of the Court did not amount to any denial of procedural fairness. Each party had had a full opportunity to place his or its arguments before the Court of Criminal Appeal. If either party had detected the factual errors made in this matter in the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal before its orders were perfected, that party could have and should have (Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1940] HCA 9; (1940) 63 CLR 382 at 457; DJL [2000] HCA 17; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 244) at once moved the Court of Criminal Appeal to intercept the processes of formal recording of the orders and to hear argument about whether errors had been made. But it would be contrary to principle to hold that the Court of Criminal Appeal must afford a sufficient opportunity for parties to consider whether such an application should be made.

[28] The parties to an appeal are given procedural fairness by allowing each a proper opportunity to make submissions before the court makes its decision. Once the court announces the decision it has made, any further hearing is exceptional. To hold that parties must be given a sufficient opportunity to consider whether to ask for a further hearing would convert the exception into the rule. That step should not be taken.”


	
	It will be seen, from [25] above that the plurality apparently accepted that, had the orders not been perfected, the issue raised by the discovery of the mistaken facts could have been considered by the Court and submissions invited as to its significance (as was, indeed, done but too late). The cited passage from Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1940] HCA 9; (1940) 63 CLR 382 at 457 comes from the judgment of Starke J (omitting references) –
	


“… Even if the board had reached the conclusion that its former pronouncement was wrong, I see no reason why it should not have corrected any mistake that it had made and promulgated a proper decision so long as it was seised of the matter for the purpose of review. A superior court of justice, it may be remarked, has full power to rehear or review a case until judgment is drawn up, passed, and entered…”

This was followed in DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17; (2000) 201 CLR 226 with additional observations –

“[34] The common law courts, as superior courts of record, had ""full power to rehear or review a case until judgment [was] drawn up, passed, and entered"". That statement, with citation of supporting authority, was made by Starke J in Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation ... Even after entry of judgment, an error arising from an accidental slip or omission might be corrected at any time by further order in the action and even without an enabling rule of court (L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council [No 2] [1982] HCA 59; (1982) 151 CLR 590 at 594-595). An order also might be made in the action for the correction of the records of the court to make certain that they truly represented what the court had pronounced or had intended to pronounce (Ainsworth v Wilding [1896] 1 Ch 673 at 678-679; Ivanhoe Gold Corporation Ltd v Symonds (1906) 4 CLR (Pt 1) 642 at 669). It also appears that a judgment might be set aside after entry if the parties to the judgment consented, although in deciding whether to make such an order the court would have regard to the interests of third parties (Permanent Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd v Stocks & Holdings (Canberra) Pty Ltd (1976) 15 ACTR 45. Finally, where the business of the court was so organised that some orders were made in chambers, those orders may have been open to review by motion in the action, even if they were final orders (C H Giles & Co Ltd v Morris [1972] 1 WLR 307 at 313; [1972] 1 All ER 960 at 965).”

This reflects the fundamental distinction created by the “watershed” effect of formal entry.


	
	In R v Reardon [2004] NSWCCA 197; (2004) 60 NSWLR 454; (2004) 146 A Crim R 475 documents were produced following argument on appeals which had not been available at the initial hearing and leave was given to one of the appellants to put on further submissions. The further submissions based on these documents dealt with the issues in respect of which leave had been granted but also added a contention which was outside the grounds of appeal, in respect of which no application to amend had been made. In its subsequent judgment, the Court dealt with all issues raised by the grounds of appeal and those in respect of which leave to make further submissions had been granted but it did not deal with the additional contention. The appellant then applied to reopen the appeal on the ground that he was denied procedural fairness, since one of his arguments was not dealt with by the Court. Hodgson JA (with whom Simpson and Barr JJ agreed) considered whether the Court of Criminal Appeal could reopen a case after its orders had been perfected, commencing with Grierson and then taking up contentions put on behalf of the appellant that there were qualifications to the principle enunciated in that case. His Honour pointed out (ibid at [26]) a qualification may have been raised in Jones v The Queen [1989] HCA 16; (1989) 166 CLR 409; (1989) 39 A Crim R 400, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tasmania upheld two of a number of grounds of appeal, quashed the conviction and directed that there be a new trial but had not dealt with other grounds which, if accepted, would have led instead to a verdict of acquittal. The High Court of Australia upheld the appeal and ordered that the matter be remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal to complete the hearing and determination of the appeal. Mason CJ and Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (166 CLR 409 at 414-5) –
	


“The order of the Court of Criminal Appeal has been perfected. Counsel for both parties in this Court approached the application for special leave on the footing that it is now too late for the applicant to move the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine the grounds left undetermined. If that be right - and in this case we should assume but not decide that it is - it is regrettable that when the omissions from the reasons for judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal became known and before the formal order of the Court was perfected such an application was not made to the Court. Now, in order to ensure that the applicant's appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal is fully determined, it is necessary to vary that Court's judgment and to remit the matter for further hearing and determination.”


	
	As Hodgson JA observed (Reardon at [27]) –
	


“Thus the majority in that case left open the possibility that, even after an order has been perfected, a Court of Criminal Appeal may be able to reopen the case to hear and determine grounds of appeal left undetermined.”


	
	In Pantorno v The Queen [1989] HCA 18; (1989) 166 CLR 466; (1989) 38 A Crim R 258 special leave to appeal to the High Court was sought on a ground that had emerged only when the Court of Criminal Appeal had pronounced its judgment. Mason CJ and Brennan J said (166 CLR 466 at 474) –
	


“… Failure to argue a point before a court of criminal appeal presents a considerable obstacle to an applicant who seeks special leave to argue it in this Court. Even if the point emerges clearly only when a court pronounces its judgment, it should be appreciated by counsel who receive judgment that they are under a duty to draw the court's attention to issues which, in the light of the judgment, require further consideration by that court and to move the court to consider any such issues before the formal order of the court is perfected. On occasions, a court of criminal appeal may have to give further consideration to issues which were relegated to the margin of attention during the argument, though it is not required to consider new grounds which counsel abstained from raising on the appeal. In the present case, the failure of counsel to seek further consideration of the natural justice issue once Bridges was overruled by the Full Court is a factor which counts against the grant of special leave. However, as there seems to have been an erroneous view in some sections of the legal profession (now hopefully corrected) that no application can be made to a court of criminal appeal once its judgment is pronounced, it is not a fatal objection to the grant of special leave in this case. In this case, as a denial of natural justice appears from the concession made in this Court, as the point was covered by the grounds of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal and as argument in this Court proceeded upon the tacit assumption that the formal order of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been perfected so that there are now no means of remedying the position save an appeal to this Court, special leave should be granted.”


	
	Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ observed (at 484) that there had been an “inadvertent denial of procedural fairness” by the Court of Criminal Appeal which would ordinarily preferably be dealt with by further application to that Court. Nonetheless, in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295; (1997) 94 A Crim R 397, Dawson and Gaudron JJ made the point (189 CLR 295 at 300) that Grierson was still authority for the proposition that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) did not confer jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which had been heard on the merits and finally determined and, in substance, that the exception in Pantorno applied to the ability of an intermediate court of appeal to entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order had been perfected and did not concern its jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal when the first had been heard and determined on the merits and an order perfected.
	
	
	To return to Reardon, after setting out the relevant passage, Hodgson JA noted the agreement of Gummow J with it (at 327), although contra McHugh J (at 315).
	
	
	After discussing these cases, Hodgson JA, after considering R v Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398, R v McNamara (No 2) (1997) 1 VR 257, R v Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71 and R v Gust [2000] NSWCCA 287, summarised the position as follows –
	


“[40] The authorities make it clear that, if an application to re-open an appeal is made before the judgment dealing with the appeal has been perfected, the Court has jurisdiction to re-open its consideration of the appeal, and that denial of procedural fairness will be a ground on which the Court may take that course. However, the situation is not so clear where the application to re-open is made after the order of the Court has been perfected. Grierson is direct authority to the effect that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to re-open an appeal once it has heard and determined the appeal and the order has been perfected. Jones suggests that this principle might not apply if a purported determination of an appeal in fact does not amount to a determination of the appeal because there has been a total failure to determine some of the grounds of the appeal. Pantorno and Postiglioni suggests the possibility that there might be jurisdiction to re-open an appeal where procedural fairness has been denied. In the Court of Criminal Appeal. R v Lapa suggests that there is no jurisdiction to re-open an appeal once the order is perfected, even where there is a denial of procedural fairness; but it could be said that that view is expressed obiter. The contrary view is expressed in R v Saxon and R v Gust, but again it could be said that the view is expressed obiter.

[41] In my opinion, what was said in Jones, Pantorno and Postiglioni is insufficient to displace the binding authority of Grierson to the effect, once an appeal has been heard and determined and the order perfected, there is no jurisdiction to re-open the appeal. This is subject to the slip rule, and the possibility of separate proceedings to set aside orders obtained by fraud. However, it is to be noted that this principle applies when an appeal has been heard and determined; and leaves open the possibility that if there are grounds of appeal which are not determined at all, it could be said that the appeal has not been determined. That is a possibility adverted to by Sperling J in R v Saxon; but in my opinion, it is not any denial of procedural fairness which would have the result that it could be said that an appeal has not been heard and determined. In my opinion, it is only if there is some ground of appeal which was argued but not determined by the court that one might be able to say that a purported determination does not, in relation to that ground of appeal, amount to a determination of the appeal. Failure to deal with an argument that has been advanced, or deciding an appeal on a basis not properly argued, although possibly amounting to a denial of procedural fairness and thereby to an error of law, could not of itself in my opinion be a failure to determine the appeal such as could avoid the operation of the principle in Grierson. To that extent, I prefer the view expressed in R v Lapa to the contrary view expressed in R v Saxon and R v Gust.”


	
	His Honour concluded that, there having been no amendment sought to the grounds of appeal, the earlier judgment had determined Reardon’s appeal as it then stood. Nor was there any denial of procedural fairness, so that the case was not one in which it could be said that the appeal had not been determined and, accordingly, there was no jurisdiction to reopen it.
	
	
	The passage at [41] in the judgment of Hodgson JA in Reardon was cited with approval in Morgan v Regina (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 80; (2013) A Crim R 483 by Beazley P (Hidden and Harrison JJ agreeing) (at [62]). Morgan was convicted on an indictment containing five counts in respect of different offences and unsuccessfully appealed against his convictions in respect of three of the counts only. The argument in the Court concerned only his convictions on those three counts and counsel for Morgan confirmed that the remaining two counts were not the subject of any appeal. The Court quashed the conviction on the three counts but entered a verdict of acquittal only in respect of one, ordering new trials in respect of the remaining two. Morgan then sought by separate proceedings to appeal against his convictions on the two unconsidered counts (five and six). Morgan’s original notice to appeal referred to all counts on which he had been convicted, although the grounds of appeal did not concern the convictions on counts five and six and, when questioned by the bench, his counsel confirmed that they were not the subject of any appeal. Morgan contended that the Court still had jurisdiction to deal with those two counts because either he had not appealed against those convictions or his appeal in respect of them had been abandoned and the Court could go behind that abandonment. Beazley J concluded (Hidden and Harrison JJ agreeing) that, since only one indictment may be presented for trial, though it may contain a number of counts, there can only be one appeal in respect of the convictions on that indictment (at [73]). Furthermore, the rules as to abandonment of an appeal concern the appeal as a whole, so that, although particular grounds might not be pressed in relation to particular convictions, the rule permitting abandonment does not permit abandonment of an appeal in respect of some of the convictions (at [82]). Accordingly, the fact that an appellant decides not to pursue appeals against some of his or her convictions does not mean that the Court’s determination in respect of the other convictions has not been a determination of the entirety of his right of appeal. Although the unchallenged convictions will not be the subject of a specific order of the Court, they cannot thereafter be separately appealed (at [83]). The consequence was, although the prosecution in effect conceded that (considering the interconnection between the charges in respect of the quashed convictions and the remaining charges) they ought also to be quashed, if there were jurisdiction to do so, that the Court did not have this jurisdiction and the convictions on counts five and six therefore stood.
	
	
	The issue of finality has been considered by the High Court in the context of s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which enables a court to reopen sentence proceedings where the court has “imposed a penalty that is contrary to law”: Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; (2014) 236 A Crim R 427. A Crown appeal to this Court against the inadequacy of sentences was allowed and the sentences increased. Two of the offences were subject to standard non-parole periods and dealt with in a way disapproved by Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, which was decided seven weeks later. The appellant then applied to reopen the appeal under s 43. The Court dismissed the application on the basis that s 43 did not apply to the Muldrock errors which, it was agreed, had occurred. French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ (Gageler J agreeing in somewhat different language) pointed out (at [14ff]) that the power of courts to reopen proceedings and vary orders, absent specific statutory authority, “is constrained by the principle of finality”. Of present relevance is the point made that this principle is the background against which “any statutory provision conferring power upon a court to reopen concluded proceedings is to be considered… [and] is a principle which may inform the construction of the provision” (at [16]). However, “consistently with a principle of finality, courts may correct their errors before their orders are formally recorded” (at [17]), as by application of the slip rule.
	
	
	The first decision of this Court dealing in terms with the construction and application of r 50C (as such) was Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69, in which the applicant sought, within the time limited by the rule, to set aside or vary an order earlier made to dismiss his appeal against conviction. The Court noted, in substance, that r 50C did not change the powers of the Court to vary or set aside orders that applied by virtue of the Criminal Appeal Act (of course, this followed from the former’s subordinate status) but extended the period during which an application for the setting aside or variation could be made (ibid at [4]). The Court went on to state –
	


“6 Where judgment has been given but the order has not been entered, the power to reconsider an appeal is not precluded. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the Court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are quite limited. In Elliott and Blessington at [31]-[32], the High Court held that the criteria by which this Court should determine an application to re-open a proceeding, prior to judgment being entered, were those stated by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303:

‘What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases.’”


	
	The applicant sought to reopen the appeal to call further expert evidence which had been available at the time of trial but gave no explanation as to why that material had not been presented on the appeal. The Court concluded –
	


“[14] As indicated above, this is a clear case of a reopening being proposed in order to enable the applicant to reargue the appeal. If the Court acted under some misapprehension as to the relevant facts at the hearing of the appeal, that was solely due to the manner in which the appellant ran his case. There was no suggestion, it should be added, that experienced counsel who ran the appeal did so otherwise than competently. Nor was it suggested that the Court in some way obstructed the presentation of the appeal.”

It is, perhaps, worth observing that the penultimate sentence of this passage does not suggest an available way of reopening an appeal. The reference to the manner in which the appellant ran his case was made to render it unnecessary to consider whether the asserted misapprehension was capable of correction under r 50C and did not imply that fresh evidence would be sufficient, even if it had been unavailable; the reference to counsel’s competence was simply to note (as a courtesy) it was not suggested otherwise. The last sentence is, as I understand it, a reference to the possibility that the original appeal had gone awry because the proposed ground was prevented by the Court from being raised – which might, in some circumstances, justify reopening (vide Pantorno, infra).


	
	The interpretation of r 50C applied in Alramadan was followed in Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201. The Court allowed the applicant’s appeal against his sentence and he was resentenced accordingly. He made an application under r 50C to vary his sentence, claiming in effect that the Court did not have the grounds for appeal and written submissions he had prepared and filed in advance of the hearing of the appeal but instead had considered the grounds of appeal and written submissions which had been prepared by his former lawyers, both of which he had specifically abandoned when he assumed the conduct of his appeal. In the result, an analysis of the two sets of documents did not disclose any material difference. The Court concluded that none of the issues or grounds pursued by the applicant on the appeal were “overlooked or were the subject of a misapprehension of a kind that enlivens an exercise of the Court’s power under Rule 50C” (ibid at [36]).
	
	
	In R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195; (2010) 79 NSWLR 143; (2010) 242 FLR 64 the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) sought orders for the correction or amendment of the reasons for judgment of Rothman J in R v Jones; R v Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108. Rothman J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed), after a review of a number of cases dealing with the inherent powers of a superior court of record, said –
	


“[38] Plainly, the primary submission of the respondents that the court has no power to alter its reasons for judgment does not withstand scrutiny. The power to alter reasons must be at least as wide as the power to alter the judgment. In other words, there must, at the very least, be a power, in a superior court of record, to alter reasons for judgment to overcome a slip or where the intention of the court has not manifested in the reasons.

[39] Further, the respondents’ submission mistakes the wording of the reasons with the content of the reasons. Whereas the judgment of a court is the expression from which that which may be enforced must be taken, the reasons are the rationale upon which that judgment is based.

[40] Thus, an infelicitous expression may be corrected without effecting an alteration to the reasons. It would simply be an alteration to the wording of the reasons.

[41] As already stated, superior courts alter reasons delivered ex tempore by correcting an infelicitous or injudicious use of language or correcting some grammatical expression. Such an alteration does not alter the reasons for judgment. But the Court is not entitled to alter the wording in a manner inconsistent with the reasons originally issued. Even then, there are exceptions. For example, if a court expressed reasons that mistakenly inserted the word “not”, or omitted it; or mistakenly referred to the “plaintiff” instead of the “applicant”, who or which may be the defendant. Further, a judgment may issue (and be entered) before reasons are published, when urgency requires it and the judge has reserved his reasons: see Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v Lines MacFarlane Marshall Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 167 at [38]-[40], and cases cited therein.”


	
	As initially published, the judgment under consideration stated that the respondents had “cheated on company tax… [having] paid out on false invoices, thereby avoiding GST and income tax, and returned the money to their own personal accounts…” The error was that the reference to GST was a slip for “company”. Rothman J explained that, because the false invoices concerned overseas transactions supplied by an overseas entity, GST was not payable and the “intended wording drew the distinction between a scheme which, if genuine, would not have occasioned the payment of GST (“avoidance”) and the fraudulent evasion of income tax”. In that sense, the reasons for judgment involved a slip and would be amended by inserting “evading” before the words “income tax” in the paragraph (ibid at [53] – [55]). The second alteration concerned language which contradicted the plain intention of the Court to fix a mandatory detention period that was 50 per cent of the total sentence imposed below and no lower. The impugned paragraph did not convey this intention and it was therefore corrected. As Rothman J put it –
	


“[63] Again, the intent of the original reasons has been infelicitously expressed and correcting the wording of the reasons to reflect better the original intent is not altering the basis or rationale of the judgment, as it was originally intended.”

His Honour summed up the position –

“[65] Neither of these alterations involve an alteration to the rationale or basis upon which the appeal was granted and the sentence fixed. As a consequence, the alterations to the wording of the reasons are within power and will be made.”


	
	In other cases, orders specifying dates for sentences and non-parole periods did not reflect the intention of the Court as demonstrated in the reasons and corrections were made: see Buadromo v R (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 55; R v AB (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256; Akkawi v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72; Martin v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 26; R v Green; R v Quinn [2011] NSWCCA 71; Yeonata v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 59; KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84; R v Ly (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	In PFC v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 241 the applicant, relying in part upon what he said was fresh evidence, in substance attacked the whole of the reasoning and findings of the Court which dismissed his appeal. The application was refused upon the basis that such an exercise was not permitted under r 50C or, for that matter, by the inherent powers of the Court.
	
	
	Mr Miller submitted that his contention that this Court had jurisdiction to consider his application was supported by Cooley v The State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 160; (2005) 155 A Crim R 528 (the principal judgment of 19 August 2005); BC200507376 (the supplementary judgment of 28 September 2005) in which the appellant had appealed from his conviction of wilful murder under the Criminal Code (WA). In that case, a ground of appeal alleged that a doctor to whom the appellant had allegedly made a confession of an intention to kill the deceased had been discredited after the trial by the Medical Registration Board and question marks were therefore raised about his credibility. This ground was struck out at a directions hearing prior to the hearing of the appeal because the adverse findings of the Board had by then been quashed on appeal to the Supreme Court. As it happened, the decision by the Board had in fact occurred prior to and not after the trial. At the hearing of the appeal, the applicant’s counsel sought to have the ground reinstated upon the basis that the Crown would or should have known of the Board’s findings and failed to disclose them to the defence, which was unaware of publicity in the media about them. The applicant argued that he was denied the opportunity of challenging the doctor’s credibility based upon the (albeit reversed) adverse findings. Granting leave to reinstate the ground (with adjustments to fit the correct chronology), the Court held that, although the findings were neither new nor fresh (since they were in the public domain and would have been revealed by reasonable inquiry), the Crown should nevertheless have informed the defence about them, which would have enabled the doctor to be cross-examined on the Board’s findings against him and, if necessary, proved and given rise to a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the doctor’s evidence ([2005] WASCA 160; (2005) 155 A Crim R 528 at [66]). Accordingly, this amounted to a miscarriage of justice and the ground was upheld, though it was mistakenly framed. However, the ability to cross-examine on the Board’s findings was available only because, at that time, the doctor’s appeal to the Supreme Court had not been determined. His appeal succeeded so that, as Roberts-Smith JA (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) pointed out (ibid at [70]) he could not at any new trial be cross examined on the reversed findings and counsel would have been in the same position as in fact he was in the original trial. It followed that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred and the appeal was dismissed pursuant to the proviso in s 30(4) of the Criminal Appeals Act 2004 (WA).
	
	
	Several days after delivery of the principal judgment, counsel for the Crown wrote to the Court disclosing that, in fact, there had been no failure by the Crown to disclose the decision of the Board, the prosecutor being aware that defence counsel had read its findings. It followed that counsel had made a conscious decision in all the circumstances not to cross-examine the doctor about the matter. This was confirmed shortly after by counsel for the defence at trial. In light of these developments, both counsel agreed to a suggestion by the Court that the matter should be relisted and an order made that relevant parts of the reasons for judgment be recalled and corrected. At this time, the orders following delivery of the reasons had not been perfected.
	
	
	In his Honour’s supplementary judgment, Roberts-Smith JA, having pointed out that the Court had an inherent jurisdiction to set an order aside without necessitating an appeal where there had been a denial of procedural fairness, went on to say (omitting references) –
	


“[15] This is not a case in which a party was deprived of a right to be heard, so giving rise in the absence of injustice to the other party, to a need to exercise the inherent jurisdiction to set aside a judgment or order... This is rather an occasion to exercise the inherent jurisdiction to remedy an injustice in the nature of an incorrect finding based upon a wrong statement of facts, inadvertently asserted by counsel for the applicant and not at the time corrected by counsel for the respondent… The power exists in respect of judgments which have not been drawn up, including those of appeal courts ….

[16] Here the order to be recalled is that the applicant be granted leave to reinstate… [the ground that had been excluded by directions made before the hearing]. The reasons for judgment can be recalled to correct obvious or agreed errors…

[17] The factual error here was significant. Leave to re-open will more readily be given where that is so, even after judgment… The assertion was that the Board's finding adversely to [the doctor] and the reasons for it, were not known to the applicant's counsel at trial and were not disclosed to him by the prosecution and that he was thereby denied an opportunity to cross-examine… [the doctor] on that. The applicant now accepts that trial counsel, to the knowledge of the prosecutor, was at all relevant times fully aware of that information and with that in mind, made a deliberate forensic decision not to cross-examine the doctor on it.

[18] The circumstances in which the assertion was made in the course of oral argument and without the point having previously been raised, gave counsel for the respondent (who was not trial counsel) no opportunity to check the fact and respond to the submission in any informed way, although that was not appreciated at the time because both the Court and counsel naturally were prepared to accept the assertion of fact implied or made by counsel for the applicant. The Court was accordingly deprived of the benefit of a correct explanation of the facts and submissions based on that.

[19] For these reasons and given the importance of the factual error and the finding based upon it, we indicated we would recall our earlier order and reasons and make an appropriate amendment to them.

[20] In light of this unfortunate course of events and the erroneous factual basis upon which a finding was (thereby unjustly) made adversely to the respondent, it is appropriate that my judgment… be recalled to the limited extent necessary to correct that.”

Accordingly, the passage in the judgment on appeal that made what amounted to criticism of the Crown prosecutor was removed, the true position stated and the order granting leave to reinstate the impugned ground was varied to refuse that leave.


	
	It is clear that Cooley does not support the applicant’s contentions in any way: the order varied was interlocutory; the error was agreed; no evaluation of evidence was required; and there was no possibility of impact on the outcome of the appeal.
	
	
	Though it is a civil case, Bastow v Bagley & Co. Limited (1961) 1 WLR 1494; [1961] 3 All ER 1101, also relied on by the applicant, provides somewhat greater support for his contention as to the width of the jurisdiction. In that case the plaintiff was awarded 1,150 pounds in general damages for the loss of sight in his right eye but, being guilty of contributory negligence, his damages were reduced by half. He appealed solely on the quantum of damages. Sellers LJ (with whom Upjohn and Diplock LJJ agreed) said that the award was less than he himself would have been given but it was the assessment of an experienced judge and the amount was not so small as to justify interference. Sometime after judgment had been given but before it had been entered, another division of the Court of Appeal heard and determined an appeal concerning the loss of an eye with broadly similar consequences to those affecting the appellant. In that case, the damages awarded by the trial judge were so low as to clearly require intervention. The Court reassessed damages and awarded 2,000 pounds. Although its judgment in Mr Bastow’s case had been delivered, it was recalled. Sellers LJ said that, given that the judges in the other division had assessed the damages in their case at 2,000, the disparity between that and Mr Bastow’s award “is too great to be just and fair to the plaintiff in all the circumstances”. Accordingly, the appeal was then allowed and the assessment of damages increased. Diplock LJ pointed out that damages for the loss of the sight of an eye are essentially incommensurable and the “choice of the right order of figure is empirical and, in practice, results from a general consensus of opinion of… juries, judges and appellate courts”. However, the sum awarded to one victim “should not be out of all proportion to the sum awarded to another in respect of similar physical injuries” and, therefore, the appeal should be allowed.
	
	
	On the face of it, this would appear to be inconsistent with the position as to correcting judgments and orders as it is in Australia. There is no discussion of principle. It is a civil case. I do not regard it as shedding any light on the jurisdictional issues in this case.
	


Consideration


	
	Rule 50C does not deal with the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction to reconsider and correct either its orders or its reasoning. It merely deals with the time frame in which such a jurisdiction may be exercised. It does not, in terms, deal with the possibility of reconsideration or variation after the time limits have expired, but reserves the general jurisdiction of the Court in this respect by sub rule (4). In the nature of things, the character and extent of the jurisdiction cannot be the subject of bright line distinctions: it is a matter of fact and degree. The fundamental rule is that there is no jurisdiction to rehear an appeal once determined, even before actual or constructive entry of judgment, though in certain circumstances particular issues might justify reconsideration, as where there is a misapprehension of fact or law, or a ground of appeal, necessary to final disposal of the appeal, has been overlooked or mistakenly not determined or there has been a denial of procedural fairness in the hearing of the appeal. It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of examples but it is clear that there is no jurisdiction to revisit the orders or reasons where the contended misapprehension is merely an assertion that a conclusion made following consideration of the matter by the Court is wrong, let alone where the applicant seeks, in effect, to argue a new ground of appeal. In short, the unsuccessful appellant cannot, in the language of Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; (1993) 176 CLR 300 (quoted above) have a backdoor appeal.
	
	
	After judgment has been entered, nothing of substance can be changed, though this still permits changes to orders or reasons where the language of either mistakenly does not reflect the order contemplated by the reasons or the sense of the reasons themselves. It must follow that no second appeal can be had on the merits, still less can a subsequent Court of Criminal Appeal hear such an appeal from an earlier decision of the Court. The mere contention that some error of law or misapprehension of fact has affected the decision is immaterial. If what is sought is, in effect, a rehearing on the merits of a decided appeal by this Court, the only recourse is by way of further appeal, if special leave is granted.
	
	
	As a useful guide, any application before the orders are perfected which requires more than a summary consideration and determination of the impugned judgment or order is likely to be outside the scope of the rule.
	
	
	I return to the application here. However wide the grey area might be, it is clear enough from what has already been discussed that the applicant’s case is a wholesale attack upon the earlier judgment of this Court and would require, for its redetermination, much the same task as that Court undertook in dealing with the grounds of appeal before it. Such an exercise is plainly not contemplated by the rule and, by a very substantial margin, is well outside the inherent power of the Court to make corrections or clarifications.
	
	
	Turning to particular matters, although the applicant in his appeal raised in general terms the complaint that documents had become available to him after the trial which, if they had been produced earlier, would have assisted his defence, this ground did not concern, let alone specify, the Mavis Bannister file but involved documents of a different kind, some of which he had in his possession at all times and others which he could not prove were genuine. As mentioned, as to this ground the Court ruled that the applicant had not established that the posited fresh or new evidence was indeed fresh or new or credible. As the Crown points out, since the applicant did not raise an issue as to production of the Mavis Bannister file as a ground of appeal (although he was aware of it at the time), it follows that there could be no misapprehension of fact about it.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the asserted oversight of the complaint about the “Mavis Bannister” file. The submissions made about it in the appeal did not call for consideration or determination. At all events, the issue could not now be considered as sought by the applicant. Its significance or otherwise could only be assessed by a close analysis of the whole of the evidence going to the issue of the applicant’s alleged professional position, a task which this Court cannot undertake on an application of this kind. I should mention for completeness, that on the basis of the applicant’s explanation of its character, its actual importance appears to be, if relevant, trivial: the fact, if true, that he referred a client to the actual Mr Miller, solicitor, does not suggest, let alone prove, that he did not pretend to be a solicitor, which was the gravamen of the offence of which he was convicted.
	
	
	The other grounds should be summarily dismissed. As to ground three (Detective Hetherington’s investigation), it is patent that such a ground cannot be the subject of an application under r 50C, nor the inherent powers of the Court. If it were properly particularised – which it was not – it could (or, more precisely, might) possibly be a ground of a substantive appeal but that is what the applicant cannot now have. Ground four (claimed unreasonable verdict) is also obviously impossible. Ground five (claimed misdirections) should have been raised in time and cannot now be put.
	
	
	The applicant has filed three notices of motion. The first, dated 31 March 2014 sought, as I have mentioned, the reopening of the appeal, review of the refusal to grant bail and disqualification of the judges. For the foregoing reasons, the first of these prayers must be rejected. As to bail, the application was not before the Court as presently constituted in an appropriate way (and, in light of the dismissal of the then pending appeal, is now irrelevant), whilst the disqualification application was not pressed. The second notice of motion, dated 21 August 2014 sought an order for production of police records and that Detective Hetherington appear to give evidence in connection with the application. (Other orders were sought but have been overtaken by events.) The third notice of motion is dated 24 March 2015, again seeking an order for the production of certain police and ODPP records. (Disqualification of all the Justices of the Court was also sought but, again, not pressed.) At the hearing of the appeal, the applicant submitted that he wanted the orders relating to the production of documents and the presence of the police officer determined before dealing with the application itself. After hearing submissions from him which, in substance, conceded that this was further material in support of the argument that, in dealing with his appeal, the Court overlooked, misapprehended or otherwise was mistaken about his fresh evidence ground, the Court ruled that leave to produce further material would not be granted nor would the attendance of witnesses be required. The reason given at the time is that such evidence and such material of its very nature is contrary to the Court’s jurisdiction under r 50C. That is not to say that in no case could additional evidence be led (for example, gaol records where there had been an error about the dates of sentences and the like) but, for the reasons already given, documents or evidence sought for the purpose of arguing a substantive ground of appeal cannot be admitted and, therefore, cannot be required to be produced.
	


Conclusion


	
	The application should be dismissed.

		05 August 2015",2015-08-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702982,Lin v R [2015] NSWCCA 204,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the applicant, Heng-Sheng Lin, seeks leave to appeal against an interlocutory decision of Judge Hoy in the District Court of 16 October 2014, dismissing a notice of motion pursuant to which the applicant sought that an indictment presented against him be “stayed or quashed”.
	


Background


	
	By the indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (“the Director”) charged the applicant with five counts of offences against s 400.9 of the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the Code”). Section 400.9 is set out in full below. Put shortly, sub-s (1) creates an offence of dealing with money or other property which, it was reasonable to suspect, was the proceeds of crime, and was of a value of $100,000 or more.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to go into the facts alleged by the Director in any detail. He alleges that, on five occasions between 16 May 2013 and 12 September 2013, the applicant made arrangements to transfer money from Australia to a Hong Kong bank account. On each occasion, the amount in question exceeded $100,000. The total amount involved in the transactions was $2,845,000. Subsequently, when questioned by Federal Police, the applicant claimed that the money belonged to a person he knew only as “Peter”, for whom he did not have any contact details. The Director alleges that the amount involved is grossly out of proportion to the applicant’s income and expenditure over the period during which the transactions occurred. (The facts asserted in the preceding two sentences have a significance that will emerge in due course.)
	
	
	The basis for the application for stay of the indictment is what is asserted to be the refusal of the Director to provide certain particulars sought on behalf of the applicant. On 16 September 2014 solicitors acting for the applicant wrote to the Director, seeking identified particulars of the indictment. Specifically, they asked:
	


“1.  In respect of each of the counts, what indictable offence(s) against the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory or a foreign country is it alleged from which the money the subject of each of the counts was, in whole or in part, derived or realised?”

The solicitors went on to express the view that without the provision of proper particulars, the indictment was defective and the trial would be unable to proceed.


	
	By letter dated 29 September, the Director replied:
	


“The Crown alleges that the money the subject of each count is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. Proceeds of crime is relevantly defined by s 400.1 of the Criminal Code 1995 to mean any money that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence.

…

It is the Crown position that the physical element of s 400.9(1)(b) does not require particularisation of a predicate offence, rather if any particularisation is required at all it is particularisation as to which deeming provision pursuant to s 400.9(2) is relied upon, noting that they are not exhaustive. For instance, the Crown also relies upon the fact that the accused declared on his incoming passenger card on 9 May 2013, 29 August 2013, 4 September 2013 and 12 September 2013 that he was not carrying in excess of AUD10,000 into the country, in addition to the deeming provisions set out in s 400.9(2)(c) and (e):

(c)  the value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant’s income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs;

…

(e)  the defendant:

(i)  has stated that the conduct was engaged in on behalf of or at the request of another person; and

(ii)  has not provided information enabling the other person to be identified and located.

In light of the above, it is the Crown view that the indictment is not defective, and the Crown intends to proceed on the filed indictment.”

Relevant legislation


	
	Section 400.9 appears in Ch 10 of the Code, under the general heading “National Infrastructure”. Part 10.2 is entitled “Money laundering”, as is Div 400.
	
	
	Section 400.1 contains a series of definitions, of which those relevant to the present proceeding are:
	


“proceeds of crime means any money or other property that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)”; and

“instrument of crime: money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).”


	
	By s 4G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) offences against laws of the Commonwealth punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more are indictable offences. (The states, territories, and foreign countries make their own provisions concerning offences that are indictable.)
	
	
	Section 400.2 of the Code defines “deals with money or other property” in the following way:
	


“A person deals with money or other property if the person does any of the following:

(a)  receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property;

(b)  imports money or other property into Australia;

(c)  exports money or other property from Australia;

(d)  engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property.”


	
	Sections 400.3 to 400.8 create offences of dealing in money or other property that is the proceeds of crime or that will become an instrument of crime. Penalties for the various offences vary according to the threshold value of the money or property specified in the provisions (ranging from $1,000,000 in s 400.3 to any value in s 400.8). They also vary according to the mental element (ranging from belief to recklessness to negligence). A more complete analysis of the offences created by these sections may be found in Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 at [11]-[15] and [55]. In each case, identification of the class of indictable offences from which the money or property is alleged to have been derived or realised (proceeds of crime) or as to which it is intended, or is alleged to be at risk of, being used in the commission or facilitation of (instrument of crime) is necessary: see Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205; 83 NSWLR 224 at [28]. It is not necessary that the Crown identify a particular offence, or the commission of an offence by a particular person: s 400.13.
	
	
	Section 400.9 creates an offence of a different character from those created by the preceding sections. Section 400.9 is as follows:
	


“400.9  Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime etc.

(1)  A person commits an offence if:

(a)  the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)  it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c)  at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.

Penalty:  Imprisonment for 3 years, or 180 penalty units, or both.

(1A)  A person commits an offence if:

(a)  the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)  it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c)  at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is less than $100,000.

Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years, or 120 penalty units, or both.

(2)  Without limiting paragraph (1)(b) or (1A)(b), that paragraph is taken to be satisfied if:

(a)  the conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(a) involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or

(aa)  the conduct involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or

(b)  the conduct involves using one or more accounts held with ADIs in false names; or

(ba)  the conduct amounts to an offence against section 139, 140 or 141 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006; or

(c)  the value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant’s income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs; or

(d)  the conduct involves a significant cash transaction within the meaning of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, and the defendant:

(i)  has contravened his or her obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or

(ii)  has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

(da)  the conduct involves a threshold transaction (within the meaning of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006) and the defendant:

(i)  has contravened the defendant's obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or

(ii)  has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

(e)  the defendant:

(i)  has stated that the conduct was engaged in on behalf of or at the request of another person; and

(ii)  has not provided information enabling the other person to be identified and located.

(4)  Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) and (1A)(b) and (c).

(5)  This section does not apply if the defendant proves that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money or property was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from some form of unlawful activity.

Note:  A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5) (see section 13.4).”


	
	Sections 400.10 to 400.12, and 400.14 to 400.16 contain provisions not material to the present application. Section 400.13 provides as follows:
	


“400.13  Proof of other offences is not required

(1)  To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division that money or property is proceeds of crime, to establish:

(a)  a particular offence was committed in relation to the money or property; or

(b)  a particular person committed an offence in relation to the money or property.

(2)  To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that:

(a)  an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or

(b)  an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property.”


	
	Section 400.9(1) differs from the preceding six sections in two material respects. The first is that it does not contemplate proof of the actual commission of an indictable offence; to prove the offence it is sufficient that the prosecution prove a dealing with money or property which it is reasonable to suspect is the proceeds of an indictable offence that has been committed. The second distinguishing feature is that s 400.9 contains no equivalent of an offence constituted by dealing in money or property that is intended to be, or is at risk of being, an instrument of crime - that is, an indictable offence that it is intended will be committed, or as to which there is a risk that it will be committed, in the future.
	
	
	On its own, therefore, s 400.9(1) would create an offence only of dealing with money or property which it is reasonable to suspect is “wholly or partly derived or realised directly or indirectly” by the past or completed commission of an indictable offence and which is to the value of $100,000 or more. It is important to note the words “derived or realised”.
	
	
	There are three elements (see the Code, s 4.1) of an offence against s 400.9:
	


(i)  dealing in money or other property;

(ii)  which it is reasonable to suspect is the proceeds of crime; and

(iii)  the money or property is to the value of $100,000 or more.

For a conviction under the section, each must be proved to the criminal standard.


	
	For present purposes, it may be assumed that the Director can prove that, on the five occasions the subject of the charges, the applicant dealt with money to the value of more than $100,000. What is in issue is what he has to prove in order to prove the element contained in s 400.9(1)(b): that it is reasonable to suspect that that money was the “proceeds of crime”. More precisely, what is presently in issue is what the Director is obliged to particularise as to his case in respect of that element.
	


The contentions of the parties


	
	The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was the argument that had been advanced in the correspondence seeking particulars and before Hoy DCJ. The underlying proposition is that, in order to prove a charge under s 400.9(1), the Director must identify the indictable offence of which he asserts it is reasonable to suspect that the money was the proceeds. The argument was that, when charging under s 400.9, the Director is under an obligation to particularise the indictable offence(s) of which he alleges the money or property could reasonably be suspected of being the proceeds. The argument depended upon the definition of “proceeds of crime”, and the use of that term in s 400.9(1)(b). On the hearing, this submission was modified to assert that what was essential was identification of a class of indictable offences of which the Director alleged that the money or property could reasonably be suspecting of being the proceeds. Senior counsel, however, maintained a submission, by reference to the definition, that money or property “can constitute ‘proceeds of crime’ only where it is derived [or realised] from an indictable offence”. Further, he submitted that the words “taken to be satisfied” in sub-s (2) “relate only to the reasonableness of the suspicion required by sub-s (1)(b)”.
	
	
	The Director’s contention, also as outlined in the correspondence, was that, by reason of s 400.9(2), he was not obliged to particularise an indictable offence.
	
	
	Sub-section (2) spells out a number of circumstances that, if proved, will be taken to satisfy the requirements of sub-s (1)(b) - that it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is the proceeds of crime. I take the Director’s argument to be that sub-s (2) specifies circumstances that are deemed to be indictable offences, and that the circumstances spelled out in pars (c) and (e) of sub-s (2) are the “deemed indictable offences” from which he alleges the money the subject of the five charges on the indictment was derived or realised.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant sought to draw support for his argument by pointing to those pars of sub-s (2) that identify, as sufficient to be taken to satisfy par (1)(b), conduct that would itself constitute an indictable offence - for example, the conduct specified in par 2(a), constitutes a structuring offence under the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth). The Director’s construction would, he contended, lead to absurdity, because a person dealing in money or property could be guilty of two offences (with different penalties) arising out of the same conduct.
	


Resolution


	
	The appellant’s arguments cannot be accepted.
	
	
	What sub-s (2) does is expand the ambit of sub-s (1)(b) by providing that the physical element provided by that paragraph - that is, that it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is the proceeds of crime - is satisfied by proof of conduct of the various kinds specified. In other words, par (1)(b) is satisfied if the Director proves any of the kinds of conduct specified in the various paragraphs of sub-s (2).
	
	
	That conduct is additional to conduct constituting an indictable offence from which the money (or property) is derived or realised. That is sub-s (2) provides an alternative route to proof of the “reasonable to suspect” element of the offence. By reason of sub-s (2), the Director is not obliged to prove that the money or property is derived or realised from an indictable offence; it is sufficient if he proves that it involves conduct of the kind specified. For example, sub-s (2)(a) provides that sub-s (1)(b) is taken to be satisfied if the dealing involves a number of transactions that amount to an offence of “structuring” within the meaning of the Financial Transactions Reports Act. Structuring offences are, by s 31 of that Act, indictable offences; but they are not offences from which money or property is derived or realised. Without the provisions of s 400.9(2)(a), it could not be said that money used in a structuring offence was derived or realised from the commission of an indictable offence and thus was the “proceeds of crime”. Such conduct would not come within s 400.9(1).
	
	
	Section 400.9(2)(a) thus expands the operation of s 400.9(1). The same reasoning applies to pars (aa), (b), (ba), (d) and (da): in each case, the conduct referred to is conduct that does, or might, in conjunction with other conduct, amount to an indictable offence; but it is not an indictable offence from which the money or property the subject of the asserted dealing could be said to have been derived or realised. Accordingly, those paragraphs also expand the operation of s 400.9(1)(b).
	
	
	Similarly, the two paragraphs to which specific reference was made in response to the request for particulars, par (2)(c), and par (2)(e) (which do not, of themselves or in conjunction with other conduct, constitute indictable offences), expand the operation of s 400.9(1)(b) to encompass dealing in money or property grossly disproportionate to the defendant’s income and expenditure over a reasonable period within which the conduct occurs (par (c)), and dealing in property in circumstances where the defendant has stated that the dealings were engaged in on behalf of or at the request of another person, and has failed to provide relevant information concerning that person (par (e)).
	
	
	This reasoning demonstrates that the purpose of s 400.9(2) is to expand the operation of s 400.9(1)(b) in order to encompass conduct that does not fall within the definition of “proceeds of crime”. It is therefore inappropriate to require the Director to identify a “predicate” indictable offence the subject of the charge. When sub-s (2) is invoked, a “predicate” offence is not required. Any one or more of the circumstances specified in sub-s (2) is sufficient to prove the element of a s 400.9 offence required by sub-s (1)(b). That is what the Director is obliged to particularise. And it is simply incorrect to characterise the words “taken to be satisfied” in sub-s (2) as directed to the reasonableness of the suspicion required by sub-s (1)(b); the language is inapt to convey such a meaning.
	
	
	Further, I have no difficulty with the proposition that the same conduct might amount to offences against two different statutory provisions. The criminal law is well able to deal with any unfairness that might result, by requiring the prosecution to elect as to the offence to be prosecuted or, in the event of conviction, in sentencing (the totality principle being well established).
	
	
	The applicant’s argument must therefore fail.
	
	
	Since the question raised by the application has been determined on its merits, leave should be granted to the applicant to appeal under s 5F(3)(a); however, the appeal should be dismissed. I propose the following orders:
	


(1)  Leave granted to appeal;

(2)  Appeal dismissed.


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Simpson J.

		03 August 2015",2015-08-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702985,Czako v R [2015] NSWCCA 202,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: Tamas Czako was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing one count of participation in a criminal group contrary to s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of money laundering contrary to s 193B(2) of the Act. He pleaded not guilty to each count and was tried before Tupman DCJ with a jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of each count. This is an appeal against those convictions.
	
	
	The applicant relies on nine grounds of appeal, rehearsing many of the issues contested at trial. Some of the grounds involve questions of fact and leave is required in respect of those grounds: s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on 17 May 2013 to terms of imprisonment of 18 months on count one and two years on count two. Each sentence was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The applicant is a Hungarian national and was in Australia on a temporary visa. Upon his conviction, he was required to leave Australia and has returned to Hungary.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the applicant participated in a criminal group that was involved in the sale, for profit, of substantial quantities of heroin and cocaine. It was alleged that the leader of the group was Csaba Magyari, a long term friend of the applicant. Magyari was arrested before the applicant. He committed suicide in custody within months after his arrest (T227.35; that evidence was not before the jury). The other alleged members of the group were Gabriella Suto (who pleaded guilty and gave evidence against the applicant), Lilla Toemoeskoezy, Mate Bodo, Laszlo Bartos, Christian Cuzman and George Bucataru. Bartos lived in Brisbane, while Cuzman and Bucataru lived in Adelaide. All other members of the group were based in Sydney.
	
	
	The applicant was alleged to have participated in the group in three ways:
	



	
	by assisting with the installation and operation of surveillance equipment at a unit in Drummoyne where Magyari lived and at premises in Bexley alleged to have been used as a drug “safe house”;
	
	
	by transferring money from his own bank accounts to an account of Magyari’s in Hungary. There were three transfers made over several days, as follows:
	



	
	$9900 on 8 April 2010;
	
	
	$9970 on 9 April 2010; and
	
	
	$9910 on 13 April 2010.
	



	
	by accompanying Toemoeskoezy to a number of different banks when she withdrew a total of around $95,000 in cash after Magyari was arrested.
	



	
	The proceeds of crime charge was based on the applicant’s dealing with the funds the subject of the three transfers identified as the second act of participation above. For that reason, the judge suggested to the jury that it would be “a good idea” to address that count first. The applicant’s grounds of appeal follow the same logic, addressing count 2 first.
	
	
	The detail of the evidence is addressed below as appropriate in the consideration of each ground of appeal.
	


Ground One


	
	Ground one is:
	


The trial miscarried due to the fact that by the end of the trial the Crown was unable to prove a vital element of its case against the [applicant] pertaining to count 2 on the indictment, which was brought pursuant to s 193B(2) Crimes Act, 1900. In such circumstances the jury ought to have acquitted the [applicant].


	
	As submitted by the Crown, this ground evidently seeks to invoke the power of the Court to set aside a jury’s verdict because it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence: s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The applicant’s written submissions contend that, by the end of the trial, the Crown had “resiled from” his position in opening to the jury as to part of the conduct said to sustain the Crown case but the appeal was not argued on the basis of any alleged unfairness on that account.
	
	
	The approach to be adopted by this Court in determining a ground that the verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence has been clearly stated in the decisions of the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 and SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 and need not be repeated here. Adopting the approach stated in those cases, the critical task is to determine “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”: Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] per Hayne J; Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing at [1] and [117] (emphasis in original).
	
	
	The focus of this ground as expanded in the applicant’s submissions is the element required to be proved by the Crown that the funds dealt with by the applicant were in fact proceeds of crime within the meaning of s 193B(2).
	
	
	Section 193B(2) of the Crimes Act provides:
	


“A person who deals with proceeds of crime knowing that it is proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence”.


	
	The term “proceeds of crime” is defined in s 193A to mean any property that is substantially derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of a serious offence. The judge directed the jury that the offences relied upon by the Crown (of dealing in substantial quantities of heroin and cocaine) were serious offences.
	
	
	The Crown opened (at T70.20 to 71.5) that two separate kinds of conduct would establish the money laundering offence: the three transfers to Magyari’s Hungarian account and, separately, the applicant’s attendance with Toemoeskoezy when she withdrew substantial amounts from her bank accounts after Magyari’s arrest. Ultimately, however, the case was left to the jury only on the strength of the three electronic transfers to Magyari’s account.
	
	
	As already noted (and without derogating from the comprehensive treatment of this ground in the applicant’s written submissions), the burden of the argument is that the evidence could not support proof of the second element of the offence, that the funds transferred by the applicant to Magyari in the three electronic transfers were proceeds of crime. It was not disputed that the applicant dealt with those funds and no separate submissions were directed to the element of knowledge.
	
	
	The applicant relied on an exchange between the trial judge and the Crown prosecutor (in the absence of the jury) during which her Honour pressed the Crown as to the evidence on that element. At the conclusion of that exchange, the judge indicated that she proposed to make a comment to the jury on that issue. Her Honour did so, in strong and careful terms. The complete address on the issue appears at SU20.9 to 24.6. After directing the jury that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt as the second element of the offence that the funds of $29,780 transferred in the three transfers were in fact the proceeds of crime, her Honour said:
	


You might think you will look in vain for anything in the Crown case that assists you directly in relation to this element, apart from the fact that these funds were in the account of the accused and were, on the evidence of the accused himself, paid to him by Magyari.


	
	In the remarks that followed, the judge emphasised that the only direct evidence in the trial as to the source of the money transferred by the applicant to Magyari came from the applicant himself, in his evidence in chief. The impression gleaned from the remarks as a whole is that the jury would have been left in no doubt as to the lack of any direct evidence on that issue and the need to approach that element with care, in accordance with the principles applicable to a circumstantial case (as to which her Honour also gave careful directions).
	
	
	The fact that the judge considered it appropriate to make a comment to the jury, while warranting proper attention in this Court, should not be regarded as determinative. The judge’s role was of course quite different from that of the jury. A primary obligation of the judge was to ensure a fair trial; it was no doubt in discharge of that important function that her Honour chose to comment on the issue. Her Honour’s remarks carefully delineated the nature of the task raised by the evidence. In effect, on the Crown case as it stood at the end of the trial, proof of this element required the jury to accept that any money Magyari gave to the applicant was derived wholly or substantially from the commission of a serious offence (as the judge remarked at SU 24.2).
	
	
	It nonetheless remained a matter for the jury to decide, in the light of all the material before them, whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the funds transferred were proceeds of crime. It would be wrong for this Court to approach a ground alleging an unreasonable or unsupportable verdict on the premise that the jury was obliged to capitulate to the judge’s remarks; nor is this Court so obliged. As has been clearly stated by the High Court, the question raised by this ground is a question of fact which the Court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence: M v R at 492-493.
	
	
	On the strength of my assessment of the evidence, in my view it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the funds transferred by the applicant to Magyari were proceeds of crime. There may have been a certain logic in the approach commended by the trial judge of considering count 2 first, but that count was by no means uninformed by the evidence in support of count 1.  
	
	
	There was overwhelming evidence to support the conclusion that Magyari was running a well-organised criminal group which dealt in substantial quantities of prohibited drugs and made large amounts of money. He had been under police surveillance since March 2010 (T151.26). He had a safe house at Bexley (evidently devoted entirely to the storage of drugs), protected by the surveillance system allegedly installed by the applicant; whether or not that was established, it was at least clear that the applicant had assisted Magyari with its operation. That assistance was captured on intercepted telephone conversations (telephone intercepts no 1, exhibit G).
	
	
	The applicant accepted in evidence that he had been to the Bexley safe house (T452.45). The appearance of those premises is revealed in a number of the photographs tendered in evidence in exhibit K. Having regard to what is depicted in those photographs, it would be open to regard the applicant’s denial of any knowledge of Magyari’s drug dealing with scepticism.
	
	
	The applicant was Magyari’s childhood friend. In his evidence, he described their relationship as very close, “as if we were brothers” (T448.44). He had come to Australia “many times” to spend time with Magyari and other members of the Hungarian community. During his most recent (longer) trip he had spent most days with Magyari. He stayed rent-free in an apartment owned by Magyari. He did not obtain any employment in Australia and was completely supported financially by Magyari (T458, 462-463). He had opened the Westpac account (from which the funds were transferred) during a previous visit when Magyari had given him thousands of dollars in cash (T458). He said that money remained in the account until his subsequent (final) visit. There was no plausible, innocent explanation for his receiving such funds.
	
	
	The applicant, in turn, provided assistance to Magyari during that time (T451). The fact of some assistance was admitted; what was in dispute was whether the applicant knew, with all his intimate involvement with the man, that Magyari was heading up a criminal group.
	
	
	Turning specifically to the money laundering offence, on the applicant’s own evidence it was clear that he received large sums of money from Magyari which he regarded as Magyari’s and which he dealt with in accordance with Magyari’s instructions. That itself was a circumstance suggesting the money he received was proceeds of crime, although plainly not capable on its own of proving that element.
	
	
	There was the additional fact that the transfers themselves appeared to have been structured so as to avoid monitoring by authorities. Each transfer was in an amount just under $10,000. There was evidence in the trial from a banker that AUSTRACK monitors transactions exceeding $10,000 for money laundering type payments (T378.25). A notepad located by police during the search of the applicant’s home had the word “Oztrack” written on the bottom of one page. The applicant was not asked specifically about that particular entry, but admitted that generally it was his writing.
	
	
	The applicant denied knowing that the transfer of an amount in excess of $10,000 might alert authorities to possible money laundering activities and denied having any suspicion about the source of the money. He said he transferred those amounts because Magyari told him to (T471). That evidence was inherently implausible and, while it is difficult to gauge from the transcript of evidence given through an interpreter, seems likely to have been unpersuasive.
	
	
	The applicant submitted in this Court that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to whether the funds were proceeds of crime because the bulk of the money in the account had been received by the applicant (from Magyari) before the dates alleged in the indictment. It does not follow that those funds could not have been proceeds of crime. The dates in the indictment identify the range within which it is alleged the applicant dealt with the funds (by transferring them to Hungary for Magyari). It would be an offence, today, to deal with the proceeds of the great train robbery (with the requisite knowledge).
	
	
	There was no independent evidence to suggest Magyari had any source of income other than the drug trade or that any cash he ever gave the applicant could have come from any other source. The applicant gave evidence as to his belief that Magyari had worked but, in the circumstances, the jury was not obliged to entertain a doubt on that account. In my view it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any money the applicant received from Magyari was proceeds of crime within the meaning of the statute.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that ground one is made out.
	


Ground Two


	
	Ground two is:
	


…the trial judge erred in her directions to the jury concerning what the Crown needed to prove in relation count one in the indictment.


	
	The alleged misdirection (which ought to have been specified in the ground of appeal) was that the Crown did not have to prove that the applicant knew every single member of the group. The Crown case was that there was a criminal group consisting of the seven people identified above. Magyari was alleged to be the leader. Toemoeskoezy was his ex-girlfriend. She was alleged to have been involved by laundering money through her bank account. Cuzman and Bucataru (known as “the fat gypsy” and “the thin gypsy”) lived in Adelaide and were alleged to be customers of Magyari, receiving large quantities of drugs for on-sale. They came under police notice due to the interception by police of Magyari’s telephone conversations (T216.46). Suto and Bodo were each alleged to have done a drug run to the two gypsies in Adelaide. Bodo’s run resulted in his arrest (T322), which brought the investigation to a head. Magyari’s flat was searched within hours afterwards and Magyari was arrested at that point. Bartos lived in Queensland and was also alleged to be a customer of Magyari. The applicant knew Magyari, Toemoeskoezy, Bartos, Suto and Bodo but not Cuzman and Bucataru (T453). As to the five he knew, he denied knowing that any was involved in any criminal activity, let alone as a group with the relevant shared objective.
	
	
	The direction complained of by the applicant was as follows (SC15, emphasis added in the applicant’s written submissions):
	


“There is one aspect of the address to you on behalf of the accused that I want to correct in relation to your consideration of this element and that is that the Crown does not have to prove, in order to establish that the accused knew that this was a criminal group, that he knew every single member of that group who the Crown alleges was a member of that criminal group. For that matter the Crown would not necessarily need to prove that he knew any of them at all. Of course you are entitled to take into account evidence about whether or not the accused did or did not know named people in deciding whether or not the Crown has proved in fact that he knew it was a criminal group, but the Crown does not need to prove that he knew each member who they have nominated as being a part of this group. Nor does the Crown need to prove that he knew personally the actual serious indictable offence or offences with which they were involved. It is sufficient if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew his activities amounted to participation in this group of at least three people who were seeking to make material gain from a criminal offence which in fact amounts to a serious indictable offence.

Now this could be seen as a little confusing but in this trial you might think less so because in any event there is no room for ambiguity in your minds about what might or might not have been known because of the way in which the Crown has run the case. In fact, as I have said, for this element to be proved beyond reasonable doubt you would have to be satisfied that the accused knew that what he was doing was participating in either one or all of those three ways that the Crown alleges in a way that amounts to participation with a group of people comprising at least three from amongst those named people and that he knew that that group was involved in trafficking illegal or prohibited drugs or substantial quantities of illegal drugs. That is in reality what the Crown case is here and you would have to be satisfied that he knew that there were at least three people involved in doing that to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to this third element.

To prove this element the Crown relies entirely on what is called a circumstantial case, circumstantial evidence, and in due course I am going to come to give you some directions about circumstantial evidence.”


	
	The offence under s 93T required proof that the applicant participated in a criminal group knowing that it was a criminal group and being reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.
	
	
	The term “criminal group” is defined in s 93S of the Act as follows:
	


(1)    In this Division:

   “Criminal group” means a group of 3 or more people who have as their objective or one of their objectives:

(a)   Obtaining material benefits from conduct that constitutes a serious indictable offence, or

…

(2)   A group of people is capable of being a criminal group for the purposes of this Division whether or not:

(a)   Any of them are subordinates or employees of others, or

(b)   Only some of the people involved in the group are involved in planning, organizing or carrying out any particular activity, or

(c)   Its membership changes from time to time.


	
	The applicant submitted that, on its proper construction, the offence under s 93T requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that “the accused knew the identity of all the persons that he was participating in a criminal group with” and that “the accused knew or was reckless to the fact that his participation contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity of that criminal group” (emphasis added).
	
	
	It was submitted that the Crown could not prove those elements unless it proved the accused knew the identity of each of the other members in the criminal group, “otherwise he could not know that he was participating in a criminal group”.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that an accused person’s knowledge in the participation was in relation to specific and particular criminal activity, “otherwise members of the criminal group could be engaging in criminal activities outside the scope of the knowledge of an accused”.
	
	
	It was further submitted that, in the context of this case, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following matters:
	



	
	that the applicant knew the identities of all of the members of the criminal group for the whole of the period alleged in the indictment;
	
	
	that for the whole of the period alleged in the indictment the applicant knew that his participation contributed to the supply of illegal drugs involving Magyari, Cuzman, Bucataru, Bartos, Suto and Bodo.
	



	
	As that contention was expanded in the written submissions, it appeared also to be contended that the Crown had to prove that each of the other members of the group “knew about” each other and that the criminal conduct of each alleged by the Crown was done on the part of that participant with knowledge of participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	In my view, the submissions overstate the task faced by the Crown. The elements of the offence under s 93T as it stood at the relevant time were:
	



	
	that there was a criminal group (within the meaning of s 93S);
	
	
	that the accused participated in that group;
	
	
	knowing that it was a criminal group; and
	
	
	that he knew or was reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.
	



	
	In order to establish the first element, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a group of three or more people who had the relevant shared objective. The judge directed the jury in those terms (SU12 to 13).
	
	
	The Crown sought to prove that element by proving the existence of a group of seven people who had the shared objective of making money by dealing in heroin and cocaine. The issue raised by ground two is whether it followed that, in order to satisfy the third element of the offence (that the applicant knew it was a criminal group), the Crown had to prove that the applicant knew each of the seven alleged to be a member of that group.
	
	
	There are two possibilities as to the proper approach to establishing the offence. One is that, if the Crown alleges the existence of a group of seven people, the element of knowledge that it is a criminal group requires proof of knowledge of the existence of all seven. The alternative is that it is sufficient to prove the existence of at least three and that the accused knew it was a criminal group of at least three having the relevant shared objective as defined in the section (a further complexity of the section mooted during argument in the appeal is whether, on that analysis, they must be the same three but that issue was not raised by the applicant’s grounds of appeal).
	
	
	So far as the researches of the parties have ascertained, there is no authority that determines this issue. Since the time averred in the indictment, s 93T has been amended so as to require a different mental element: see Crimes Amendment (Consorting and Organised Crime) Act 2012 (No 3).
	
	
	The applicant’s contention is that, having alleged the existence of a group of seven, the Crown had to prove not only that the accused knew that there existed a group of seven but also that the accused knew the identity of each of the seven. Further, it was submitted that the applicant had to know the identities of each of the seven for the whole time period alleged in the indictment (from 1 March 2010 to 2 June 2010). In the absence of any authority considering that issue, the applicant was left to point to what he contended was “a reasonable and proper construction of the section”. In particular, it was submitted that, if an accused person did not know the identity of each other member of the criminal group, he could not know that he was participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	The criminalisation of participation in a group often carries complexities of language in the relevant statute but a sensible construction is usually discernible. A strong indication against the construction of s 93T contended for by the applicant is the last clause of s 93S(2), which provides that a group of people is capable of being a criminal group whether or not its membership changes from time to time. That reflects parliament’s recognition of the improbability of fixed membership in such groups (for one matter, some of their members occasionally get arrested).
	
	
	That is a factor which, in my view, points to the conclusion that the offence does not require proof that the accused knew the identity of each member of the group throughout the whole of the relevant period. To adopt the language of a different field of jurisprudence, criminal liability attaches for participation in a group that is fixed and floating. It would be enough, in my view, for the Crown to prove that the accused knew, at the time of his participation, that he was participating in a group of three or more people who had the relevant shared objective.
	
	
	Further, in my view, it would be possible for the Crown to prove knowledge of the existence of a group even if the accused person did not know the identity of each member of the group; a person can have criminal dealings with another person without knowing his or her identity. As it happens, that issue is of no moment in the present context since, as already noted, the applicant acknowledged knowing five of the seven members of the Crown’s alleged group. The critical issue at the trial was whether he knew (at the time of his participation) that at least three of those people had as their objective obtaining material benefits (making money) from conduct that constitutes a serious offence (dealing in substantial quantities of heroin and cocaine).
	
	
	A further factor pointing to the construction of the section contended for by the Crown is the further element of the definition in s 93S(2) that a group of people is capable of being a criminal group whether or not only some of the people involved in the group are involved in planning, organising or carrying out any particular activity. As submitted by the Crown, that was illustrated in the present case, where the group largely revolved around Magyari. Parliament plainly intended to criminalise participation in a group defined by reference to the shared criminal objective of its members. Knowledge of the identity of each member does not appear to me to be an obvious requirement of such liability; an objective can be revealed with anonymity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that some support for its contended construction of the legislation may be found in the analogy of the law of conspiracy. It is open in that context to prove the existence of an agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act even though the alleged conspirators may never have seen each other and never corresponded or even heard each other’s names, provided there is proof of acts on each part to sustain an inference that they were engaged in accomplishing the same object: Ex parte Coffey; Re Evans & anor [1971] 1 NSWLR 434 at 445. Although the ultimate question is to determine what the words of s 93T mean, that common law context provides some support for the conclusion I have reached.
	
	
	Separately, the applicant submitted that the Crown needed to prove “that the appellant knew that his participation contributed to the supply of illegal drug dealing allegedly involving Magyari, Cuzman, Bucataru, Bartos, Suto and Bodo”. As submitted by the Crown, that is simply not an element of the offence. What is required is proof that when the applicant participated in the criminal group, he knew it was a criminal group and knew or was reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.
	
	
	In my view, ground two is not made out.
	


Ground Three


	
	Ground three is:
	


The trial miscarried in relation to count one due to the fact that the actions of the [applicant] could not be shown to have contributed to the activities of the criminal group and the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the [applicant’s] guilt.


	
	As with ground one, this ground appears to invoke the Court’s power to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	As already noted, the Crown identified three ways in which the applicant was alleged to have participated in a criminal group (the establishment of any one of which would suffice):
	



	
	by his assistance with the installation or operation of security cameras at Magyari’s home at Drummoyne and also at the drug safe house at Bexley;
	
	
	by allowing his bank accounts to be used to receive money from Magyari and then transferring funds to Magyari’s account in Hungary; and
	
	
	by assisting Toemoeskoezy with the withdrawal of $95,000 from her bank account after the execution of the search warrant at their flat and the arrest of Magyari.
	



	
	As to the security cameras, the applicant submitted that his actions were not shown to have contributed to any criminal activity. He submitted that there was no evidence as to which criminal group of three was assisted by the installation of the cameras and no nexus shown between the installation of the cameras and any criminal activity.
	
	
	In my view, it is a misconception of the offence to contend that the Crown must establish that the accused’s participation in fact assists three or more members of the group. The section criminalises participation, not successful assistance. In any event, as submitted by the Crown, the installation of a surveillance system at the Bexley drug safe house and at Magyari’s home was plainly calculated to assist Magyari in the conduct of his drug trade.
	
	
	As to the assistance provided by the applicant in accompanying Toemoeskoezy to withdraw her funds from the bank, the applicant submitted again that his conduct “was not shown to have contributed in any way to alleged criminality by the alleged criminal group” especially given that it was not directly proved that those funds were the proceeds of crime. As submitted by the Crown, it was plainly open to infer that the applicant knew those funds were the proceeds of Magyari’s drug supply syndicate and that the withdrawal of those funds was calculated to enable them to be laundered or else placed beyond the reach of authorities so as to be available for use by Magyari. The evidence was that the applicant accompanied Toemoeskoezy to withdraw a total of $95,000 from six different banks over two days following Magyari’s arrest. It would be naïve to accept an innocent characterisation of that conduct.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions in respect of his conduct in transferring amounts to Magyari’s account have been considered in respect of ground one above.
	
	
	In my view, ground three is not made out.
	


Ground Four


	
	Ground four is:
	


The trial miscarried due to the Crown’s unfairness in addressing the jury at the end of the trial on the critical matter of desiccant not put to the [applicant] in cross-examination.


	
	The Crown said:
	


“Here’s something that came to me late in the piece when I was reviewing evidence after the accused had finished giving his evidence on Friday. You must bear in mind I never had a chance to ask him about this or confront him with it so you will take that into account when you weigh up whether or not it means anything. When you look at exhibit G, which are the telephone conversations between Magyari and the accused, and you have the transcripts of those, look at exhibit G and you turn up p 790 on the bottom right hand side, you will hear the accused, or you will read that the accused said, as translated from Hungarian to English, the word “desiccant”. This is p 790 which you have. Conversation, by the way was on 8 April, remember? Three days after he was photographed, if you believe the date stamp on the photographs, three days after he was photographed inside the safe house. Here he is three days later talking to Magyari and the accused used these words. This is in the middle of p 790. I’ll read you the last couple of paragraphs.

“Roughly it’s the same, like, what happened with the desiccant that it would have arrived a long time ago if not for the uncertainty we are living in. If there is a definite idea, then we know how it fits into it.”

The “it” that he’s referring to is, you will see from the context of the conversation, is a component for the security system that they’re talking about. But the point is this. The accused used the word “desiccant” when he said

“Roughly it’s the same, like, what happened with the desiccant that it would have arrived a long time ago if not for the uncertainty we are living in.”

What about those little blue and white crystals that you saw that are in evidence and you’ve seen photographs of, the desiccant that was part of the drying apparatus, along with the dehumidifier? That was a part of the safe house drug factory, for want of a better word, together with the press, plastic bags and those sorts of things. Remember, this is the same house that, when the accused was interviewed during the search on 31 May, he says, “I don’t know what was going on inside the place”. There was never any mention then about Magyari looking after it for people who were overseas or who were away. He just said, “I don’t remember. I don’t know”. As I put to him in cross-examination, he was trying to distance himself from anything to do with that drug house. That drug safe house. That’s the reason. But if, looking at the circumstance, and this is just one circumstance. Remember, he’s used the word “desiccant” of itself may prove nothing. It might be a desiccant that had some relation to something else. But, what a remarkable coincidence that three days after being filmed in the drug house, he should talk about one of the chemicals that was in common use and which was discovered there the next month on 31 May when police raided it gathered together all of the chemicals and drugs that were found in the drug house. And included in that haul, were desiccants.”


	
	As conceded by the Crown at the outset of those remarks, the issue of the alleged reference to “desiccant” in a recorded telephone conversation with Magyari had not been put to the applicant in cross-examination.
	
	
	The judge reiterated that concession in her summing up, saying to the jury:
	


[The applicant] has never been given the chance to explain what he meant when he used that word. The Crown himself conceded that he had only thought about this over the weekend. There is a basic rule of fairness in trials which is that people should be given a chance to respond to allegations made against them and where that has not occurred, like in relation to this particular issue, you may well think that you would not be entitled to give that argument much weight. It would be a matter for you, but it is a piece of evidence which the accused has not been given the opportunity to respond to.


	
	The applicant submits that, notwithstanding those remarks, the unfairness could not be overcome. He submitted that the breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn [1989] VR 845 was highly significant in the context that the Crown had cross-examined the applicant as to his knowledge of the Bexley address and whether he had seen desiccant there. The applicant denied that he was aware of the desiccant. It was submitted that, in that circumstance, the effect of the Crown’s address was to place the applicant in a position where it appeared he had lied on that issue.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no unfairness. The evidence included 31 intercepted telephone conversations between the applicant and Magyari in which they spoke Hungarian. They had been translated into English by a NAATI-accredited interpreter. The translation was admitted into evidence and that is recorded as having occurred without objection (exhibit G; T207). The accuracy of the translations was not disputed (their accuracy was confirmed by Sergeant Kisa (T189.13), as to whom see ground six below). Copies of the English translations were given to the jury and read to the jury by the Crown prosecutor, also without objection (T208-215).
	
	
	As a result of the admission of exhibit G, the applicant was plainly on notice that there was evidence before the jury that he had used the Hungarian word for desiccant in a telephone conversation with Magyari. Further, he had been cross-examined as to his knowledge that there was desiccant in the Bexley drug safe house (which he had denied) (T469). If the applicant was made to appear a liar, that was not so much due to the Crown’s submission but the combination of that evidence in the trial. In the circumstances, it is doubtful whether there was any unfairness in the fact that the Crown did not confront the applicant with his use of that term. It was open to the applicant to address that matter himself, in chief.
	
	
	In any event, in my view, any hint of unfairness was amply addressed by the careful remarks of the trial judge. Ground four is not established.
	


Ground six


	
	It is convenient to deal with ground six next. That ground is:
	


The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Sergeant John Kisa pertaining to statements allegedly made by the [applicant] to Ms Toemoeskoezy during the search at Ms Toemoeskoezy’s home at Barnstaple Road.


	
	Police executed a search warrant at Toemoeskoezy’s flat on 31 May 2010. The applicant had been staying there and was present during the execution of the warrant. One of the police who assisted as a searching officer during the execution of the warrant was Sergeant Kisa. He speaks fluent Hungarian. He is not NAATI-accredited but was raised by his Hungarian grandmother and so spoke exclusively Hungarian as a child. He has continued to speak Hungarian throughout his life (T171). Since five of the seven members of the alleged criminal group were Hungarian, it is hardly surprising that a Hungarian-speaking officer would be involved in the investigation, if one was available. In addition to his role as a searching officer, Sergeant Kisa was recruited to assist with the execution of the warrant to translate any documents located that were written in Hungarian.
	
	
	At the outset of the search, the applicant and Toemoeskoezy spoke in Hungarian to each other. They were requested by the officer in charge (Sergeant Schreuder) to speak in English.
	
	
	For most of the period of the execution of the warrant, Sergeant Kisa was not in the immediate presence of the applicant and was not able to hear any conversation between the applicant and Toemoeskoezy. He did, however, overhear a number of remarks made by the applicant to Toemoeskoezy in Hungarian. When the applicant was asked about a notebook with Hungarian writing in it which had a reference to “Access Security Systems” (exhibit D), Sergeant Kisa heard the applicant say (in Hungarian), “they are trying to make links, this is getting interesting” (T174.10).
	
	
	Sergeant Kisa subsequently heard the applicant say (in Hungarian), “they are not going to find the thing I told you about earlier” (T175.39) and, later, “they can’t link us to anything” (T176).
	
	
	When police located a document containing Hungarian writing, the applicant said to Toemoeskoezy in Hungarian, “I told you to throw that away before” (T177.26). According to the evidence of Sergeant Schreuder, that was a heated exchange. In the bottom corner of one page was written a Queensland address which relates to ground five, considered below. The document was tendered in the trial (exhibit E).
	
	
	At the trial, the applicant objected to the admission of Sergeant Kisa’s evidence as to the remarks made by the applicant to Toemoeskoezy in Hungarian during the execution of the search warrant. The basis for the objection was that the evidence should have been excluded in exercise of the Court’s discretion under s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That section provides:
	


In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:

(a)   The evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and

(b)    Having regard to the circumstance in which the admission was made,

it would be unfair to an accused to use the evidence.


	
	An aspect of the alleged unfairness was the contention that Sergeant Kisa was deliberately placed in the role of an eavesdropper. The applicant submitted that Sergeant Kisa’s attendance would hardly be a coincidence. As already noted, it may be accepted that his participation in the investigation was not a coincidence. He conceded as much (T193.43). A Hungarian-speaking officer would be an obvious boon in the investigation of a Hungarian-speaking drug syndicate. Sergeant Kisa had been involved from an early stage of the investigation. He had listened to 3,548 intercepted telephone conversations (T187.34), most of which were in Hungarian (T194.1).
	
	
	It does not follow that his role at the execution of the search warrant was to eavesdrop. The trial judge expressly rejected that contention, accepting the evidence of both Sergeant Kisa and Sergeant Schreuder on that issue. In particular, her Honour had regard to Sergeant Kisa’s evidence that, for most of the time during which the warrant was executed (stated to be about 95%), he was engaged in the role of a searcher and was unable to hear anything the applicant may have said. The judge also noted that the applicant’s remarks in Hungarian to Toemoeskoezy were made after Sergeant Schreuder had expressly asked him to speak in English.
	
	
	The applicant seeks to challenge the finding that Sergeant Kisa was not brought to the premises as an eavesdropper on the basis of the following evidence given by Sergeant Schreuder during the trial (T143-144):
	


Q.   The search was being recorded that day. Isn’t that correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.    There was nothing to stop you was there when Senior Constable Kisa came to you the first time and said these two occupants had said something, there was nothing to stop you from asking Kisa to ask the two occupants to repeat what was said?

A.   That’s correct. Yes.

Q.   Then there would have been a record that we could have all heard and seen?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You decided not to do that?

A.   No.

Q.   And that’s because you wanted to keep the use of him [Kisa] as being able to eavesdrop on what was being said?

A.   Yes.


	
	The proposition appears to be that that evidence impugns the judge’s earlier finding (based on the evidence on the voir dire) that Sergeant Kisa was not in the role of an eavesdropper. I do not think there is any force in that contention. Sergeant Schreuder’s agreement that he wanted to be able to keep using Sergeant Kisa to eavesdrop at that point does not amount to a concession that that is the purpose for which Sergeant Kisa was brought to the premises. As already noted, the fact that Sergeant Kisa spent almost all of his time out of the hearing of the applicant cogently contradicts that proposition. To the extent that this ground challenges her Honour’s conclusion on that issue, it is without substance and must be rejected.
	
	
	Separately, the applicant contends that the use of the admissions was unfair to the applicant because he was not given an opportunity to adopt (or contest) Sergeant Kisa’s notes of the remarks. The trial judge found, after a hearing on the voir dire, that there was no unfairness on that account. Her Honour referred to the history of the use of “verbals” in this State and the need for the Court to be alive to the need to exclude verbal admissions where appropriate guidelines have not been adhered to. She noted, however, that the applicant was not a detained person at the time. He was a visitor at the premises where the search warrant was being executed and was not the occupier of the premises. He was not obliged to speak to, or in the presence of, police and was cautioned twice during the execution of the warrant, which was video recorded. He was requested to speak in English, not in Hungarian. He chose to speak to police, for the most part, in English but to Toemoeskoezy in Hungarian.
	
	
	The judge further observed that it had not been put to Sergeant Kisa on the voir dire that the admissions he recorded were never said or were not said as alleged. The alleged unfairness in not giving the applicant an opportunity to adopt the admissions had to be assessed in that context. The content of the remarks reported by Sergeant Kisa do not suggest confabulation on his part.
	
	
	I would respectfully agree with the trial judge’s ruling. Once the applicant started making incriminating remarks to Toemoeskoezy in Hungarian (contrary to Sergeant Schreuder’s request that he speak in English), I do not think the requirements of fairness mandated that he be interrupted and asked to adopt a note of what he had just said. The use of an unguarded incriminating remark heard by police is not inherently unfair.
	
	
	Separately, the applicant contends that the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, since the remarks were equivocal and were open to innocent explanation. That is a perhaps charitable interpretation of the remarks but, in any event, it reflects the application of the wrong test. Section 137 requires the Court to exclude evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.
	
	
	In determining whether the section applies, the Court should consider the inference most favourable to the Crown and assess the potential probative value of the evidence on that basis, without regard to the availability of any competing inference. There is ample authority for that proposition; the Crown cited R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335 per Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (with whom R A Hulme J and Barr AJ agreed).
	
	
	Further, it is doubtful whether the evidence was prejudicial in the sense comprehended in s 137. Evidence is not prejudicial because it tends to prove an accused’s guilt. In my view, the evidence was properly admitted. Ground 6 is not made out.
	


Ground Five


	
	Ground five is:
	


The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Detective Andrews in respect of seizures from a search warrant at the Queensland address of Mr Bartos.


	
	Mr Bartos was one of the seven members of the alleged criminal group. He lived in Queensland. His address in Queensland was the address recorded on the piece of paper found at Toemoeskoezy’s flat (referred to above). Detective Andrews was a Queensland detective who executed a search warrant at those premises on 2 June 2010. The items found by police at those premises relevantly included a small amount of cocaine, plastic bags containing suspected cocaine and heroin and six mobile telephones (T316 to 316). The proposition that Bartos was a member of the criminal group came, in part, from the fact that his address was written on a piece of paper seized at Toemoeskoezy’s flat. It was when the two pieces of paper on which that address was written were found that Sergeant Kisa overheard the applicant say to Toemoeskoezy, “I told you to throw that away before” (T177).
	
	
	That document contained a large amount of information including figures and calculations. The other page had further scribbles together with drawings described in evidence at T177 as “farmyard animals” including a crocodile, an elephant, a hippopotamus and a giraffe. The applicant’s remark about having instructed Toemoeskoezy to throw the document away did not refer unequivocally to the Queensland address.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he had met Bartos, who was also Hungarian and in Magyari’s group of friends, “a few times” (T454). He described him as an acquaintance rather than a friend (T453 to T454).
	
	
	The applicant gave an explanation for having Bartos’ address written on the piece of paper by saying that, shortly after Bartos moved to Queensland, Toemoeskoezy had wanted to visit him so he (the applicant) rang him to get his address (T454.46).
	
	
	In cross-examination, the Crown suggested to the applicant that, during the execution of the search warrant at his flat, proved his knowledge that Bartos was involved with drugs by being nervous when police found the page with Bartos’ address on it. He also suggested that the accused became upset with Toemoeskoezky for not having thrown that piece of paper out as he had instructed because he knew the address would link him to another part of Magyari’s criminal group (T470).
	
	
	The applicant’s response was that he did not remember the conversation and that there was no more relation with Bartos than what he had said. The applicant’s evidence was given through an interpreter. It is very difficult to form any view, from the transcript, as to its likely impact on the jury.
	
	
	The applicant submits that there was no evidence in the trial that the drugs seized at Bartos’ address had come from the criminal group and no evidence that the applicant had any knowledge of the drugs located at Bartos’ address. I do not accept that submission. The connection came from the applicant’s unguarded remarks in Hungarian to Toemoeskoezy during the execution of the search warrant, overheard by a police officer who speaks Hungarian. Whether that evidence was tenuous was very much a matter for the jury’s assessment. In my view, the evidence was admissible. Ground five is not made out.
	


Ground seven


	
	Ground seven is:
	


The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Detective Hamilton.


	
	Two of the members of the alleged criminal group were Cuzman and Bucataru, who lived in Adelaide. Police had covertly recorded telephone conversations between them and Magyari. Cuzman and Bucataru were not Hungarian and the conversations were in English. A collection of the calls were identified as “telephone intercepted calls No 3”. Those recordings, together with transcripts of them, were provided to Detective Hamilton for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to the language used, based on his experience in the illicit drug trade.
	
	
	After a hearing on the voir dire, the judge ruled the evidence to be admissible. Ground seven challenges the correctness of that ruling. In her judgment on that issue, the judge described the detective as an ad hoc expert. With great respect to her Honour, I would not use that expression to describe the expertise of Detective Hamilton. The expression “ad hoc expert” has been used to describe a witness who gives an opinion based on expertise acquired for the very purpose of the proceedings in which the evidence is to be given, such as so-called voice identification experts. The care with which the admission of such evidence must be approached is considered in the judgment of this Court in Nasrallah v R [2015] NSWCCA 188 (at the time of publishing this judgment, that judgment remained restricted but is available on the JIRS website).
	
	
	Detective Hamilton’s expertise was not of that kind. He had extensive (lawful) experience in the illicit drug trade. His evidence in the trial as to his experience was as follows:
	


Experience investigating drug offences. During 2002 and 2003, I performed investigation duties at the Kings Cross Drug Unit. These duties involved the investigation of street to middle-level drug supplies involved in the distribution of prohibited drugs in the Kings Cross area. I have been the officer-in-charge of many controlled operations involving the purchase of prohibited drugs. I have managed numerous criminal informants and have detailed discussions with these informants regarding the drug supply community and the methodologies used by drug suppliers to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities.

Experience as an undercover operative. Between 2001 and 2002, I assisted in numerous prohibited drug-related investigations as a street level operative. My role in these investigations involved the controlled purchase of the prohibited drugs, including heroin, methylamphetamine, cocaine, MDA [MDMA?], which has the street name ecstasy, and cannabis. These operations involve the investigation of drug distribution from visible street dealers. A street dealer is a person who supplies drugs to another person for personal use.

Between 2003 and 2004, I assisted in further prohibited drug-related investigations as an undercover operative. During this time I worked undercover with and without informants and was involved in the direct negotiation and purchase from persons of street to medium level. During this time I worked undercover with and without informants and was involved in the direct negotiation and purchase from persons of street to medium level amounts of methylamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. These operations involved the investigation of drug distribution from middle level dealers. Middle level dealers supply quantities of drugs to persons for further distribution and may be for and on behalf of persons who have imported or manufactured the prohibited drugs.

Between 2004 and 2007, I was attached to the Special Services Group undercover branch as a full time undercover operative. I was involved in numerous investigations into the medium to high level supply of illicit drugs. My duties at this time involved me negotiating and purchasing amounts of illicit drugs from persons directly involved in the manufacture and/or distribution process, as well as conducting a variety a of other undercover duties. I communicated extensively with established and professional criminals in person and via telephone using the jargon, techniques and the methodologies expected of an experienced drug supplier.

During this time I played a major role in investigations, operations and training in a multi-agency and cross-jurisdictional working environment. I have worked on operations with agencies such as the major crime squads, Victorian Police and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have been involved in numerous controlled operations and directly negotiated with persons for sale and purchase of up to large commercial amounts of illicit drugs, including heroin, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and designer drugs. I am experienced training undercover operatives and supervisors.

Since 2004, I have been involved in the design, planning and conduct of the New South Wales Police undercover operative training program. I have been involved in the selection, training and assessment of the New South Wales Police Force street level operatives, undercover operatives and undercover supervisors prior to operational undercover deployment. I restructured a number of components of the undercover program and have since that date trained and advised undercover operatives and supervisors on these subjects. I relied on my personal experience in directly dealing with persons involved with the administration and supply of illicit drugs from street level to manufacturing and importation in order to design this training. I also relied on my dealing with informants and continued experience and research on these topics.

I have trained numerous undercover operatives and supervisors from New South Wales Police Force on the topic of prohibited drugs and the techniques and methodologies used by suppliers of prohibited drugs. Subjects covered include the manufacture, packaging, cutting, purity, prices, profit, distribution, terminology, administration and affects (sic) of the most commonly available illicit drugs such as cannabis, amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and designer drugs.

In 2006 I attended the FBI undercover training school in the USA where I was an international observer of the special agent undercover training course. During this course I liaised extensively with undercover operatives, supervisors, and staff from agencies such as the FBI, the New York Police Department, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, as well as from the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States. I am an accredited supervisor of undercover operations targeting cannabis, methylamphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy.

Between January 2007 and August 2010 I performed duties as investigator in the New South Wales Police State Crime Command, Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad. My duties included investigation of drug [production], importation, distribution and supply as well as a variety of other criminal offences.


	
	Detective Hamilton’s evidence was that, based on his experience, the majority of drug dealers have a belief to varying degrees that law enforcement agencies activity monitor and record telephone conversations in an attempt to detect criminal behaviour (he added that that is in fact the truth). He said that such persons conduct telephone conversations regarding drug transactions using slang, pre-determined codes or veiled speech in order to disguise the true purpose of their conversations. He defined veiled speech as conversations where the true purpose is disguised but in a less elaborate and more flexible way than with the use of a code, for example “I want to get the same as before” or “wait at the usual place”. For slang, he gave the example of the use of the term “paper” to mean money. He defined codes as being specific to particular drug dealers or groups of dealers.
	
	
	From exhibit J, he identified what he would loosely describe as a code specific to Magyari, being the discussion of medical treatment when enquiring about the quality and availability of a quantity of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Detective Hamilton did not purport to translate the language of exhibit J by reference to any particular language he learned from his experience in the illicit drug trade. Much of the applicant’s argument under this ground misconceives the nature of his evidence in that respect. Rather, he explained why he regarded each of the examples as being consistent with his experience of the choice of codes by particular drug dealers. For example, he pointed out that one of the difficulties with the use of codes is when the predetermined code fits awkwardly into a conversation. By way of example unrelated to this case, he gave the example of the term “white lady” as code for an ounce of heroin. With that code, a buyer could ask to meet the white lady tomorrow and enquire what time she would be at the café. The difficulty would arise if the buyer wished to purchase half an ounce of heroin. Detective Hamilton gave an examples of two conversations between Cuzman and Magyari in which the “doctor” code fitted awkwardly into the relevant exchange (the conversations are at AB 256-257 and 263).
	
	
	The Crown case was that Cuzman and Bucataru were large scale purchasers of Magyari’s drugs. It was made clear that the Crown did not assert that the applicant had anything to do with them. The evidence was relied upon to establish the first element of count one; that is, the existence of a criminal group headed by Magyari.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions on this ground entailed an element of confusion. In terms, the ground alleges error in admitting the evidence of Detective Hamilton. However, the argument put in support of the ground appeared to be directed also to the admission of the transcripts of the telephone calls themselves.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence pertaining to alleged drug codes used in telephone calls between Magyari, Cuzman and Bucataru should not have been admitted into evidence for two reasons:
	


“(1)   Detective Hamilton’s evidence was irrelevant, and or even if relevant, created a grave unfairness to the [applicant] receiving a fair trial as it dealt with admissions by third parties and not the [applicant]”;

(2)   Detective Hamilton’s evidence was opinion and he was not qualified to give such evidence given that his opinions were not contemporary and no clear foundation was lead (sic) for his evidence”.


	
	As to the first point, the evidence was plainly relevant to the issue whether there existed a criminal group. As to its admissibility, the reference to the fact that the evidence related to admissions by third parties was intended to sustain a submission that the evidence infringed the rule against hearsay.
	
	
	As noted by the Crown, the response to that contention is that the calls were admitted for the limited purpose of proving steps taken by three of the members of the alleged group to establish the existence and nature of the criminal group. The trial judge directed the jury on that basis and there is no complaint as to her Honour’s directions.
	
	
	As to the objection based on the fact that the evidence was opinion, the specific complaint (at written submissions, paragraphs 87 to 92) was that the witness impermissibly strayed into asserting his opinion as fact. The authorities relied upon by the applicant in support of this ground acknowledge that opinion evidence is not inadmissible only because it is about a fact in issue or an ultimate issue. The burden of the submission was that, in the context of a criminal trial, caution must be exercised when considering expressions of opinion close to the ultimate issue: Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204 at [28], per Studdart J (Hall and Latham JJ agreeing).
	
	
	The applicant identified only two short extracts from Detective Hamilton’s evidence said to trespass impermissibly into the territory of factual assertion, as follows:
	


“During this conversation Cuzman asks, “So you went to the doctors, you don’t feel better at all, no?” and the immediate answer provided by Magyari is “I’ve got some more of the old stock”. This supports my opinion that the inquiry is about doctors and treatment are a code related to prohibited drugs. Further, similar examples occur within other conversations below… The conversation alluded to one of the common difficulties encountered by persons involved in the illicit drug trade surrounding maintaining a consistent quality and quantity of drugs.”

“This exchange is typical of two persons negotiating the supply of prohibited drugs where a pre-determined code is in the medical treatment.”


	
	On a fair reading of Detective Hamilton’s evidence as a whole, I do not think the applicant’s complaint on that account is made good.
	
	
	Separately, the applicant submitted that no proper foundation for expert evidence of the kind given by Detective Hamilton was established. He submitted that the detective did not demonstrate any real expertise in the field of codes and veiled language and that the task undertaken by him could readily be undertaken by a layman listening to and reading transcript of the 56 pages of telephone conversations.
	
	
	There is force in the contention that the issue whether a particular conversation includes the use of veiled or coded speech or slang is one which, depending upon the circumstances of the individual case, may well be able to be undertaken by the jury. If Detective Hamilton’s opinion on that issue was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation, his opinion could not rationally affect the jury’s assessment of the relevant fact and would accordingly be irrelevant: cf Smith v R [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at [11].
	
	
	The content of the telephone calls was available to the jury. The transcript had already been tendered during the evidence of Detective Amey (exhibit J) and the recordings were played to the jury at that point (T220).
	
	
	However, Detective Hamilton’s evidence was not confined to an analysis of exhibit J that could have been undertaken by the jury. It was, for the main part, drawn from his extensive experience as an undercover police operative dealing directly with drug dealers and his involvement in many controlled operations involving the purchase of drugs. He had, over many years, directly observed the techniques and methodologies used by suppliers of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	I accept that this is an area in which caution is required in determining whether, in the circumstances of an individual case, opinion evidence as to the use of codes is properly admissible against an accused person. The use of police as ad hoc experts must be approached with particular caution. In the present case, the trial judge found (correctly, in my respectful opinion) that much of the opinion expressed by Detective Hamilton was in respect of the use of veiled or coded speech generally rather than the use of a particular word as code for a drug-related word.
	
	
	In my view, ground seven is not made out.
	


Ground eight


	
	Ground eight is:
	


The trial judge erred in not giving a warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act as to the potential unreliability of the evidence of Detective Hamilton.


	
	The matters relied upon by the applicant to support the contention that the evidence was unreliable were expressed as follows:
	



	
	being his subjective opinions, his evidence cannot be examined by an independent expert;
	
	
	his evidence was largely subjective and not based on any measurable criteria;
	
	
	his alleged expertise was dated and the alleged coded and or veiled language used in the intercepted telephone calls could have referred to other matters apart from illegal drugs;
	
	
	the evidence in the telephone conversations was “hearsay” evidence in that none of the speakers was called at the appellant’s trial and could not be tested under cross-examination; and
	
	
	in all the circumstances of the case the general direction to the jury by the trial judge as to expert evidence was insufficient.
	



	
	In my view, this ground is misconceived. The evidence did not fall within one of the listed categories in s 165(1) of the Evidence Act. As submitted on behalf of the applicant, that is an inclusive provision and it is not necessary for evidence to fall within one of those categories before the section can have operation. However, I do not think any of the matters identified on behalf of the applicant is such as to bring Detective Hamilton’s evidence within the scope of the section.
	
	
	The reference to the alleged inadequacy of the summing-up finds no logical place under the heading of this ground. In any event, I have read the entire summing up. I would reject the contention that it was inadequate in this (or any other) respect.
	


Ground nine


	
	Ground nine is:
	


The verdicts were unreasonable or could not be supported by evidence.


	
	This is a ground which requires leave, since it raises questions of fact. In my view, leave to appeal on this ground should be refused.
	
	
	The Crown provided detailed written submission in respect of this ground. The applicant did not. The only submissions put in writing were as follows:
	


“It is submitted that there was a clear inference consistent with innocence on the defence case in relation to both counts and that accordingly any inferences in the Crown case had been displaced.

It is submitted that upon the state of the evidence at the end of the case that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that in such circumstances the jury ought to have acquitted the applicant.”


	
	Where a ground that a verdict was unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence is added almost as an afterthought or at least as no more than a catch-all safety net appended to a series of specific grounds without the assistance of any discrete reasoned argument to support it, in my view leave should be refused.
	
	
	That is the approach that has been adopted by this Court in a number of cases: see Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [50] to [51] per Leeming JA; Johnson J and R S Hulme AJ agreeing at [112] and [113] respectively; Clarke v R [2014] NSWCCA 236 at [65] per Leeming JA; Price and McCallum JJ agreeing at [93] and [94] respectively; El Haddad v R [2015] NSWCCA 10 at [121] to [127] per Leeming JA; McCallum and R A Hulme JJ agreeing at [129] and [130] respectively.
	
	
	For those reasons, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	To the extent that leave to appeal is required, leave be granted except in respect of ground 9;
	
	
	That the appeal be dismissed.

2702990,Application of Malcolm Potier [2015] NSWCCA 199,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: This judgment principally concerns the question of whether the Court should issue a warrant to stay the deportation of Malcolm Potier pursuant to s 151 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
	


Background


	
	Mr Potier is a citizen of the United Kingdom. From around 1989 he was in a de facto relationship with a fellow UK citizen, a Ms Oswald. The couple had a daughter. The relationship between Mr Potier and Ms Oswald broke down in August 1999. Family law proceedings were commenced in England.
	
	
	In December 1999 Mr Potier flew to Australia with the couple’s daughter using false passports. In February 2000, following information provided to the Federal Police by an acquaintance he had made after his arrival in this country, Mr Potier was detained and held in custody. Ms Oswald, who came to Australia in early 2000 to search for her daughter, had by then begun a relationship with a Mr Wakeham.
	
	
	In 2000 Mr Potier was charged with two counts that between 2 and 8 May 2000 he solicited a person to murder Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham. At that time Mr Potier was in detention in Villawood.
	
	
	Mr Potier was found guilty by jury verdict on 16 October 2001 and was convicted of those two counts of soliciting to murder. Mr Potier filed a Notice of Appeal against the conviction.
	
	
	On 10 May 2002 Mr Potier was sentenced on each of the counts to imprisonment for six years and eight months with a non-parole period of five years expiring on 7 May 2005. The Crown filed a Notice of Appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence. Mr Potier appealed against the sentence.
	
	
	The two sentence appeals were heard together. On 25 August 2004 this Court refused Mr Potier leave to appeal against sentence and allowed the Crown appeal: R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136. The Court resentenced Mr Potier to a total term of imprisonment of eight years and eight months with a total non-parole period of six years and three months to expire on 7 August 2006.
	
	
	Mr Potier subsequently filed a special leave application to the High Court but later abandoned the application.
	
	
	On 17 February 2006 this Court dismissed Mr Potier’s appeal against conviction: Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27. Mr Potier filed a special leave application to the High Court in relation to the convictions. This application was dismissed: Potier v The Queen [2013] HCATrans 207.
	
	
	In the meantime, Mr Potier had been charged that between 1 January 2002 and 8 February 2002 he solicited a person to murder Ms Oswald. On 3 October 2006 the jury returned a guilty verdict. On 13 November 2006 Shadbolt DCJ sentenced Mr Potier to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of seven years expiring on 6 August 2013.
	
	
	He appealed to this Court against his conviction. For reasons unexplained the Appeal was not heard until 10 November 2014.
	
	
	In 2013 the State Parole Authority determined that Mr Potier was not suitable for parole. Mr Potier sought a review of that determination. On 19 July 2013 that application for review was dismissed. As a consequence the question of parole was not able to be further determined for at least 12 months.
	
	
	The State Parole Authority scheduled a further hearing for 13 August 2014 to determine whether Mr Potier ought to be granted parole.
	
	
	In 2012 the Attorney-General commenced proceedings against Mr Potier under the Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW) to have him declared a vexatious litigant. On 25 February 2014 McCallum J made orders preventing Mr Potier from instituting any further proceedings and stayed any pending proceedings instituted by him, excepting in both cases anything to do with his proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal: Attorney-General (NSW) v Potier [2014] NSWSC 118.
	
	
	Mr Potier appealed against the orders of McCallum J to the Court of Appeal. That appeal was heard on 25 March 2015. Judgment was reserved.
	
	
	Garling J had been appointed to case manage the appeal by Mr Potier against his conviction at the trial before Shadbolt DCJ. Mr Potier wrote to Garling J on 19 June 2014. In effect, that letter was asking Garling J to grant a criminal justice stay warrant as provided for in s 151 of the Migration Act. Garling fixed a hearing of the application for 31 July 2014.
	
	
	The purpose of the application was made clear both in the letter of 19 June 2014 and in oral submissions by Mr Potier on 31 July 2014. The visa that Mr Potier had as an unlawful non-citizen was a visa that entitled him to be in Australia in custody. If he were to be released to parole that visa would be cancelled and he would be liable to deportation. If he were deported he would be disadvantaged as far as pursuing his appeal to this Court was concerned.
	
	
	Garling J reserved his decision on 31 July. At its meeting on 13 August 2014 the State Parole Authority adjourned its consideration of Mr Potier’s parole to 20 November 2014 seemingly at Mr Potier’s request because Garling J had not then delivered judgment.
	
	
	In a judgment of 15 August 2014 Garling J dismissed the application for the issue of the criminal justice stay warrant: Potier v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 157. Garling J’s conclusion was as follows:
	


[37]   However, it is sufficient for the purpose of finally determining this application that I am satisfied that the applicant, Mr Potier, does not have the standing to seek the warrant. The purpose of Div 4 of Pt 2 of the Act is fulfilled when an application is made to the Court for a stay warrant by a person appropriately representing the public interest in the administration of justice. No such application has been made.


	
	This Court, differently constituted, heard Mr Potier’s appeal against conviction on 10 November 2014. It reserved its decision. On 20 November 2014 the State Parole Authority adjourned its consideration of Mr Potier’s parole to 29 January 2015, presumably because this Court had reserved its decision on his appeal.
	
	
	Following the decision of Garling J Mr Potier appealed against that decision to this Court.
	
	
	Subsequently, on 19 February 2015 he forwarded to the Registrar of this Court documents which he said were documents for the laying of an information to this Court relating to the need to have the Court grant a criminal justice stay warrant under s 151 of the Migration Act. For the purpose of that application or the laying of that information Mr Potier accepted Garling J’s determination that he, Mr Potier, had no standing to apply for such a warrant.
	
	
	What was contained in those documents was a recitation of the history of the matter with a statement that the Court had the authority of its own motion and not as a result of any application that he made to grant such a warrant under s 151. Both that application and the appeal against Garling J’s decision were initially fixed for hearing on 20 April 2015. They were relisted on 13 May 2015. That date was subsequently vacated and they were listed on 17 June 2015. Those applications, amongst others, came before the Bench as presently constituted on that day.
	
	
	On 5 March 2015 Mr Potier wrote to the Parole Board saying this:
	


I refer to the parole matter before you to be considered on 12th March 2015. I write to advise you that I have a number of ongoing matters before the Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal where I represent myself, these matters are some way from being resolved and in the circumstances I suggest that any deliberation of the issues before you be deferred until the latter part of April 2015.


	
	On 12 March 2015 the Parole Authority adjourned the application to 14 May 2015 at Mr Potier’s request because judgment had not been delivered by this Court in his conviction appeal and because the appeal to the Court of Appeal in the vexatious litigant proceedings had not been heard.
	
	
	On 8 April 2015 Mr Potier wrote to the Registrar of this Court noting that the documents on the court file had been somewhat superseded by recent matters. He said he took the opportunity of updating the issues for this Court to consider. He attached further submissions and a supporting affidavit.
	
	
	In the submissions he pointed out that although two main hearings had taken place, being the hearing of the appeal against the decision of McCallum J declaring him to be a vexatious litigant and the hearing of the appeal against his conviction before Judge Shadbolt, he said there were some outstanding issues. One was that if the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered a retrial he would need to be in Australia for that purpose. If the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction based on the unreliability of Crown evidence which included recordings used from the first trial as tendency and coincidence evidence, that would directly affect the conviction in relation to the earlier matters.
	
	
	Further, he had made application under what he said was Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) although at the time that application was made it was under s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	On 13 May 2015 Mr Brezniak of counsel made an urgent application to the Registrar for a criminal justice stay warrant because the State Parole Authority was due to consider Mr Potier’s parole the following day. A hearing took place on the afternoon of 13 May but Leeming JA, presiding in this Court, made it clear that no substantive orders could be made on that day. His Honour advised Mr Potier that the Court of Appeal would be handing down its judgment on the appeal from McCallum J that afternoon. Judgment was duly delivered that day: Potier v Attorney-General in and for the State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 129.
	
	
	It seems that Mr Brezniak approached the State Parole Board to request on behalf of Mr Potier that they defer consideration of his parole. The State Parole Authority acceded to that request and adjourned its consideration to 14 August 2015.
	
	
	On 3 June 2015 this Court delivered judgment on Mr Potier’s conviction appeal. The appeal was dismissed: Potier v R [2015] NSWCCA 130.
	
	
	On 4 June 2015 the Registrar wrote to Mr Potier pointing out that since his appeal was dismissed he had no matters pending in the Court with the result that the Court had no jurisdiction to consider issuing a criminal justice stay visa, nor to determine the purported appeal against the decision of Garling J.
	
	
	On 9 June 2015 Mr Potier wrote to the Registrar enclosing an application which he requested should be before this Court when it dealt with the criminal justice stay warrant on 17 June 2015. The application asked this Court to carry out a judicial review of the decision by the Parole Board not to consider his parole prior to August 2015. In the alternative, he sought bail but on the basis that he would be in the custody of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
	
	
	His submissions identified two matters to justify the orders he sought. The first was his application under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) which he said went to the heart of his earlier convictions. The second matter related to proceedings in the Court of Appeal of the United Kingdom where he said he was required to participate in by audio visual link in July 2015. It seems that the Department of Corrective Services had made it clear that an audio visual link could not be organised to enable him to participate in those English proceedings.
	
	
	On 11 June 2015 the Registrar wrote to Mr Potier pointing out that the Court of Criminal Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear a review of a decision by the Parole Board not to bring forward the date of his parole hearing. He was informed that the Notice of Motion he forwarded under cover of his letter of 9 June 2015 had not been filed and would not be dealt with on 17 June 2015.
	
	
	In relation to his Pt 7 application the Registrar said that, as Mr Potier was aware, his application for an enquiry into his earlier convictions was dismissed when he was declared a vexatious litigant. The application was not automatically reinstated as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal. It remained dismissed. He was free, however, to re-lodge an application. In any event, Pt 7 applications are administrative in nature and are dealt with in the first instance by the Supreme Court, not by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	On 12 June 2015 Mr Potier wrote to the Registrar. In that letter he asserted that the application for bail was properly before the Court of Criminal Appeal because of the appeal to that Court.
	
	
	In an affidavit attached to the letter he said also that he had by that time read the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. He said that he had identified a number of important errors of fact and law in its decision and he was making application under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules in that regard.
	
	
	In that affidavit he said this:
	


7.   In addition to the above and of considerable concern which gives rise to the urgency of the matter being decided now is the fact that the Parole Board has resolved to hear the matter before then [any determination of the s 50C application] in August 2015. This is two years after my earliest release date and there is no identifiable reason for its delay.


	
	In fact, it was Mr Potier who sought the delay on each occasion as the material in [18], [19], [25], [26] and [31] above makes clear. His concern has been since his parole date fell due in August 2013 that if he was released to parole he would be immediately deported.
	
	
	In his application pursuant to r 50C he asked that the decision be reopened and that the Court consider the following issues of fact and law:
	


(a)   Mistake of fact as to the authenticity and Importance of the recordings    from the 2000 and 2002 police investigations.

(b)   Mistake of fact and law over the admissibility and consequences of the    Telstra material.

(c)   Mistake of fact and law over the grounds of appeal made out alleging    Judicial bias by the trial judge.

(d)   Mistake of law over the admissibility of conviction to the jury by the    trial judge.

(e)   Mistake of law over what was decided by the High Court of Australia in

   Potier v The Queen (11th February 2013} and the application of the    reasoning of that decision to the Telstra material used in the trial of the    appellant and the consequences to and for this appeal.

(f)   Certain other mistakes of fact and law.


	
	Accordingly, at the time of the hearing of the matters associated with the criminal justice stay warrant the Court had also to consider:
	


(1)   Mr Potier’s application to review the Parole Board’s decision;

(2)   Mr Potier’s application for bail;

In addition, the basis for dealing with the criminal justice stay warrant was different from what had earlier been put forward. The previous basis was that the decision on Mr Potier’s conviction appeal had not been determined. What was now put forward was the existence of the Pt 7 application (if that was still on foot) and his new application under r 50C.

(1)   Review of the Parole Board’s decision


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the State Parole Authority. The Court which has jurisdiction over that authority is the Supreme Court of NSW. If it is sought to review the Authority’s processes and decisions an application must be made to that Court under Pt 59 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). For the limitations on this see Boatswain v State Parole Authority [2014] NSWSC 501.
	
	
	This application fails.
	


(2)   Bail


	
	This Court has jurisdiction under s 61 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) to grant bail. The definition of proceedings for an offence in s 5 include proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence.
	
	
	It is clear from the correspondence that the deferral by the Parole Authority of its consideration of the matter has been, at least since 2014, at the request of Mr Potier. Having successfully persuaded them again to defer consideration in May 2015 because Mr Potier had the result of neither of his appeals, he then sought to bring that consideration forward immediately after the decision of this Court was handed down on his conviction appeal. That seems to have been because of the importance to Mr Potier of appearance by AVL in the English proceedings at a hearing in July.
	
	
	At the hearing, the Court made clear to Mr Potier that it could not deal with any bail application in the absence of a representative of the Crown. In any event, Mr Potier would face a considerable hurdle in obtaining bail whilst he is held in prison parole refused. In the first place, he would need to show special or exceptional circumstances: s 22(1)(a).
	
	
	The application for bail is refused.
	


(3)   Appeal from Garling J


	
	Section 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) sets out the powers of the Court that may be exercised by a Judge of the Court. None of those enumerated matters includes the power of this Court to issue a criminal justice stay warrant under s 151 of the Migration Act. The better view is that Garling J had no power to hear Mr Potier’s application although the only significance of that, given that his Honour refused the application, is that there can be no appeal to this Court from his Honour’s determination. Section 22(2) is significant in that regard. It provides:
	


(2)   If the judge refuses an application on the part of the appellant to exercise any such power in the appellant’s favour, the appellant is entitled to have the application determined by the court. (emphasis added)

Whilst Garling J refused Mr Potier’s application it was not an application to exercise any power set out in s 22(1).


	
	In addition, this Court is a statutory court. It has only the jurisdiction given to it by any statute, principally the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Apart from s 22(2) its rights to hear any appeal appear only in sections 5 – 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act. None of those sections has any relevance to the present application.
	
	
	This application to appeal is refused.
	


(4)   Power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to issue a warrant


	
	Although Mr Potier accepts that he does not have the right to apply for the criminal justice stay warrant he seeks, he submitted that the Court should of its own motion issue such a warrant to prevent his deportation before the conclusion of his proceedings in this Court. He submitted that it is likely that he will be granted parole and then deported shortly afterwards. In his affidavit of 30 January 2015 he pointed to the fact that two days before the Parole Board was due to consider his parole he was required to speak to a Case Manager at Villawood Detention Centre.
	
	
	He submitted that it would be manifestly unfair for him to be deported before there is finality in relation to his criminal convictions. He relied on his application under r 50C as well as on his Pt 7 application to show that there is, as yet, no finality with regard to his convictions.
	
	
	Contrary to his earlier approach of persuading the Parole Board to adjourn consideration of his parole whenever a meeting of the Board was proposed, Mr Potier in his written submissions faxed to the Court on 11 June 2015 complained that the failure of the Parole Board to bring forward consideration of his parole and to grant it was causing a problem for him in conducting proceedings in the English courts. That submission appeared to provide a basis for him to submit that this Court ought to take the view that a criminal justice stay warrant was necessary in the interests of justice to conduct his outstanding proceedings both in New South Wales and in the United Kingdom.
	


Consideration


	
	The present position is that this Court has jurisdiction under s 151 of the Migration Act  to issue a warrant referred to in that section by reason of Mr Potier’s application under r 50C. Until the r 50C application is determined Mr Potier’s appeal must be regarded as not finalised.
	
	
	Section 151 provides:
	


Certain warrants stay removal or deportation

(1)  If an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported, this Act does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law a warrant to stay the removal or deportation.

(2)  If a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.

(3)  If a court issues a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen, the applicant for the warrant is responsible for the costs of any maintenance or accommodation (other than immigration detention) of the non-citizen while the warrant is in force.


	
	It is clear that nothing in the Migration Act imposes any obligation on the Court to issue such a warrant, nor does a person in the position of Mr Potier have any right to apply for such a warrant, a matter Mr Potier accepts. The section simply makes clear that the Court has the power to do so for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice. Such purposes would include the according of procedural fairness to a person in the position of Mr Potier. The matter is a discretionary decision for the Court.
	
	
	The r 50C application will be heard by the bench who heard the appeal from Mr Potier’s conviction. That bench (Ward & Simpson JJA and Wilson J) has directed that the application be determined on the papers and without any oral hearing. The parties have until a date in late August to lodge submissions.
	
	
	Since consideration of the r 50C application is to be dealt with on the papers there is no particular need for Mr Potier to stay in Australia to further that application. Although the time has not yet arrived for his submissions to be lodged the mistakes which he identifies in his application do not suggest that he would be unable to lodge submissions from outside Australia. No evidence has been led to suggest that he could not finalise these submissions prior to the next consideration of his parole on 13 August 2015 and certainly before any subsequent action is taken to deport him.
	
	
	Prior to the judgment of this Court of 3 June 2015 Mr Potier had submitted that he would need to be present in Australia in case a new trial was ordered by this Court. Although no submission to that effect was made in relation to his r 50C application, that could be the only basis for his needing to remain in Australia. The enquiry must be, therefore, about the likelihood of his r 50C application resulting in a different outcome for the appeal, and an outcome that resulted in a new trial being ordered. If Mr Potier cannot establish that he has reasonable prospects that the Court will order a new trial there would be no basis under s 151 for the Court to issue a stay warrant for the purposes of the administration of justice.
	
	
	The principles applicable to the consideration of a r 50C application have been comprehensibly considered in Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152 by Hoeben CJ at CL, R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreeing. Hoeben CJ at CL said this:
	


[28]   By reference to those decided cases, Rule 50C is of limited application with an emphasis on correcting obvious mistakes in language used or results that did not reflect the intention of the Court. Rule 50C has been used:

To correct a slip, being the omission of words to clarify an infelicitous or ambiguous expression. When doing so it was not altering the basis or rationale of the judgment as it was originally intended (R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSW CCA 195; 79 NSWLR 143 at [49].

To overcome agreed difficulties where there was a gap of three months from the conclusion of the notional sentence on a count and the commencement of the notional sentence on the next count and it was appropriate to remedy that slip (R v AB (No 2).

When the Court had not considered a ground of appeal (Baghdadi v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77).

To effect the orders proposed in the reasons for judgment with the correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence (Akkawi, Mark v R; Akkawi, Paul v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72).

To restructure sentences to achieve an aggregate non-parole period which reflected the Court’s intention (KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84).

To correct some minor accidental slips which included the numbering of the orders and some minor changes of wording, neither of which altered the substance of the reasons or the orders made (R v Ly (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 91).

[29]   Three of the cases discussed above involved the applicant seeking orders which amounted to an appeal against the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision. In Alramadan (No 2) the Court took the view that the applicant was seeking to re-open the appeal so as to remedy deficiencies in the material presented at the hearing and held that such an approach “would appear to fall squarely within the impermissible purpose of seeking “by a back door method” to re-argue an unsuccessful appeal”. It could not be justified on the criteria explained by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300; Alramadan (No 2) at [12].

[30]   In Kauwenberghs the Court did not consider that any of the issues in the grounds pursued by the applicant had been overlooked or were the subject of a misapprehension of a kind that enlivened the exercise of the Court’s power under Rule 50C. Similarly, in PFC it was held that the substance of the oral submissions was an attempt to re-argue the appeal and the entirety of the submissions did not demonstrate any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment.


	
	On their face the matters identified in paragraphs (a) to (e) of the Application under r 50C appear to be an attempt to reopen the appeal in a manner which simply enables the Applicant to reargue matters that were determined against him at the hearing of the appeal. The matters identified in paragraphs (a) to (d) were the four principal areas of dispute at the hearing of the appeal. They were dealt with comprehensively by Ward JA in her judgment with the agreement of Simpson J (as her Honour then was) and Wilson J. As framed, the errors are not said to be errors of form in the way Hoeben CJ at CL has categorised r 50C errors in Gall (No 2). They go only to the substance of what was decided in the Court’s judgment.
	
	
	This was made clear, no doubt unintended, by Mr Potier in his oral submissions in the present application. After Hoeben CJ at CL pointed out the limited nature of a r 50C application, Mr Potier said:
	


Well, your Honour, if that be the case, and I'm not wishing to in any suggestion argue with your Honour, if I take a very simple example and this, your Honour, will just have to accept that what I am saying is true, one of the very critical issues that the Court of Criminal Appeal did consider in the conviction appeal was the fact that they have listened to recordings that are correctly identified and filed before the Court. Now, in particular, the Court of Criminal Appeal in its decision said that they'd listened to a particular recording that was tendered before the Court and compared it with the transcripts. Now it is a fact, and not a disputed fact, that the particular recording which was the original recorded medium which was provided and tendered to the Court by myself in the appeal is entirely blank so that the Court of Criminal Appeal in that very simple instance has misunderstood what was before them in that they have almost certainly referred to recordings that were not tendered to reach an unfortunate mistake of fact in that they believed that the recordings had audio on them when they don't and that is not an issue of dispute. They do not, they are blank. And so if that recording ‑ and I am making these things as simple as I possibly can without extending this debate ‑ if that recording is blank and it has been found to be blank and if the Court has found that it had audio on it, which is clearly wrong, that is a mistake of fact and bearing in mind that that recording was the one of two recordings only given to the jury and those recordings were the only independent evidence of the offences being committed, your Honours would conclude that there is a degree of concern about the fact that that recording, if it is blank, as I attest it to be, and I believe that that is referred to in the judgment, if it is blank, then obviously that will directly affect the conviction deliberations. So I think I can point quite simply to a number of instances which, as I say, I could discuss ad nauseam with your Honour which would obviously need to be fleshed out properly…


	
	This issue was dealt with a number of times in the judgment, at [93], [109], [130], [136], [427], [523] and [590]. On the last mentioned occasion, the matter was being considered as part of an application by Mr Potier to lead further evidence about the matter. The application to lead the further evidence was rejected on the basis that it did not satisfy the test in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417. The assertion of a mistake relating to this matter in the r 50C application leads me to the view that what Mr Potier is seeking is a re-opening of his appeal and that he is not prepared to accept the carefully considered determination of the Court when it goes against him. A reading of the whole judgment discloses that this has been his approach throughout the whole course of his criminal proceedings.
	
	
	It is not clear what paragraph (e) is referring to. The judgment of the High Court in Potier v The Queen decided on 11 February 2013 ([2013] HCATrans 13) is not mentioned in the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment at all. The special leave application that gave rise to this judgment was referred to at [15] but only to mention that it was abandoned. Paragraph (e) may be a reference to a special leave application determined adversely to the Applicant on 6 September 2013 ([2013] HCATrans 207). That application appeared to concern Mr Potier’s complaint that material produced by Telstra was not available at the first trial, not the trial the subject of the recent determination by this Court.
	
	
	Ward JA dealt in some detail with this special leave application of 6 September 2013 at [16], [47], [72]-[73], [124], [147], [477], [483], [485]-[487] and [554] of her judgment. It is worth setting out some of those paragraphs to demonstrate again that Mr Potier is simply not prepared to accept determinations of courts which are unfavourable to him:
	


[72]   In the present proceedings, Mr Potier has submitted that the evidence that the Crown prosecutor had the Telstra material (prior to the end of the first trial) could not have been considered by the High Court when the special leave application was determined because it was not known at that stage that there had been a “deliberate withholding” of that information. However, the special leave application was in September 2013. Mr Potier accepts that he knew from around January 2005 that the call charge records (i.e., the Telstra material) had been received. Acting Superintendent Laidlaw had been cross-examined on this very issue in August 2006, well before the High Court special leave application in September 2013. The High Court application focussed on the Telstra material as being fresh evidence not available at the first trial. Therefore, any allegation as to the deliberate withholding of this material was one that could have been raised at that stage.

[73]   On the special leave application, Mr Brezniak conceded to the High Court that the call charge records were available by the time of the second trial. He accepted that the material that came to light close to the end of the first trial was that the three phones in the detention centre area to which Mr Potier had access were not the source of the calls and that there was no evidence as to whether the calls from the office of Mr Schofield, the officer within the detention centre’s telephone service, to which Mr Potier had access, might have been the source of the calls.

…

[483]   Insofar as issue is taken by Mr Potier with the manner in which the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2006 considered his complaint as to the telephone call recordings and maintains that his ground of appeal was not in fact determined (because of the mistake that the Crown concedes was made at [49] of the Court’s decision), he has been refused leave to appeal to the High Court in relation to those matters and the fact that he has sought to instigate an administrative inquiry into this is of no relevance to his present appeal.

[484]   For completeness, I note that the error in the 2006 appeal decision was that (at [49]), the presiding judge said:

… With respect to the Telstra material, the Crown tendered evidence on the appeal, which indicates that the relevant material was included in the Crown brief, which was provided to the appellant’s solicitors before the trial. Accordingly, any submission that the material is fresh evidence, which it could now be of assistance to the appellant, must be rejected.

[485]   The Crown concedes that the Telstra material was not included in the Crown brief provided to the defence before the trial and that this evidence emerged only towards the end of the trial. The Crown maintained, when this issue was raised before the High Court, that the Telstra material was not fresh evidence and did not meet the tests for the admission of fresh evidence set out in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63] (see submissions dated 13 May 2013 at [22]-[27]).

[486]   The High Court refused leave to appeal from the first convictions. Mr Potier nevertheless seeks to maintain in this appeal (based on his arguments as to the 2000 recordings) that the first conviction is no longer sustainable.

[487]   The dismissal of his application for special leave to appeal by the High Court in September 2013 means that Mr Potier has exhausted all the avenues of appeal in respect of his convictions for the 2000 offences. This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain any appeal from those convictions (Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436; Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; (2008) 238 CLR 218)….


	
	The other matters involving the Telstra Material, judicial bias and the admissibility of the first conviction were comprehensively dealt with by Ward JA. Mr Potier has not identified for the purposes of this hearing what the mistakes of fact and law are said to be. On the one hand, the way the complaints about mistakes are expressed suggest quite specific errors. On the other hand, the failure of Mr Potier to identify those errors leaves open the inference that the mistakes do not arise from specific errors – rather, he simply wishes to re-argue generally the matters put forward on the appeal which have already been determined unfavourably to him.
	
	
	Mr Potier accepted that, because he has no right to apply for the warrant under s 151, what he needs to do is to put forward all the facts and circumstances from which he can argue that this Court should of its own motion issue such a warrant. In such circumstances, there is an evidentiary onus on him, which is not lightly discharged, to justify the issue of a warrant. His failure to identify the errors to enable this Court to assess his prospects of success on these grounds means that he has not discharged that onus.
	
	
	Having regard to the limited nature of a r 50C application and the material put forward by Mr Potier I consider that he has a minimal prospect of achieving a different outcome in his appeal. He, therefore, fails to show that any purpose of the administration of criminal justice requires his presence in this country.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s reliance on his Pt 7 application is misconceived. Any enquiry conducted under this Part is an administrative, not a judicial function. Even if that is sufficient to provide a basis for a s 151 warrant whilst such enquiry is pending, the enquiry is conducted by the Supreme Court, not the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	After consideration of all of the material the Court declines to issue a criminal justice stay warrant.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The application to review the decision of the State Parole Authority is dismissed.
	
	
	The application to appeal from the judgment of Garling J of 15 August 2014 is dismissed.
	
	
	Release application dismissed and bail is refused.
	



	
	HAMILL J:   I agree with Davies J.

2702993,Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 206,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Damon Charles Miller, was found guilty by a jury of one count of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 178BA(1), and twenty counts of using a false instrument contrary to the Crimes Act, s 300(2). The charges related to a scheme whereby the appellant attempted to obtain a financial advantage to himself of $14,380,770 by pretending to be a solicitor and using false instruments to raise a mortgage upon an office block that he did not own and had no authority to deal with. The trial judge, Woodburne DCJ, sentenced the appellant to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.

The appellant’s defence at trial was that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was the person who had committed the offences. The Crown case relied on three forms of identification evidence: voice identification evidence of witnesses who had spoken to the perpetrator of the fraud and were asked to identify his voice from a set of eight samples; handwriting identification evidence by which the jury were provided with samples of writing, allegedly of the appellant, and asked to compare them with writing on documents related to the fraud, with the assistance of the opinion of an expert witness; and visual identification evidence of a number of witnesses that a person depicted on certain CCTV images was the appellant.

The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. He contended that the trial judge was in error in admitting the voice and visual identification evidence and the expert evidence relating to handwriting identification. In addition, he contended that the verdict was “unsafe and/or dangerous”, both in general and in relation to the voice identification evidence in particular. This was taken to be a reference to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The appellant also contended that a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the trial judge’s failure to discharge the jury in circumstances where a document containing prejudicial material was placed before them after the appellant inadvertently failed to object to it.

Per the Court, dismissing the appeal

(1) The only precondition for the admission of voice identification evidence is that it be relevant. Being relevant, the evidence here was admissible unless an order ought to have been made to exclude it under the Evidence Act, s 137. [42], [55]-[56].

R v Smith (1987) 7 NSWLR 444; R v Brownlowe (1987) 7 NSWLR 461; R v Adler [2000] NSWCCA 357; 116 A Crim R 38;  R v Riscuta [2003] NSWCCA 6.

(2) In determining an application to exclude voice identification evidence pursuant to s 137, the court must have regard to all the relevant circumstances including the conditions under which the recordings were made and the nature of the identification procedure used. In this case, these factors raised no unfair prejudice and the trial judge was not in error in admitting the evidence. To the extent that the voice identification evidence had certain weaknesses, including in relation to sound quality, those weaknesses were matters properly to be considered by the jury in their determination of the weight to be given to the evidence. [57]-[60], [100]-[108].

R v John [1975] Crim LR 456; R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61; 111 A Crim R 326; Alexander v The Queen [1981] HCA 17; 145 CLR 395. 

(3) The trial judge was not in error in admitting the evidence of the visual identification witnesses. As the witnesses knew the appellant at the time the video was recorded, they were in a better position than the jury to identify him, and their evidence was relevant and probative. The video itself, and still images taken from it, were also relevant and admissible. [109]-[114].

R v Smith [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650.

(4) In the circumstances that the unfair prejudice of material erroneously placed before the jury was limited, and the jury’s exposure to it occurred only for a brief period in a lengthy trial, the Court could be confident that the exposure did not affect the jury’s verdict such that the trial judge was not in error in failing to discharge them. [126]-[129].

Khazaal v R [2010] NSWCC 129; Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427; Maric v R (1978) 52 ALJR 631.

(5) The handwriting evidence, including the specimen documents for which there was only circumstantial evidence to support that they were written by the appellant, was relevant and admissible. It was a matter for the jury, having regard to the direct and circumstantial evidence, to accept or reject, that the specimen documents (or any of them) were written by the appellant. It was also a matter for the jury, on the basis of the expert evidence and their own assessment of the specimen documents as compared to the forged documents, to determine whether the appellant wrote the forged documents. [146]-[149].

(6) On the whole of the evidence relating to the voice, visual, and handwriting identification, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty, and s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act was therefore not engaged. [151]-[167].

M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2001] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250; Fleming v The Queen [1988] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250.

(7) In determining sentence, the question of what weight is to be given to particular considerations and facts is a matter for the trial judge. Her Honour was not in error in the weight she gave to specific deterrence in the circumstance that the appellant had a substantial history of fraud offences. [171]-[172].

(8) The trial judge’s determination of the appropriate non-parole period was not in error. No error was identified in her Honour’s consideration of questions of delay, time spent in custody or special circumstances and comparable cases were of little assistance. [173]-[179].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant, Damon Charles Miller, pleaded not guilty to one count of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception: the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 178BA(1), and twenty counts of using a false instrument: the Crimes Act, s 300(2). The former offence is now repealed. However, at the relevant time it carried a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The offence of using a false instrument carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.
	
	
	Each count on the indictment related to a scheme whereby the appellant defrauded the Uniting Church (NSW) Trust Association and attempted to obtain a financial advantage to himself of $14,380,770 by pretending to be a solicitor and using false instruments to raise a mortgage upon an office block that he did not own and had no authority to deal with. The appellant’s defence at trial was that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the person who had committed the offences.
	
	
	On 17 January 2013, a jury found him guilty on each count. The trial judge, Woodburne DCJ, sentenced the appellant to 10 years imprisonment commencing on 9 June 2013, with a non-parole period of 6 years. In her remarks on sentence, her Honour described the scheme as “an audacious one … marked by meticulous planning and careful execution”.
	
	
	The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. The application for leave to appeal and the appeal were heard concurrently.
	
	
	By an amended notice of appeal, the appellant contended, in relation to the appeal against conviction, that:
	


(1)   The verdict was unsafe and/or dangerous in all the circumstances of the proceedings;

(2)   The verdict was unsafe and/or dangerous in all circumstances of the proceedings where when comparing the evidence of voice identification of the witnesses:

(a)   Alice Candido

(b)   Roger Cornforth

(c)   Justine Innes

(d)   Tara Mullins

(e)   Zac Mircevski

(f)   Domarina Pireh

(g)   Paula Newton

with the evidence of the witness Callahan who was the only witness who was able to give a contemporaneous account of the characteristics of the voice of the appellant;

(3)   The Court erred in admitting the voice identification evidence of the persons specified in ground 2(a)-(g);

(4)   The Court erred in admitting the visual identification evidence of the appellant by the witnesses Ray Gall, Brett Gall, Nina Thongkumsai and Simone (Woollard) Hodges;

(5)   A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of her Honour’s failure to discharge the jury in circumstances where a document, Exh BA, which contained prejudicial material, was placed before the jury for the purposes of the handwriting identification evidence.

(6)   The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the handwriting expert Paul Westwood.

Ground 5 was a new ground of appeal, added by leave of the Court in the amended notice of appeal.


	
	The appellant submitted that if any of his grounds of appeal against conviction succeeded, there should be an order for a new trial.
	
	
	In his written submissions, the appellant identified the issue on the conviction appeal as follows:
	


“Whether the following evidence should have been admitted and that there was a miscarriage of justice as a consequence of the admission of the following:

a)   voice identification evidence;

b)   visual identification evidence; and

c)   identification handwriting evidence of Paul Dennis Westwood.”


	
	Save for the reference to “miscarriage”, there was no identification of an overarching ground that the verdict was unreasonable or was not supported by the evidence pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1). None of the written submissions were directed to such a ground. There were but vague references to ground 1 in oral argument. It should also be noted at the outset that the appellant did not refer the Court to any evidence that might support an ‘unsafe ground’, independently of the evidence to which the Court was taken in respect of grounds 2-4 and 6. We will return to this later in these reasons.
	
	
	Further, notwithstanding the formulation of ground 2, the relevant issue identified in the written submissions was the admissibility of the voice identification. As that argument was advanced in oral argument, it was that the evidence ought not to have been admitted pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 137.
	
	
	On the appeal against sentence, the appellant contended that:
	


(7)   The non-parole period was manifestly excessive; and

(8)   Excessive weight was placed upon the principle of specific deterrence.

Background facts


	
	For the purpose of understanding the general factual basis of the appeal, it is convenient to refer to the findings of fact made by her Honour and set out in her remarks on sentence delivered on 7 March 2013. The evidence adduced at the trial will be expressly considered as required by each of the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The offences related to an office building called Rugby House situated in North Sydney. The registered proprietor of the land was 181 Miller Street Pty Ltd (the Company). The directors of the Company included Allen Grant Linz and Mervyn Avron Bassarabie. Rugby House was the subject of a mortgage to the Perpetual Trustee Company and the certificate of title was held by the mortgagee’s solicitors.
	
	
	In about May 2004, the Company was seeking a purchaser for Rugby House. A copy of the contract of sale was available to prospective buyers. The appellant succeeded in obtaining a copy of that contract by indirect means, although the precise means by which he did so was unclear.
	
	
	In early November 2005, the appellant called an officer of the Uniting Church (NSW) Trust Association Pty Ltd (the Uniting Church), Paul Malek. The appellant used the name Geoffrey Penrose and represented himself to be the solicitor for the Company. He represented that the Company sought to borrow $15 million upon the security of Rugby House. Mr Malek referred the appellant to a mortgage broker, Zac Mircevski.
	
	
	The appellant, still using the name Geoffrey Penrose and holding himself out as the solicitor for the Company in relation to the loan, telephoned Mr Mircevski. Based on the information provided by the appellant, Mr Mircevski prepared a document headed “Indicative Funding Proposal” and emailed it to the appellant. On 12 December 2005, Mr Mircevski received from the appellant:
	



	
	The Indicative Funding Proposal purportedly sealed with the common seal of the Company and signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 2 on the indictment);
	
	
	A form of caveat to secure the payment of the mortgage broking fees, purportedly signed by Mr Linz as secretary of the Company (count 3 on the indictment).
	



	
	A few days later, the appellant sent to Mr Mircevski a document headed “Statement of Assets of Directors & Secretary of [the Company]” purportedly under the Company’s seal and signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 4 on the indictment).
	
	
	Mr Mircevski forwarded these documents to the Uniting Church. On 15 December 2005, Mr Mircevski received a letter from the Uniting Church containing a formal offer to the Company of a loan of $15 million on the security of a first registered mortgage over Rugby House. This letter was forwarded by email to the appellant (under the name of Geoffrey Penrose). The following day, Mr Mircevski received the offer back from the appellant, again purportedly under the Company’s seal and signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 5 on the indictment).
	
	
	On 19 December 2005, an officer of the Uniting Church received from the appellant a copy of the first page of the Contract for Sale by the Company of Rugby House, purportedly signed by Mr Linz (count 6 on the indictment). He forwarded this document to the solicitor for the Uniting Church, Roger Cornforth of Holman Webb. Mr Cornforth prepared the necessary mortgage documents for the purposes of the mortgage of Rugby House by the Company to the Uniting Church. Mr Cornforth telephoned the appellant, believing him to be Geoffrey Penrose, and arranged for the documents relating to the mortgage to be collected by him.
	
	
	On 21 December 2005, the appellant delivered or arranged the delivery of the following documents to Holman Webb:
	



	
	A letter headed “G Penrose Solicitor”, bearing an address in Spring Street, Sydney, dated 21 December 2005 and enclosing the documents listed in paras (2)-(7) below (count 7 on the indictment);
	
	
	A mortgage purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie as directors of the Company (count 8 on the indictment);
	
	
	A document headed “Important Notice to Guarantors”, purportedly signed by Mr Bassarabie (count 9 on the indictment);
	
	
	A statutory declaration dated 21 December 2005 purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 10 on the indictment);
	
	
	A document headed “Declaration by the Borrower” purportedly signed by Mr Bassarabie (count 11 on the indictment);
	
	
	A document headed “Authority Undertaking and Direction to Pay” dated 21 December 2005 purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 12 on the indictment); and
	
	
	A document headed “Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity” purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 13 on the indictment).
	



	
	On 23 December 2005, Mr Cornforth learned that there was a registered mortgage on the Certificate of Title to Rugby House in favour of Perpetual Trustee Company and a caveat lodged by Perpetual Trustee Company. The appellant provided a further letter to Mr Cornforth on 3 January 2006, which again bore the header “G Penrose Solicitor”, confirming that a Withdrawal of Caveat in registrable form would be provided upon the settlement of the mortgage to the Uniting Church (this conduct was the subject of count 14 on the indictment).
	
	
	Another bundle of documents was delivered to Mr Cornforth on 12 January 2006, including:
	



	
	A covering letter dated 9 January 2006 headed “G Penrose Solicitor” (count 15 on the indictment);
	
	
	A document headed “Direct Debit Request” purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie (count 16 on the indictment); and
	
	
	Two documents headed “Record of a Signatory to an Account” purportedly signed by Messrs Linz and Bassarabie respectively (counts 17 and 18 on the indictment).
	



	
	In reliance on these documents, Mr Cornforth wrote to Mr Malek on 16 January 2006, informing him that the Uniting Church would obtain full and complete security pursuant to the mortgage over Rugby House. Mr Malek then caused cheques to be drawn on behalf of the Uniting Church for the purpose of making the mortgage advance. A cheque for the sum of $14,380,717 was drawn in favour of Jaggard’s Trading Pty Ltd (Jaggard’s), a dealer in gold in Sydney. Settlement of the mortgage took place that same day at the premises of the Law Society in Phillip Street, Sydney.
	
	
	A clerk from Legalink Law Stationers was present, purportedly on behalf of the Company, as instructed by the appellant by letter dated 4 January 2009. For the purposes of the settlement, the clerk had received from the appellant:
	



	
	A forged certificate of title purportedly issued by the Registrar-General of New South Wales (count 19 on the indictment);
	
	
	A purported withdrawal of caveat that had been lodged in the Registry of the Registrar-General by the Perpetual Trustee Company (count 20 on the indictment); and
	
	
	A purported discharge of mortgage in favour of Perpetual Trustee Company (count 21 on the indictment).
	



	
	The clerk from Legalink handed these documents to a clerk from Holman Webb, the solicitors for the Uniting Church. In return, the clerk from Legalink received a cheque for the mortgage brokerage firm of Mr Mircevski and the bank cheque in favour of Jaggard’s. On instruction from the appellant, the Legalink clerk arranged for that cheque to be specially cleared.
	
	
	Meanwhile, commencing in September 2005, in communications with Robert Jaggard, the principal of Jaggard’s, the appellant had been posing as another solicitor by the name of John Fisher, of the firm J Fisher and Associates at Spring Street, Sydney (the same address as used by G Penrose). As John Fisher, the appellant had represented that he had a client interested in investing in gold and through that pretence had obtained bank account details for Jaggard’s. In a telephone conversation on 4 January 2006, the appellant had told Mr Jaggard that the purchase of approximately $14 million of gold would go ahead, and on 15 January 2006, he told Mr Jaggard that $14,389,717 was deposited into the bank account of Jaggard’s.
	
	
	After the deposits were cleared, Jaggard’s purchased over $14 million worth of gold coins and gold bullion. Gold to the value of over $7 million was transported from Western Australia to the depot of Brinks Security in Alexandria, Sydney. The appellant, using the name Matthew, then arranged for a courier, Haider Khalid, to collect the gold and deliver it to an address in Ashfield on 20 January 2006. On 19 January 2006, the appellant used a computer at the Airport Hotel Inn, Arncliffe, to email Mr Gao, the manager of Jaggard’s, to inform him that Mr Khalid would be collecting the gold on his behalf. The email was sent at 12.23 pm. The appellant supplied Mr Gao with a fake ABN for J Fischer and Associates.
	
	
	In CCTV footage recorded at the Airport Hotel Inn between 12.18 pm and 12.36 pm, the person who had sent the email was filmed entering the Inn, walking through to the computer and leaving the Inn. The time as recorded on the CCTV footage was 11.18 am-11.36 am. However, the manager of the hotel gave evidence that the CCTV camera had not been adjusted to take account of daylight saving time. Still photographs were produced from the CCTV footage. Both the CCTV footage and the photographs were in evidence.
	
	
	There was evidence that as at the time of trial, the appellant’s appearance had changed in that he had lost significant weight. Six persons who knew the appellant as at January 2006 gave evidence that they recognised the person in the photographs derived from the CCTV footage as the appellant.
	
	
	Mr Khalid was unable to collect the gold as intended on 20 January 2006. The appellant, again pretending to be the solicitor for the owners of the gold, had a number of telephone conversations with Tara Mullins at Brinks Security about the delivery of the gold to an address in Spring Street, Sydney. Brinks Security was unwilling to deliver the gold to that address because they were not satisfied with the security of those premises.
	
	
	On 23 January 2006, a police officer, Mark Callanan, telephoned the mobile number used by the offender under both the names Geoffrey Penrose and John Fisher. When the police officer spoke to the appellant and asked him to come to the police station to sort the matter out, the offender rang off and apparently switched off the mobile phone.
	
	
	On 24 January 2006, an officer at the Department of Lands declined to register the mortgage in favour of the Uniting Church, the purported discharge of mortgage, or the purported withdrawal of caveat, on the basis that the Certificate of Title presented was not genuine.
	
	
	Between 2004 and 2006, the appellant had assumed a number of other false identities for the purposes of furthering his fraud. These included:
	



	
	The appellant, calling himself Peter Cohen and pretending to be a solicitor, obtained a copy of the first page of the contract of sale from Allan Botros, a prospective buyer of Rugby House;
	
	
	In mid-2004, the appellant, calling himself Don Bruce and representing himself to be a solicitor and a director of the Company, consulted Alicia Candido, a mortgage broker, about obtaining a financial facility of about $50 million against Rugby House;
	
	
	In mid-2005, the appellant, calling himself Andrew and representing himself to be a solicitor for clients interested in purchasing Rugby House, telephoned Justine Innes of Rebel Property Group, the manager of Rugby House, asking for a copy of the contract of sale. Ms Innes refused, and referred the appellant to Chesterton International, the selling agents for Rugby House;
	
	
	On about 19 December 2005, the appellant, calling himself Peter Davis and representing himself to be the solicitor for a purchaser of Rugby House, telephoned Paula Newton, a solicitor for Perpetual Trustee Company, and asked for information about the Certificate of Title and whether he could come to her office to see it. Ms Newton refused, but emailed him a scanned copy of three pages of the Certificate of Title;
	
	
	In January 2006, the appellant, calling himself John Fisher and representing himself to be a solicitor, asked Bevan Kenny, of Chesterton International, for a copy of the contract of sale of Rugby House. Mr Kenny declined to provide it.
	



	
	In summary, as observed by the trial judge in her remarks on sentence, in the course of dishonestly attempting to obtain a financial benefit of over $14 million, the appellant assumed seven false names: Geoffrey Penrose, John Fisher, Matthew, Peter Cohen, Don Bruce, Andrew Davis and Peter Davis, and used 20 false documents, the subject of counts 2 to 21. He made false representations that he was a solicitor, used false addresses, and provided a false ABN.
	
	
	The gold was ultimately recovered on behalf of the Uniting Church. Although the loss resulting from the offences was not particularised by the Crown at trial, evidence was led that innocent parties had borne costs associated with the raising of the mortgage, the discovery of the crime and the recovery of the proceeds, including by legal action.
	


The Crown case


	
	There were three significant evidentiary prongs to the Crown case. The first was voice identification evidence of 10 witnesses who had spoken to the perpetrator of the fraud and were asked to identify his voice from a set of eight samples. The second was handwriting identification evidence, by which the jury were provided with samples of writing, allegedly of the appellant, and asked to compare them to writing on a number of documents related to the fraud. The third was visual identification evidence whereby witnesses gave evidence that the appellant was the person depicted on CCTV images taken at the Airport Inn.
	


Grounds 2 and 3: the voice identification evidence


	
	For the purpose of the voice identification procedure, a sample recording of the appellant’s voice from a prior court hearing was obtained. The sample recording was 20 seconds long and was assembled from three separate sections of the court recording. The police also obtained recordings of seven other persons reading the transcript of what the appellant had said on the recording of his voice. The 10 witnesses to whom the appellant had spoken to in the course of engaging in the conduct subject of the various offences were then asked to listen to the eight recordings and to identify whether they recognised any recording as being that of the person to whom they had spoken over the phone. The recording of the appellant’s voice was placed in a different order for each of the various witnesses.
	
	
	Seven witnesses, being the persons specified in ground 2 of the amended notice of appeal, identified the appellant’s voice as being the voice of, or similar to the voice of, the person to whom they had spoken. Three witnesses, Mr Malek, Mr Jaggard and Mr Gao, did not identify, or correctly identify, the appellant’s voice.
	
	
	As we understand the appellant’s oral argument, he challenged the voice recognition evidence on three bases:
	


(1)   the evidence was not relevant: see the Evidence Act, s 55, and it ought therefore not to have been admitted;

(2)   the trial judge ought to have refused to admit the evidence pursuant to the Evidence Act, s 137;

(3)   the verdict should be set aside on the basis that it was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.


	
	The admissibility of the voice identification evidence of the seven witnesses who had identified the appellant’s voice as that of the person to whom they had spoken had been the subject of a pre-trial ruling by Tupman DCJ. Her Honour ruled that the evidence was admissible. In making that ruling, her Honour was satisfied that there was sufficient similarity in the eight voices on the recordings, including that of the appellant.
	
	
	Her Honour noted there was “some small distinction” between the recording of the appellant’s voice and the others and that his voice was perhaps more distant than the others. Her Honour remarked, however, that “it is far from clear that that is the way it was heard” by each of the witnesses when they engaged in the voice recognition process.
	
	
	It is apparent from the language of her Honour’s judgment that the application challenged the relevance of the evidence: see the Evidence Act, s 55; and whether its probative value outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice: the Evidence Act, s 137.
	
	
	No application was made to the trial judge pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 130A to resist the admissibility of the evidence. The arguments advanced on the appeal substantially replicated the arguments that had been made to Tupman DCJ at the pre-trial hearing. No additional arguments were advanced that the evidence was not relevant pursuant to the Evidence Act, s 55, nor could such argument have been made. The evidence was relevant, as it went directly to the jury’s assessment of the probability that the appellant was the offender. The main issue relating to the voice identification evidence was therefore the claim that it should have been excluded pursuant to s 137. We deal with the ‘unsafe’ challenge later in these reasons.
	


Is leave to raise these grounds required?


	
	The appellant informed the Court that he needed leave pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4, to raise grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal. This submission was premised upon an erroneous understanding that the appellant required leave to raise the challenge to the admissibility of the evidence pursuant to s 137, a misunderstanding that was perhaps induced by a comment made by the Crown to the appellant’s counsel. As discussed above, there was a challenge to the admissibility of the voice recognition evidence that was heard and determined pre-trial. It is to be assumed that trial counsel considered that there was no basis to re-challenge the admissibility of that evidence before the trial judge: see the Criminal Procedure Act, s 130A. Certainly, no such application was made. Accordingly, leave was not required pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4, as the issue of the admissibility of the evidence had been made in accordance with the pre-trial procedures under the Criminal Appeal Act.
	


Legal principles


	
	Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides that:
	


“In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”


	
	The phrase “probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as follows:
	


“… probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.”


	
	The proper construction of s 137 was considered by this Court in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112. The Court (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing) held that, subject to the limited circumstances referred to below, s 137 is not concerned with the credibility or reliability of the evidence sought to be adduced. Rather, the assessment of the probative value of the evidence should be approached on the assumption that the evidence would be accepted.
	
	
	Spigelman CJ stated, at [61], the word “could” in the definition of “probative value” directed attention to “what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude … [and not] to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude”. His Honour noted that this was consistent with the preponderance of authority in this Court, which was in favour of a “restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and creditability are to be taken into account”. Any other approach would risk usurping critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury: at [64].
	
	
	The limited circumstance in which credibility or reliability may be relevant to the assessment of probative value was where it was possible for the court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue: at [63].
	
	
	The Court in Shamouil also dealt with the meaning of “unfair prejudice” in s 137. Spigelman CJ, at [72], stated that, for the purposes of s 137, prejudice must be “unfair”, that is:
	


“There must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way and that that risk will exist notwithstanding the proper directions which it should be assumed the Court will give.”


	
	These principles were affirmed in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 12. There had been a challenge in XY to the principle stated in Shamouil that, subject to the limited exception referred to above, at [48], s 137 was not concerned with the credibility or reliability of the evidence. On that question, a majority of a five judge bench (Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson J) upheld the reasoning in Shamouil and did not follow the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Dupas v R [2012] VSCA 328 in which Shamouil was held, at [68], to be “manifestly wrong”.  
	
	
	The appellant did not go so far in this case as challenging the correctness of Shamouil. It should be noted that as between the judges in XY there were slightly divergent views as to the reach of the principle: see Basten JA at [65]; Hoeben CJ at CL at [86]-[89]; Simpson J (as her Honour then was) at [161]-[162]; Blanch J at [189]-[204]. See also Price J at [224]-[225]. However, the outcome of this case would be the same on any view. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to state any concluded view in respect of the differences in these various judgments. We would also note that the outcome would be the same if the principles from Dupas were applied to the facts of this case.
	
	
	“Identification evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as including aural identification. It means evidence that is:
	


“(a)   an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where:

(i)   the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or

(ii)   an act connected to that offence was done,

at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or

(b)   a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion.” (emphasis added)


	
	Sections 116 and 165 of the Evidence Act apply to aural identification evidence. Section 116 provides:
	


“(1)   If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury:

(a)   that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence, and

(b)   of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case.

...”

No complaint was made as to the directions given by the trial judge to the jury, nor was it otherwise suggested that s 116 had been infringed.


	
	Section 165 provides, relevantly, for warnings relating to the reliability of identification evidence to be given to the jury, on the request of a party. No request was made by the appellant or the Crown to give a warning or inform the jury of any of the matters referred to in s 165.
	
	
	At common law, it was held that in some circumstances there was a threshold admissibility requirement for voice identification evidence that the voice heard had some distinctive feature or the witness had sufficient prior familiarity with it: R v Smith (1987) 7 NSWLR 444; R v Brownlowe (1987) 7 NSWLR 461. Any such requirements did not survive the enactment of the Evidence Act: R v Adler [2000] NSWCCA 357; 116 A Crim R 38 at [13]-[14] per Smart AJ, Heydon JA and Ireland AJ agreeing.
	
	
	It follows that under the Evidence Act the only precondition for the admission of voice identification evidence is the requirement in s 55(1) that it be relevant. If the evidence is relevant, it is admissible unless an order is made to exclude it under ss 135, 137 or 138: R v Riscuta [2003] NSWCCA 6 at [34]. Only s 137 was relied upon by the appellant.
	
	
	Some assistance in determining whether evidence should be rejected as unfairly prejudicial may be derived from cases of visual identification in which the accused, or a photograph of the accused, is significantly different from its comparators. In R v John [1975] Crim LR 456, the appellant was the only person in an identification parade wearing a leather jacket. While the English Court of Appeal was critical of this fact, it dismissed an appeal, holding that the witnesses based their identification on what they remembered of the appellant’s face and dress really played no part in it.
	
	
	In R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61; 111 A Crim R 326, a photographic identification procedure was undertaken in which a witness was shown 12 photographs including one of the accused. The photograph of the accused was the only photograph depicting a person with a goatee-style beard. The witness had given evidence that he recalled the offender as having a goatee-style beard. In addition, the photograph of the accused gave the impression of having been substantially cut down for the purpose of the identification examination. Sheller JA, with whom James and Dowd JJ agreed, held that the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s 137. His Honour stated, at [25], that:
	


“I do not see how it could be said that an identification obtained by such a process was of great probative value. At the same time it results in unfair prejudice to the appellant. But it was not the probative weight of the evidence which gave rise to the prejudice … The prejudice to the appellant remained high although the method of obtaining the identification evidence greatly diminished its probative value. There lay its unfairness.”


	
	In Alexander v The Queen [1981] HCA 17; 145 CLR 395 at 400, Gibbs CJ made a related point in relation to identification parades:
	


“… it goes without saying that precautions must be taken to ensure that no prompting, suggestion or hint is given to the witness that any particular member of the group is the suspect.”


	
	Although not directly in point, these cases demonstrate that the court must have regard to all relevant circumstances in making a determination under s 137, including the conditions under which the recordings were made and the processes associated with the identification.
	


The appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that the voice identification evidence was flawed in the manner in which it was produced both as to the quantity and quality of the recording and was therefore unfair. This was apparent, on his submission, by a comparison of the circumstances in which the recording of his voice was obtained and the manner in which it was put together as compared to what occurred in the production of the voice recordings of the other persons.
	
	
	The appellant’s particular complaints were as follows:
	


(1)   The use of only one twenty second voice sample constituted significant prejudice.

(2)   The sample of the appellant’s voice could be contrasted in significant ways with the other voice samples. In particular, use of a sample assembled from three separate segments resulted in there being unnatural pauses in the recording and two audible clicks where the segments had been joined. By contrast to the appellant’s recording, there was no break in the recordings of the other seven persons reading the transcript and accordingly it did not come across in the disjointed way that the recording of the appellant’s voice did. Further, the recording of the appellant’s voice had been taken from a recording when he was making a statement to a judge in an open courtroom with surrounding noise, whereas the other recordings were done in a room where there was no background noise.

(3)   A number of the witnesses had commented upon the difficulty in identifying the voice, such that their evidence ought not to have been accepted as a positive identification that the voice was that of the person to whom they had spoken. This complaint was limited to the “disjointed cut and paste” in the recording of the appellant’s voice, the background noise and the proximity of the microphone to the speakers. In this regard, the appellant complained that in the recording taken of his voice, he had been at some distance from the microphone, whereas it was apparent that the other speakers were speaking close to the microphone. He also pointed out that the other persons produced their voice samples at varying speeds.

(4)   There was no relevant comparability between the appellant’s voice and the other voices, the only similar characteristic being that those persons were drawn from the finance industry. The consequence of the limited basis upon which the selection was made was that “the listener gravitates towards the recording which is least like the others”. This argument, which was advanced in the appellant’s written submission, was not relied on in oral argument, where the appellant stated that he did not assert that the choice of voices chosen for the purposes of the voice identification evidence was unfair.

(5)   Using witnesses’ memories approximately three years after the time of the offence was highly prejudicial.

(6)   The conversations between the actual perpetrator of the criminal acts and the witnesses had occurred over a different medium, namely, the telephone, and that had not been replicated in the voice identification evidence. Nor had any expert evidence been called to explain the differences between sound across that medium and the sound of voices being recorded directly onto disc with the use of a microphone.

(7)   The fact that seven of the 10 voice identification witnesses identified the appellant’s voice had the potential that the jury would treat the evidence of those witnesses as more credible simply by force of numbers.

(8)   The jury was not been told until the Crown’s closing address that the voice of the accused was put together in three segmented pieces taken from his evidence in a civil trial.

(9)   The police did not clarify sufficiently whether any of the witnesses knew each other, whether they were comfortable in identifying with certainty the voice of a person with whom they had not spoken for three years, or the number of times that they had spoken to the perpetrator.


	
	Notwithstanding these various submissions, the appellant’s primary complaint remained that the recording of his voice was objectively differentiated from the others in that it had been produced in three segments, such that there may have been some subconscious impact on the witness’ perceptions at the time that they identified his voice. The appellant submitted, therefore, that the “frailty and fragileness” of the voice identification evidence was such that it should have been excluded by the trial judge pursuant to s 137. He submitted that the evidence was not reliable and that its prejudicial nature was such that any direction that the trial judge gave could not satisfactorily negate it.
	


Was there any unfairness in the production of the voice identification evidence?


	
	Certain of the complaints made by the appellant as to the unfairness of the manner in which the voice identification evidence was obtained are not made out, or are directly contradicted by the evidence.
	
	
	Thus, his complaint that the surroundings in which the recordings were obtained were significantly different, his in a noisy court room and the others in quiet controlled surroundings, so as to create an obvious difference in the quality of the recording was contradicted by the evidence of Detective Schussler. Detective Schussler gave evidence that the sample voices were recorded at Parramatta Court “because the voice recording of [the appellant] took place in a courtroom”.
	


The evidence of Mr Mircevski, Ms Candido and Ms Pireh


	
	In support of his contention that the other recordings were made with the speaker being close to the microphone, the appellant placed particular reliance upon the evidence of Mr Mircevski, Ms Candido and Ms Pireh, each being witnesses who had identified the appellant’s voice during the course of the voice identification process.
	
	
	As explained below, a consideration of the evidence including the video taken of these witnesses in undertaking the voice identification process, either does not support this contention or alternatively, demonstrates that any technical differences in the recordings did not affect the identification the witnesses made of the appellant’s voice.
	
	
	It was also apparent that some of the supposed concessions made by these witnesses that the appellant contended supported this aspect of his case related to matters to which they agreed in the witness box after the recordings had been played to them in court. Such concessions, if that is how they are appropriately described did not undermine and sometimes reinforced, the voice identification evidence itself.
	


The evidence of Mr Mircevski


	
	During the course of the voice identification process, Mr Mircevski identified the voice on the second recording as being the most familiar. He said he was “pretty sure the other ones aren’t recognisable”. He asked to listen to the second recording again. Having done so, he said:
	


“That’s the most familiar. There are facets of the voice, well spoken sort of posh type accent that’s … I mean I haven’t heard it for two and a half years but it sounds the most familiar.”


	
	Mr Mircevski was asked whether he remembered the name of the person whose voice sounded most familiar. He responded:
	


“Geoff Penrose was his alias. That’s why it is so familiar because of the S’s and stuff like that they were very like ‘Geoff Penrose’, you know sort of dragging, it’s the most familiar.”


	
	The recording of the appellant’s voice was played to Mr Mircevski during the course of his cross-examination, in respect of which Mr Mircevski gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   Now in relation to that voice I’m going to suggest to you that you were able to detect on that a lot of background noise?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The voice also sounded quite tinny?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it was markedly a much more distant sounding voice that that which you heard on the first tape?

A.   Correct.

Q.   It was also soft?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And it wasn’t a clearly distinctive Australian accent?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And finally Mr Mircevski, the voice itself didn’t conclude any word with a pronunciation of the last syllable of words where there was more than one. Now before I leave that point I wish to draw your attention to the evidence which you gave before, which was that in relation to the person he pronounced the word, last part of his words and you used the example ‘Penroze’, remember that?

A.   That’s right

Q.   But in that particular voice you couldn’t hear that, could you?

A.   Well, there was accentuation of the s’s which was what I was alluding to.

Q.   Yes. On three words there was an accentuation of the s’s at the beginning but there was no, I think you just agreed with me, that there was no accentuation of the last syllable of the word, using the example ‘Penrose’ as ‘Penroze’?

A.   Well that could have been my pronunciation. I mean if I can explain my answer, if I’m listening to The Beatles on a CD or if I’m listening to them on the tape they are The Beatles one way or another. And that was the most familiar voice, and the voice and the characteristics of the voice. Whether it was effectively my inability to be able to describe that voice is another thing. All I can assure is that was the most familiar voice to me and reminded me of my discussions with Penrose.”


	
	In further cross-examination about the recording of voice 2, Mr Mircevski said that he had noticed a stopping and starting between each of the three sentences. However, he clarified his observation that that was something he had just noticed when the recording was played to him whilst giving his evidence. Mr Mircevski also said that, at the time that he was participating in the voice recognition process, his “focus was on describing the tape or trying to find a voice that was familiar to me”. He said that he was looking for facets of the voice that he could recognise.
	


The evidence of Ms Candido


	
	Ms Candido recognised the appellant’s voice as soon as it was played during the voice identification process. She said that it sounded exactly like the person that she had spoken to on the phone. She also said that she did not think she would remember anything “back that far”, but that it was “quite clear … very, very clear to me”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Candido agreed that the voice that she recognised as the voice of the person to whom she spoken on the phone “seemed a little bit distant”. However, she responded that that was not something that she recalled listening for. She was “looking for a voice that I recognised”. Ms Candido also agreed that the voice that she had identified appeared “to be presented in segments rather than in a single reading”. However, she said that that was not something that she “noticed at the time … that wasn’t my thought process”.
	
	
	In her statement prepared following her participation in the voice identification procedure, Ms Candido had referred to pauses “between the words and the sentences in the voice sample” as being “exactly like the same as the pauses in the speech of [the person she had spoken to on the telephone]”. When asked about this in cross-examination, she said:
	


“… the pauses were distinctive enough. It wasn’t just of the pauses in the speech, it was the mannerism, it was the whole thing. I mean it was recognisable. As soon as I heard the voice, I know this voice, you know so a distinction.”


	
	Counsel for the appellant at trial suggested to her that it was reasonably possible that she had made a mistake. She replied, “Yeah, that is a possibility”. She also acknowledged that on hearing the recordings in court, the recording of the appellant’s voice had a lot of background noise on it and that she could not remember any of the other voices having background noise.
	


The evidence of Ms Pireh


	
	Ms Pireh agreed in cross-examination that the recording of the appellant’s voice played in court had breaks in it and sounded slightly tinny, and that at the previous hearing she said that the voice she identified sounded like the person to whom she had spoken on the phone, but that she could not be “a hundred percent sure”. At the previous hearing, she also identified the person to whom she had been speaking as being “maybe in late 50s”.
	
	
	Ms Pireh initially said that she had not heard any strong background noise but, on the recording being replayed in court, she agreed that she heard background noise in the sample of the appellant’s voice, but not in the others.
	


The evidence of the other voice identification witnesses


	
	It is convenient to consider the evidence of all the voice identification witnesses at this point.
	
	
	No specific complaint was directed to the evidence of the other four witnesses who identified the appellant’s voice as that of the person to whom they had spoken. However, their evidence contained some of the same concessions as the evidence of Mr Mircevski, Ms Candido and Ms Pireh.
	


The evidence of Mr Cornforth


	
	Mr Cornforth gave evidence that he had spoken on the telephone to a man identifying himself as Mr Penrose, and representing himself to be a solicitor acting for the Company, on three to six occasions.
	
	
	The transcript of the voice identification procedure (Exh CL) records that Mr Cornforth noted that:
	


“… the voice used [at the time of the phone conversations] was quite exaggerated, almost… it was quite an exaggerated accent but I can see a resemblance between voice seven and the voice I heard at that time.”


	
	Also in evidence was a witness statement of 8 July 2008 signed by Mr Cornforth in which he stated that the voice he had heard on the telephone “was distinctive in that it was the voice of a person who had some legal training or exposure to legal offices. The speech … was exaggerated”. In cross-examination, Mr Cornforth agreed that when he said the person on the phone “had some legal training or exposure to legal officers”, his statement had nothing to do with the sound of the voice. He agreed that, at the committal hearing, he had given evidence that “the voice [on the telephone] was exaggerated to create that impression of culture and professionalism”, but said that was saying the same thing as he had said at the voice identification procedure.
	
	
	Mr Cornforth denied the proposition that, given the number of similar conversations he had had in the five-year intervening period, there was no way he could possibly remember what a single person’s voice sounded like. Mr Cornforth said that he did not recall the voice sample he identified as having a lot of background noise or giving the impression that there were three sets of voices on the track. He agreed that, when he was played the sample during Local Court proceedings and specifically asked to concentrate on that issue, he had agreed that there did appear to be two breaks in which the audio was cut and pasted. However, he said that when the tape was played in at the voice identification procedure and at the District Court proceedings in 2011, he could not discern a difference.
	


The evidence of Ms Mullins


	
	In the voice identification procedure, Ms Mullins also chose the voice of the appellant as being most like that of the man she had spoken to on the phone, but noted that she “couldn’t be sure with the length of time”.
	
	
	Ms Mullins agreed that she had described the voice on the telephone as being “authoritative”, “impatient”, “anxious to get the business underway” and as having “a bit of an Australian accent”. She agreed that, in the two years from the time of the conversation to the time of the voice identification procedure, she would have come across people “all the time” whose voices could be described in that way.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Mullins agreed that, on the telephone, she was not actually listening so much to the quality of the voice but the types of things being said. However, she also said that:
	


“… because of the circumstances of the shipment and I started to fear that something, there might be risk there or there might be something wrong so … that’s why the, the conversation and the circumstances of the shipment in particular stood out more than any other would.”


	
	Ms Mullins also gave the following evidence relating to the sound quality of the recordings:
	


“Q. Now, in listening to those tapes, and I'm going to direct your attention to tape number 6, did you notice that there was a significant amount of background noise?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you notice that there was not a significant amount of background noise on the others?

A. Yes.”

The evidence of Ms Newton


	
	Ms Newton gave a statement in which she described the voice sample of the appellant, as being “very similar” to the voice of the man she had heard on the phone. She gave evidence in cross-examination that that was the best that she could recall some two and a half years after the telephone conversation.
	
	
	In cross-examination, in the course of being replayed the samples of the various voices, Ms Newton gave the following evidence relating to the tone the voice and the sound quality of the recording of the appellant’s voice:
	


“Q. Now, you agree that the whole tone of that voice sounds different to the first two?

A. Yes.

Q. Sounds tinny?

A. I would say it's a little bit more distant.

Q. Thank you, that's what I was going to put to you; and there's a lot of background noise?

A. There is a little bit of background noise, yes.

Q. Sounds pretty much like a bad tape?

A. Yes.

Q. And you'd notice that the voice was much softer than the other two?

A. Not as, yes, but still clear, still can hear it quite well--

Q. Yes--

A. You can hear the words.

Q. You can hear the words quite well?

A. Yes.

Q. Yes, and you would have also noticed that unlike the other two, that there was lots of pauses in between them?

A. I didn't notice lots of pauses, but not as robust, that's how I would have said it.

…

Q. … none of the voices except for voice 3 sounded distant, did it?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. That's not the way he sounded to you on the phone to you when he spoke to you, was it?

A. I can't remember if he sounded distant that day, no.”

The evidence of Ms Innes


	
	Ms Innes gave evidence that, in 2005 while working for Rebel Property Group, which managed and marketed buildings including Rugby House, she received a telephone call from a man claiming to be a solicitor named Andrew and to be acting on behalf of clients who were interested in purchasing the property. She said that she refused his request to be given the Information Memorandum relating to the building and other marketing material they had, as this material was only provided to legitimate buyers acting through agents. She took his telephone number so as to have an agent call him but when she called the number it was disconnected.
	
	
	Ms Innes agreed that the phone conversation was fairly short, and that it occurred 30-32 months prior to her statement to the police. She said she had considered the voice in the time prior to that statement, however, noting that “[i]t did come back to mind as soon as we’d heard what happened, that was way soon”. She disagreed that because she had been in contact with professional people in her job on a frequent basis it would be difficult for her to say what voice it was that she had heard. She explained that most of the professional contact in her job was with solicitors whom she knew, and that she would “remember most people that make an impression and this gentleman made an impression”.
	
	
	Ms Innes described the man she heard on the telephone as “introverted … evasive in his tone and he frequently paused during the conversation”. When asked in cross-examination what she meant by “introverted”, she explained that she meant “somebody who’s not open … they’re thinking in their head what they’re trying to work out … trying to read what’s coming at them”.
	
	
	Ms Innes found voice samples 1 and 4 to be the voices she most recognised. The following exchange occurred between Ms Innes and the interviewing police officer during the voice identification procedure:
	


“[Sample 4 played for a second time]

Innes: Sounds like the same guy [as voice 1], just sounds like it is further away. Someone didn’t get close enough with a microphone or something.

… One and Four sound very very… they almost sound the same except for the fact that one was a really bad recording from a long way away and looked like it was cut and pasted together…

…

Innes: Number four was clearly much more poor quality recording or the distance from the microphone was greater than all the others … number four was just not such a good recording.

…

[Interviewer]: If you had to choose between one and four?

Innes: Let me listen to them again. The difficulty is the quality difference, that’s the difficulty.

[Samples 1 and 4 played again]

Innes: I would probably have to choose four but I wouldn’t be a hundred per cent confident. I can’t even remember what year it was. 2004 I guess? That’s like forever.”


	
	In cross-examination, Ms Innes was asked about her reference to sample 4 sounding as though it was “cut and pasted together”. She explained that she had heard a click between paragraphs of the sample, and that unlike all the other samples it sounded like it was not recorded in one continuous recording, although it was clearly the same voice. When asked whether it had become “fairly obvious” that the sample was the only one in which there was a click, she said that she did not listen for the click with the others. When asked about the quality of the recordings, Ms Innes said that:
	


“1 and 4 at the time had a similar tone and style, pausing was much more similar than any of the others. Not so distinctly different. And what I was really saying is if number 4 had been of an equal quality I would have been able to give a much clearer choice”

The evidence of Mr Malek, Mr Jaggard, Mr Gao and Detective Callanan


	
	Mr Malek, of the Uniting Church (NSW) Trust Association, could not positively identify any of the voices. He said that voice 3, which was not the appellant’s, sounded familiar, but he could not be certain.
	
	
	Mr Jaggard, of Jaggard’s, the gold trader, selected the voice of another participant (voice 1 on the tape played to him), stating that if he had to pick one that was similar or a little bit similar it was possibly voice 1.
	
	
	Mr Gao said that the voices sounded similar. He said that the person called Mr Fisher, to whom he spoke, “was very well spoken and there is [a] few in here that can’t even read off the sheets properly”. He nominated three of the voices as sounding more like the person he spoke to.
	
	
	Detective Callanan, one of the investigating officers, telephoned the person who had identified himself as Mr Fisher to Mr Gao on the mobile number that Mr Gao gave him. The person who answered the call only spoke two to three words. Detective Callanan described that person as having a “very deep voice”.
	


Consideration


	
	As is apparent from the evidence of these witnesses, apart from Ms Innes, they made their identification of the appellant’s voice without either noticing or being distracted by a clicking noise or background noise on the recording. The appellant also acknowledged that none of the witnesses were asked whether the reason they chose the recording of the appellant’s voice was because of the background noise or the clicking sound where the tape had been spliced. He also acknowledged that none of the witnesses had withdrawn their evidence having had those matters pointed out to them in the course of their cross-examination and having listened to the recordings in court.
	
	
	The appellant also acknowledged that the “concession” made by Ms Candido that it was possible that she was mistaken and by Ms Pireh that she could not be 100 per cent sure were matters of weight to be assessed by the jury having regard to the whole of the evidence. This aspect of his argument may thus be put to one side as it does not impinge upon any question of admissibility under s 137 or any other question of unfairness.
	
	
	There was nothing in the evidence of Mr Mircevski, Ms Candido or Ms Pireh that could be described as ‘frail’ or ‘fragile’. To the contrary, their evidence supported the Crown case in a straightforward and compelling way, notwithstanding the ‘concession’ of both Ms Candido and Ms Pireh which the jury was required to weigh with the other evidence. However, taken in conjunction with all of the evidence, those concessions did not undermine the strength of the Crown case. Nor, in our opinion, was there anything in their evidence that could be misused by the jury, such as to give rise to unfair prejudice in the sense required for the purposes of s 137.
	
	
	Having watched and listened to the videos of the voice identification process, and apart from the differences in the voices themselves and the manner of the individual delivery of each participant, the only discernible difference was that in the recording of the appellant’s voice, as the Court had been told, there were two clicks where the tape had apparently been spliced together. On those recordings, there were no apparent differences discernible in relation to background noise or the distance of the speaker from the microphone.
	
	
	To the extent there may have been “tinniness” and some background noise when the recordings were played in the trial, from our observation of the video recording of the voice identification process, that did not seem to have influenced the witnesses during the voice identification process. Nor, on the observations of each of the members of this Court, were witnesses distracted by the clicking noise in the recording of the appellant’s voice. Further, the difference in sound quality between the appellant’s sample and the comparators were matters squarely raised in cross-examination which the jury were entitled to take into account. There was no obligation on the Crown to call expert evidence in relation to it. There was, therefore, no unfair prejudice by reason of the sound quality, and it follows that it was not unfair that it was only in the Crown’s closing address that the jury were told explicitly that the recording was constructed from three separate sections.
	
	
	The periods of time that elapsed from when the witnesses heard the appellant’s voice and when they participated in the voice identification procedure were also explicitly raised during the cross-examination of a number of the voice identification witnesses and some witnesses also raised it during the course of the voice identification process. The jury were aware of the dates of the relevant events for all of the witnesses. The effect of the lapse in time was a matter for the jury to take into account to give those matters such weight as they considered appropriate. No unfair prejudice arose from it.
	
	
	Similarly, the failure of the police to clarify certain matters with the voice identification witnesses did not give rise to any unfairness in circumstances where the appellant had an opportunity to raise that matter in cross-examination.
	
	
	The fact that some witnesses did not identify the appellant’s voice did not raise any unfair prejudice. That too was a matter for the jury to assess so as to be satisfied whether, on the whole of the evidence, including that of the other voice identification witnesses, the personal identification evidence and the handwriting evidence, they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. The same may be said for the short duration of the sample voices.
	
	
	We would dismiss grounds 2 and 3 of the amended notice of appeal.
	


Ground 4: the photo identification evidence


	
	The photo identification evidence consisted of witness statements made on the basis of still images taken from the CCTV footage from the Airport Hotel Inn.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the photo evidence was not relevant, as it did not connect him “to any action” and all it did was show a person “going through the foyer”. The appellant submitted that in circumstances where the photographs were in evidence and the appellant was in court, it was a matter for the jury to make their own identification.
	
	
	The appellant also contended that the photographs should have been ruled inadmissible pursuant to s 137 because although they had probative value, that was outweighed by the danger of prejudice to him. He said that the prejudice was that the photographs were of “such poor quality” that it was not possible to sufficiently identify the characteristics of any person in the photographs and there was, therefore, no basis for the identification of him in them. He further contended that the evidence relating to the appellant’s weight loss “seed[ed] the jury with the concept that it’s the weight loss and that’s [the appellant] because of that reason”.
	
	
	These submissions were not an accurate reflection of the evidence. Each of the six witnesses called on this issue had known the appellant in January 2006 and gave evidence that in their opinion the person in the photographs was the appellant. They also gave evidence that the appellant had lost significant weight since that time. This was not a case where the photographic evidence before the jury was such that they were in as good a position to determine whether the person in the photograph was the person in the photograph. Rather, each of the witnesses was in a better position than the jury to recognise the appellant because his appearance at the time of trial differed in a significant way from his appearance at the time of the offence. They were able to identify the person in the photograph as the appellant at the time that the offences were committed. It followed that the witness statements were relevant: R v Smith [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at [13]-[15]. The photo evidence itself was relevant as, if accepted, it placed the appellant in the vicinity of a computer on which part of the fraud was committed at the relevant time. The probative value of all the evidence was substantial and outweighed any prejudice caused by the poor quality of the photographs, which in any case was brought up in the trial and went primarily to the question of the weight to be given to the evidence by the jury.
	
	
	The appellant also objected to the admissibility of the CCTV footage, that objection flowing from his objection to the admissibility of the still images. No independent argument was advanced. For the same reasons as given in respect of the still images, the appellant’s objection to the CCTV footage should be rejected.
	
	
	It follows from what we have said that we would reject ground 4 of the amended grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 5: failure to discharge the jury


	
	Ground 5 of the appeal was in the following terms:
	


“A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of her Honour failing to discharge the jury in circumstances in which [the] Crown tendered a document, Exhibit BA and the appellant had inadvertently failed to object to, that made clear reference to material suggesting there was a link between prior convictions of fraud and the appellant.”


	
	An application was made to discharge the jury on the fourteenth day of the trial in circumstances where the Crown had tendered a five page document, marked as Exh BA. That document, which had been prepared by Mr Westwood for use by the jury, comprised a schedule of sample material, that is, various words and phrases taken from the specimen documents. It was prepared for the purposes of comparison with both the specimen documents and those documents alleged to have been prepared by the appellant as part of the fraudulent activity subject of the charges and an explanation of any variations in letter format between those documents.
	
	
	No objection was taken to the admissibility of the document when it was placed before the jury. Mr Westwood then commenced his evidence, which he gave by reference to Exh BA. Mr Westwood referred to the letter “s” in the word “sheriff” and to the “s” in the words “my counsel, solicitor and myself”, as compared to the “s” as written in the word “Australia”, which the witness observed varied from one another. Reference was then made to other words. Insofar as any contained a legal reference, Mr Westwood referred to a number of words which were alleged to relate to legal proceedings or fraud, including, “witnesses”; “Dasios”; “sheriff’s”, “my counsel, solicitor and myself”, “Michael Carol” (the appellant’s solicitor); “passport”; “property”; and “police station”.
	
	
	During the course of Mr Westwood’s evidence, the appellant’s counsel signalled there was an urgent problem and the jury was asked to leave the court and to leave their documents in the courtroom. The Crown withdrew the tender of Exh BA, at which time the appellant made an application for the discharge of the jury.
	
	
	The trial judge refused the application. In her judgment published on 4 September 2012, her Honour considered each of the words said to be prejudicial and explained why, either in isolation or in combination with other words there was no prejudice to the appellant. The judgment speaks for itself and it is not necessary to re-iterate here her Honour’s consideration of each word or phrase about which complaint was made. It is appropriate, however, and sufficient, to refer to her consideration of those words or phrases, such as “fraud related charges” which appeared on Exh BA said to be particularly prejudicial.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the phrase “fraud related charges” would suggest to the jury that the appellant had convictions for fraud or had other fraud related charges pending. The same submission had been made before the trial judge. The trial judge, at 9 of her judgment, observed that there was no reason why the jury would reach such a conclusion in circumstances where the reference was to the very charge the subject of the proceedings. Her Honour considered that there was no reason for it to have even occurred to the jury that the accused might have faced or be facing other fraud related charges. Her Honour noted that this submission would have had more weight if there had been a reference to another charge such as the charge of murder.
	
	
	Exh BA contained a reference to the names “Angelo Bilias” and “Gregory J Goold”. These are names of solicitors. Her Honour doubted that the jury would recognise the names at all or that they would know they were the names of persons well known in the criminal law. Her Honour stated that she, herself, had never heard of the former. Her Honour continued:
	


“… the very fact that [the appellant] has been charged with such fraud is a matter that a jury might reasonably expect to cause him to thereafter address correspondence to solicitors specialised in criminal law, or that he might refer to matters such as ‘affidavit’ and ‘conviction’ and ‘witnesses’ and ‘police’, ‘superintendent’ and ‘police station’ without any implication that he had been convicted of an offence.”


	
	There was also a reference to a person by the name of “Mr Dasios” in a phrase in the document, “Mr Dasios and other Crown witnesses to be contrived”. Mr Dasios was not, and was not intended to be, a witness at the trial. Her Honour dealt with this reference at 10 of her judgment, as follows:
	


“… it is highly unlikely that any jury in the time they had the document before them would have cross referenced such mention to the list of witnesses before them, or that they would otherwise remember the name, or if they noticed he wasn’t called by the end of the trial, that they would conclude that he must have been a witness in some other proceedings.”


	
	Her Honour, at 10, was also of the opinion that the phrases “litigation”, “Crown witnesses”, “court”, “cross-examination”, “David McGovern QC”, “counsel” and “solicitor”, whilst suggestive of court proceedings, did not thereby suggest that the accused had been convicted of a criminal offence.
	
	
	Two words which were also the subject of debate were the abbreviations or acronyms “MIN” and “VIN”. These were not the subject of evidence by Mr Westwood before Exh BA was removed from the jury’s possession. Her Honour’s ruling was made against the possibility that the jury had observed or taken note of the words. Her Honour, at 9 of her judgment, considered that it was unlikely the jury would know what the abbreviation MIN was a reference to. We agree. Her Honour also considered that if the jury attached any meaning to VIN, had they taken notice of it, they would have believed it meant “vehicle identification number”. However, her Honour observed that even if a jury member recognised it as meaning “visitor identity number”, such as to conclude that the appellant was being held in gaol, bail refused, that would have been a reasonable expectation in the case where the accused was charged with a $15 million fraud.
	
	
	When the jury returned, the trial judge told the jury that that Exh BA had been withdrawn so that it could be “put in a more convenient form”.
	


Principles relating to the discharge of the jury


	
	The principles relating to an application for the discharge of the jury and appellate review thereof were reviewed by this Court in Khazaal v R [2010] NSWCC 129 per Hall J at [265] ff. The following principles emerge from his Honour’s review and from the two leading cases he cites Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427 and Maric v R (1978) 52 ALJR 631:
	



	
	In determining whether the jury must be discharged following the wrongful admission of evidence, there is no rigid rule to be applied: Crofts at 440.
	
	
	In deciding an application to discharge the jury, key considerations include:
	



	
	the fairness of the trial: Crofts at 440;
	
	
	the nature of the statements said to have given rise to the prejudice, including whether they were such as to “have been left vividly etched on the mind of the jury”: Crofts at 441;
	
	
	the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues: Crofts at 440;
	
	
	the stage at which the mishap occurs: Crofts at 440; Maric at 635;
	
	
	the deliberateness of the wrongful conduct: Crofts at 440; Maric at 635;
	
	
	the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome the apprehended impact of the evidence, and particularly the difficulty of formulating a direction that does not refer specifically to the evidence and by doing so reinforce the prejudice: Crofts at 440-441; Maric at 635.
	



	
	Such damage as was caused by the wrongly admitted evidence may not be capable of remedy by trial directions: Maric at 635.
	
	
	The test to be applied by appellate courts reviewing the discretion to discharge has been stated in a variety of ways. However, in Maric, at 635, it was noted that “[a]t basis, the question is whether [the court] can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict”, and in Crofts, at 441, the question was put similarly as whether, in the circumstances, the appellate court can “say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable”.
	
	
	Significant leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations, bearing in mind:
	


“… that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript”: Crofts at 440-441.


	
	Nevertheless, the duty of an appellate court considering a challenge to the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge “is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind”: Crofts at 441, but rather must apply the broader test stated at (4) above.
	


Consideration


	
	There was no error in her Honour’s observations or in her approach to this matter. As her Honour correctly pointed out, the appellant’s trial was in respect of fraud related matters and there was nothing to suggest that the jury would have thought that these words were a reference to some other matter. The other references said to be prejudicial, as her Honour pointed out, would have been readily understood by the jury, if they gave any thought to them other than as words on a page, as a reference to the various charges before the court.
	
	
	Further, as is apparent from the number of pages over which Mr Westwood gave evidence by reference to Exh BA, the document was before the jury for a number of minutes only. The problem arose on 9 August 2012, the fourteenth day of the trial. In addition, the trial continued until 14 January 2013 when the jury retired to consider its verdict. The jury returned its verdicts on 17 January 2013.
	
	
	This is a case where the appellate court can be confident that the irregularity in Exh BA being before the jury, in the circumstances to which we have referred, did not affect the verdict. Accordingly, we dismiss ground 5 of the amended notice of appeal.
	


Ground 6: the handwriting evidence


	
	Paul Westwood, a handwriting expert called by the Crown, gave evidence that the handwriting on certain documents (the specimen documents) was the same as the handwriting on the Certificate of Title, and on documents Exh Q (relating to count 16), Exh R (relating to count 17) and Exh AA. As referred to above, the Certificate of Title was rejected by the Registrar-General on the basis that it was forged.
	
	
	Exh Q was a direct debit request dated “9/1/06” to debit the account of the Company to pay the Uniting Church (NSW) Trust Association. The document was purported to be signed by “Mr Linz” and “Mr Bassarabie”. Both those persons gave evidence and said they did not sign the document.
	
	
	Exhibit R was an “Identification Record for a Signatory to an Account” purported to be signed by “Mr Linz”. Mr Linz gave evidence that he did not sign the document. He acknowledged that the date of birth on the document was his date of birth, that he was unsure whether the passport number was correct and that he did not know anybody by the name of “Peter Michael Davis”, being a name nominated on the document as an “acceptable referee”. That part of the form stated that the person was a solicitor and that his address was Bridge Street, Sydney. There was no record of a Peter Michael Davis on the official records of the Law Society of New South Wales. Mr Linz had no knowledge of the address in Bridge Street, Sydney.
	
	
	Exhibit AA was an envelope addressed to Roger Cornforth, Holman Webb Lawyers Level 17, 123 Pitt Street Sydney NSW 2000. The address was handwritten in block capital letters. Mr Cornforth was the solicitor for the Uniting Church (NSW) Trust Association.
	
	
	There were 10 specimen documents:
	



	
	A correctional centre intake form containing the records of the appellant including a photograph, and “Emergency Contact Details” naming the appellant’s wife and daughter as contacts. The document was signed by Chad Hodges, who witnessed the appellant’s signature;
	
	
	A bail reporting sheet purportedly repeatedly signed by the appellant and signed by a large number of persons as witnesses;
	
	
	An application for bail purportedly filled out by the appellant;
	
	
	An envelope obtained in the execution of a search warrant at the house of the appellant’s ex-wife and his daughter, addressed to the appellant’s daughter and with the appellant’s name and then address written on the back. This envelope contained a list of names;
	
	
	An envelope from the same source and with the same characteristics as specimen document 4, containing draft affidavits relating to legal matters concerning the appellant;
	
	
	An envelope from the same source and with the same characteristics as specimen document 4, containing a handwritten letter, apparently in the nature of a complaint to the Attorney-General and purportedly signed by the appellant;
	
	
	An envelope obtained in the execution of a search warrant at Parklea Correctional Centre. The sender is nominated as the appellant and the addressee was his father. The envelope contained a letter signed in the name “Damon”, and a further note requesting that the appellant’s father deliver the letter in a new envelope to “Nitta at Wybenia Nursing Home”;
	
	
	A membership application, purportedly signed by the appellant and listing his name, his then address, his date of birth, and his phone number;
	
	
	A Guardian Mortgages Pty Limited mortgage application form filled out in the name “David Miller”;
	
	
	A photocopy of a draft affidavit relating to legal matters concerning the appellant found in the appellant’s cell during a cell search on 18 October 2007.
	



	
	In the absence of any admission or concession by the appellant that the specimen documents were his handwriting, the Crown adduced the following evidence to prove that the specimen documents contained his handwriting. In relation to specimen document 1, Mr Hodges gave evidence that he had seen the appellant complete the form in his presence. There was also circumstantial evidence from Detective Schussler that police inquiries had revealed that the emergency contact numbers listed were those of the appellant’s ex-wife and daughter.
	
	
	Twenty-two persons gave evidence that the appellant had signed specimen document 2 in their presence, and Detective Schussler gave evidence he could have secured the attendance of approximately a further 10 witnesses.
	
	
	The evidence supporting the Crown’s contentions relating to the other specimen documents was circumstantial. The contents of the forms comprising specimen documents 1-3 and 8 relate solely to the appellant and they appeared to be signed by him. The appellant’s name and return address on the envelopes comprising specimen documents 4-7 raise the inference that it was he who wrote them. The recipients of specimen documents 4-7 were members of the appellant’s family, and Ms Natnitta Hudson, the apparent recipient of the letter contained in specimen document 7, gave evidence that she knew the appellant. The places where specimen documents 4-7 and 10 were found, about which evidence was led, link them to the appellant. The affidavits and the letter of complaint in specimen documents 5, 6 and 10 relate to legal matters personal to the appellant. In relation to these matters, a summary of other litigation concerning the appellant was adduced.
	
	
	Mr Benn, executive director of Guardian Mortgages, gave evidence that he had spoken on the phone to a person named “David Miller” and that he received specimen document 9 accompanied by a PAYG certificate and certified copies of a passport and driver’s licence in that name. The mortgage relating to specimen document 9 was the subject of proceedings brought by Guardian Mortgages against “David Miller”, which were described in the summary of other litigation.
	
	
	Evidence from a number of sources raised the inference that the appellant had used the name “David Miller”. Detective Heatherington gave evidence that he obtained from the appellant a passport and driver licence in the name “David Miller”. Certificates from the RTA to the effect that the driver’s licence number related to a female with a different date of birth and that the RTA held no records of a “David Miller” with the listed date of birth. In addition, Richard Lynch gave evidence that a man he identified from a photograph as the appellant had spoken to him about property refinancing, by phone and in person, using the name “David Miller”.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Westwood gave evidence that in his opinion, apart from certain writings obviously placed on some of the documents by others, it was reasonable to conclude that one person wrote the handwriting on all the documents.
	
	
	The specimen documents were admitted, over objection, in edited form. The nature of specimen document 1, relating to correctional facilities, and documents 2 and 3, relating to bail, was not disclosed to the jury. Elements of the affidavits forming part of specimen documents 5 and 10 and the complaint forming part of specimen document 6 relating to proceedings involving the appellant were redacted. Further, circumstantial evidence relating to the specimen documents was led in such a way as to avoid disclosing the appellant’s past custodial sentences, such that, for instance, Edward Kennedy-Davidson gave evidence that he was working at a “residence” when he obtained specimen document 10 from the room occupied by “David Miller”.
	


Appellant’s challenge to admissibility


	
	By ground 6 of his notice of appeal, the appellant contended that the court erred in admitting the evidence of Mr Westwood in relation to identification of handwriting.
	
	
	The appellant complained that the specimen documents themselves and the circumstantial evidence as to how they were brought into existence had significant prejudicial effect and that the content of the specimen documents was irrelevant. This challenge was based on the Evidence Act, ss 55 and 137.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that the documents used as part of the commission of the offences were sometimes pictorial and had a different structure from the specimen documents so as to make any comparison between the two sets of documents inappropriate. He contended that the use of transparencies and magnification were prejudicial and that the methodology used by the handwriting expert, Mr Westwood, and that his comparisons and opinions were extremely unreliable. Further, he relied upon the concession by Mr Westwood that if the author of the documents had attempted to disguise his handwriting, it would render any comparisons and opinions extremely unreliable.
	
	
	In his oral argument on the appeal, the appellant’s sole contention was that Mr Westwood’s opinion evidence should not have been admitted because only specimen documents 1 and 2 were verified as being the handwriting of the appellant. The appellant confirmed, on questioning by the Court, that his submission in respect of ground 6 was that the evidence of a handwriting expert must never be tendered in a trial unless and until there was evidence that each of the documents used for comparison purposes can be independently shown to be the evidence of the person whose handwriting is under analysis.
	


Consideration


	
	The appellant has cast his submission in respect of ground 6 too high. It cannot be the case that every document must be independently verified as being the handwriting of an accused person before opinion evidence may be given by an expert concerning the characteristics of the handwriting, or whether particular documents were written by the same person. Circumstantial evidence that a particular specimen document was written by the accused person is sufficient for the purposes of admissibility. It is then a matter of weight for the jury to determine whether they are satisfied that some or all of the specimen documents contain handwriting of the accused person.
	
	
	Having regard to that aspect of the determination, it is then for the jury to undertake the comparison exercise between such of the specimen documents as they are satisfied contain the handwriting of the accused person and the documents which, relevantly in this case, are contended by the Crown to be documents written by him as part of the commission of the offences. The jury was entitled to give such weight as they saw fit to the opinion evidence of Mr Westwood.
	
	
	There was circumstantial evidence in support of each of the contested specimen documents. As the review above indicates, the nature and extent of that evidence varied. It was a matter for the jury to determine whether to accept any particular specimen document for the purposes of comparison.
	
	
	Ground 6 of the amended notice of appeal is rejected.
	


The “unsafe and/or dangerous grounds”


	
	By grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal, the appellant contended that the “verdict was unsafe and/or dangerous”. Ground 2 was directed to the voice identification evidence.
	
	
	The Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1), provides, relevantly, that an appeal against conviction is to be allowed if the court is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 6(1), the Court is required to determine whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58] per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ; SKA v The Queen [2001] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [12] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ. In M, at 494, their Honours noted that:
	


“The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand.” (citations omitted)

See also SKA at [14].


	
	For the purposes of s 6(1), the starting point is that the jury, having seen and heard the witnesses, has the primary function of determining the guilt or innocence of the accused: M at 493; MFA at [51]. However, as was stated in M by the majority, at 494:
	


“In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.”

See also SKA at [13].


	
	There were considerable difficulties with the manner in which these grounds were sought to be argued, if in fact they were argued. As indicated earlier in these reasons, the appellant did not clearly identify a challenge to the verdicts on the basis that they were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Indeed, ground 1 was framed in global terms without reference to any of the 21 counts on the indictment. In oral argument, the appellant made two references to M and a single reference to ground 1. He made one reference to this ground in relation to the voice identification evidence, but did not develop any argument on that basis.
	
	
	In relation to the former, the appellant submitted, in dealing with the voice identification evidence and his contention that it should not have been admitted pursuant to s 137, the case “also falls under M … this Court should actually assess the … evidence, and if there is a doubt experienced by this Court, it is a doubt that the jury should have also had”. 
	
	
	The appellant made a further reference to M. That reference, in the context of the submission then being made was as follows:
	


“[COUNSEL]: My submission is based on that sample, which consequently results in the witnesses giving their evidence identifying the appellant is that it is that witness - the frailty and fragileness of that evidence should have been excluded and if it wasn't excluded --

BEAZLEY P: Excluded on what basis?

[COUNSEL]: Initially an application should have been brought on for s 137 and if not that, it should be excluded on the basis that it brings no probative value to the matter. And then I suppose it is, as I mentioned under …

…

[COUNSEL]: M v The Queen 1994.

HAMILL J: By reasonable verdicts.

[COUNSEL]: Correct.

HAMILL J: But in assessing the reasonableness of the verdict, you don't take a particular piece of evidence or a particular part of the evidence in isolation, do you?

[COUNSEL]: No, we don't. It is not to be looked at piecemeal but as a combination of a number of pieces of evidence. And it is then to move to what I would suggest is that my submission in regards to the video evidence or the photo identification, as to why that photo identification is evidence that should not have been taken. It is again fragile evidence and the witness identification was nothing more than what was already available to the jury.”


	
	The appellant’s argument then moved to the admissibility of the video evidence, which he accepted was relevant but submitted should have been rejected under s 137. There was no further reference to M. However, in dealing with the document that was withdrawn from the jury and its replacement with Exh BH, the following exchange took place:
	


“BEAZLEY P: Would you just tell me what ground of appeal you are now working on, please?

[COUNSEL]: It is essentially the ground 1 of the appeal, which is the verdict was unsafe and dangerous in all the circumstances of the proceedings.

I have overnight made an amended document which I am happy to hand up, which just points to this point that I am talking about.

…

BEAZLEY P: So it’s a new ground?

[COUNSEL]: It is a new ground.”


	
	The appellant’s counsel then filed in court the amended notice of appeal which included the new ground 5 in relation to the discharge of the jury. That ground was argued with no further reference to ground 1 or M, and no further submission was directed to the verdicts being unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.
	
	
	Part of the problem in identifying the appellant’s complaint arose from the lack of precision in the drafting of grounds 1 and 2. Since the decision in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 the use of the phrase “unsafe and unsatisfactory” has lost its currency. In that case, the Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ) said:
	


“The fundamental point is that close attention must be paid to the language of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Use of the potentially confusing phrase ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ to cover the several different elements in the sub-section is liable to mislead. There is no substitute for giving attention to the precise terms in which s 6(1) is expressed.”


	
	The expression “unsafe and/or dangerous” (used in both grounds 1 and 2) is even more confusing, is liable to mislead and, in this appeal, made it difficult to determine precisely what arguments the appellant sought to make.
	
	
	This is an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs. In a trial which occurred over approximately 96 days with 5,000 pages of transcript and 120 exhibits, the Court is entitled to much greater assistance than it received in this case. However, it was apparent that the thrust of the appellant’s argument was that the voice identification evidence was of no probative value and that taken with the photo identification evidence and the evidence of the handwriting expert the verdict was unreasonable. The appellant contended that the voice recognition evidence comprised a substantial portion of the evidence at trial and that taken with the visual and handwriting recognition evidence, the sheer volume of the evidence must have had an impact on the jury.
	
	
	On the assumption that an “unsafe” ground was pressed, we consider that in the highly unusual circumstances of this case, having regard to the way in which the appeal was argued, this ground is appropriately and fully considered by reference to the evidence in respect of these three matters. We are further satisfied that it is appropriate to do so as this evidence was the central evidence upon which the Crown case was based.
	
	
	We have read the evidence relating to these aspects of the Crown case, not limited to those pages of transcript that the appellant identified as being relevant to his grounds of appeal. The voice identification evidence was strong evidence implicating the appellant as the maker of the various telephone calls that were part of the conduct subject of the charges. This is so notwithstanding that three witnesses could not identify, or wrongly identified, a voice as that of the appellant and some witnesses were less sure than others as to whether the voice they identified was that of the person who had telephoned them.
	
	
	The video and photographic evidence in conjunction with the evidence of the witnesses identifying the appellant as the person entering the Airport Inn Hotel was also strong, if not overwhelming evidence that the appellant was at the hotel at the time that an email was sent from the hotel’s email account to Mr Gao.
	
	
	The handwriting evidence also strongly supported the Crown case that the appellant’s handwriting was on the documents used for the purposes of the fraud.
	
	
	In our opinion, on the whole of the evidence relating to the three aspects of the evidence discussed in these reasons, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. Indeed, we consider this was a very strong case.
	
	
	It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	


Grounds 7 and 8: the challenges to sentence


	
	Woodburne DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence in relation to the 21 convictions pursuant to the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. No complaint was made in relation to her Honour’s approach in setting the aggregate sentence and her Honour’s remarks show strict adherence to the provisions of the Act.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal relating to sentence were in the following terms:
	


“(7)   In all the circumstances, the non-parole period was manifestly excessive and severe.

(8)   In the determination of the aggregate sentence and non-parole period excessive weight was placed upon the principle of specific deterrence in all the circumstances.”


	
	The sentence actually imposed was an aggregate term of 10 years with an aggregate non-parole period of six years. Her Honour indicated notional sentences, in relation to count 1, of 4 years and 9 months, and in relation to counts 2 to 21, of between 3 years (count 5) and 4 years 9 months (count 19).
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge was dealing with an offender who had twice previously been sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment for offences of a similar kind. In 2007, the appellant was convicted of obtaining an amount of money greater than $15,000 by deception and four counts of using a false instrument. In respect of each of those convictions he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, with the sentences partially accumulated. In 2009, the appellant was convicted of three counts of making a false instrument to obtain an amount of money greater than $15,000 and one count of each of using a false instrument, and obtaining an amount of money greater than $15,000 by deception. In respect of those convictions the appellant received sentences of 3 years and 4 years 6 months, partially accumulated, with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In view of that history, personal (or specific) deterrence had a significant role to play. Nothing in the appellant’s written or oral submissions addressed the assertion in ground 8 that that too much weight was given to personal deterrence. There is nothing in her Honour’s remarks on sentence to support the proposition that excessive weight was placed on that matter. The question of what “weight” is to be given to particular considerations and facts is a matter for the sentencing judge. Ground 8 is without substance.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that her Honour was in error in determining the commencement dates of the sentence and in failing to take into account the delays in bringing the case to trial. However, a consideration of the remarks on sentence shows that her Honour gave careful consideration to the appropriate commencement date and was acutely aware of the options available to her. Her Honour concluded that to take into account pre-sentence custody in circumstances where the appellant was serving a sentence for other unrelated, albeit very similar, crimes would result in what she described as a “wholly inadequate approach”. That was an approach that was open to her Honour.
	
	
	Her Honour gave careful consideration to the delay, noting that the reasons for the delay had not been established by evidence and that she did not accept the submissions that had apparently been made to her that the appellant had rehabilitated himself during the period leading up to his current trial. In view of the appellant’s stance at trial, that he was not involved in the fraudulent scheme, that finding was hardly surprising.
	
	
	Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances justifying an adjustment of the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period based on the accumulation of the aggregate sentence that she was to impose upon the sentences with those which the appellant was then serving. Her Honour noted that the effect of the totality of the sentencing would be that the appellant would serve 75 per cent of the total sentence in custody and that this was her intention. No error has been shown in that approach and no arguments have been addressed to it.
	
	
	Paragraph 81 of the written submissions asserted that the sentencing judge:
	


“… failed to take into account the special circumstance under section 44(2) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) that applied to the appellant. The special circumstance being the fact that [named police officers] were found to be withholding crucial evidence of voice recognition that was discovered after summing up by Judge Tupman in the prior trial matter. This resulted in the jury being unable to reach a verdict and a retrial.”


	
	This submission is misconceived. It was not further advanced or articulated in oral argument and was not a matter (assuming it was proved or accepted) which would ordinarily be considered as a special circumstance pursuant to s 44 or something that would impact on the appropriate proportion of the sentence to be served in custody.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive by reference to comparable cases. This Court was not referred to any comparable cases. Similarly, the trial judge noted that she had not been referred any comparable cases, “perhaps because of the nature of this particular fraud”. This submission may be rejected.
	
	
	No error has been identified in her Honour’s careful and thorough remarks on sentence. The crime was a particularly serious example of fraudulent conduct. In view of the sophisticated nature of the crime, the long period over which it occurred, and the amount of money obtained by deception, the sentence imposed is an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion. Ground 7 should also be rejected and the application for leave to appeal against the sentence should be refused.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	


(1)   Application for leave to appeal against sentence refused;

(2)   Appeal against conviction dismissed.

		03 August 2015",2015-08-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702997,El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2015] NSWCCA 196,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Simpson JA.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: Between June and August 2006 the applicants (Naseam El-Zeyat, Ramzi Aouad and Abbas Osman) were jointly tried before Bell J (when her Honour was a member of the Supreme Court) on an indictment that charged each of them (and another man, Adnan Darwiche) with the murders, on 14 October 2003, of Ziad Razzak and Mervat (also known as Melissa) Nemra. Darwiche was also charged with other offences. On 9 August 2006 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each count against each applicant, and on two of the further counts against Darwiche.
	
	
	At an earlier trial, also before Bell J, El-Zeyat and Aouad had been convicted of another murder, of Ahmed Fahda, on 30 October 2003, that is, just over two weeks after the murder of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra.
	
	
	By s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), conviction for an offence of murder carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) a standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed. Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to which it will be necessary to make later reference, purports to prescribe certain circumstances in which a sentence of life imprisonment is mandated for offences of murder.
	
	
	On 10 November 2006, Bell J sentenced the applicants. With respect to each count of murder (including the murder of Mr Fahda), her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for life on El-Zeyat and Aouad. On each of the two counts of murder of which he was convicted she sentenced Osman to imprisonment for 27 years, with a non-parole period of 22 years. She ordered that the second sentence commence 3 years after the first. The accumulation resulted in an overall sentence of imprisonment for 30 years, with a non-parole period of 25 years. Her Honour ordered that the first sentence commence on 11 October 2006, at the expiration of the non-parole period of sentences he was serving in respect of unrelated convictions.
	
	
	All accused (including Darwiche) appealed against the convictions. They did not then seek leave to appeal against the sentences (or in the case of Aouad, pursue a previously filed notice of intention to do so). On 8 April 2011, this Court dismissed all appeals against conviction in respect of the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra: Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424. In a separate judgment, delivered on the same day, the Court allowed the appeals of El-Zeyat and Aouad against their convictions for the murder of Mr Fahda, and ordered that a new trial take place: Aouad v R; El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61; 207 A Crim R 411. The sentences were, by necessary implication, quashed. On 1 June 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) directed that no further proceedings take place on the indictment the subject of those convictions. Accordingly, El-Zeyat and Aouad are to be treated as not guilty of the murder of Mr Fahda.
	
	
	The applicants El-Zeyat, Aouad and Osman now seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon them. In order to do so, having regard to the time that has elapsed since sentencing, each seeks an extension of the time prescribed by the Criminal Appeal Rules. Each has filed affidavit evidence in an attempt to explain the lengthy delay in seeking leave to appeal.
	
	
	Although recognising that there exist powerful arguments in favour of granting an extension of time (the seriousness of the charges, the length of the sentences, and the absence of any prejudice to the Director), the Director stopped short of consenting, pointing to the significant period of time (more than 8 years) since sentencing, and what he contends to be the lack of merit in the grounds advanced on behalf of the applicants. It will therefore be necessary to consider the basis on which each applicant puts his case for extension of time.
	


Extension of time


	
	Rule 3B of the Criminal Appeal Rules specifies a period of 3 months from the date of sentence for an application for leave to appeal to be filed (where no notice of intention to seek such leave has previously been given, as is the present case).
	
	
	Whether an extension of time is to be granted is to be determined by consideration of what the interests of justice in the particular case requires: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601.
	
	
	The applicants were sentenced on 10 November 2006. On 29 November 2006, on behalf of Aouad, a notice of intention to appeal was filed. The notice specified Aouad’s intention of appealing against conviction, and of seeking leave to appeal against sentence. Both El-Zeyat and Osman also appealed against their convictions, although the material before this Court does not disclose whether or not they then sought leave to appeal against their sentences. The judgment of this Court (referred to above, [2011] NSWCCA 62) gives no indication that either El-Zeyat or Osman did seek leave, and suggests that Aouad did not pursue his earlier stated intention. It may be assumed that this was, in each case, because the applicants then (realistically) accepted that, if their conviction appeals failed, their sentences could not be successfully challenged. (In his written submissions on his conviction appeal, however, senior counsel for Aouad expressly reserved the possibility of seeking leave to appeal against sentence in the event (as happened) that any appeal was successful.)
	
	
	On 2 October 2013, Osman filed a notice of application for extension of time to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal, specifying his sentence as the order against which he wished to appeal. On 19 December 2013 Aouad filed a similar notice. On 23 December 2013 El-Zeyat filed a notice to the same effect.
	
	
	Affidavit evidence has been filed on behalf of each applicant explaining the delay - which is of 7 years.
	


El-Zeyat and Aouad


	
	In relation to El-Zeyat and Aouad, it is fair to accept that, while their convictions for the Fahda murder remained current, and until the Director decided not to proceed with the new trial ordered by this Court (early June 2012) it was reasonable for those applicants not to take any action with respect to appealing against their sentences. Notification of the Director’s decision was given to them, at the latest, on 1 June 2012. In my opinion, the interests of justice question must be decided by reference to the period between June 2012 and December 2013, when appropriate initiating action was taken.
	
	
	The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of El-Zeyat set out a history of proceedings, and of various actions taken, during that time. For example, an issue arose concerning documentation of the Director’s decision not to proceed on the Fahda murder charges, which, it seems, was thought to have some possible bearing on an application for leave to appeal. Consideration was also given to other courses of action, such as an application under s 43 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), and an application for an inquiry under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Efforts (that proved fruitless) were also made to locate a transcript of proceedings before Bell J, on the (unlikely) suggestion that her Honour had made some remarks that might have had some bearing upon a challenge to the severity of the sentences.
	
	
	Legal aid was granted on 28 March 2013 (although it is not stated when it was first sought). Eventually, in October 2013, the solicitors received instructions to proceed with an application for leave to appeal against sentence and abandon other avenues.
	
	
	The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of Aouad was to similar effect, although, it seems in his case there was a grant of legal aid for an appeal against the severity of the sentence in June 2012. Just why that was not taken up at the time of the conviction appeal does not appear from the material before this Court.
	
	
	In my opinion, some of the explanation given for the delay in each case is unpersuasive. However, the applicants had little, if any, control over the steps taken on their behalf. As the Director acknowledged, both of these applicants are serving the maximum sentences it is possible to impose. There is no prejudice to the Director in allowing an extension of time in each of these cases. In my opinion, the interests of justice lie in allowing each of these applicants an extension of time to proceed. As will be seen below, I am of the opinion that all proposed grounds of appeal fail, and the appeal must be dismissed. I would, nevertheless, grant leave to appeal. The orders I propose will be set out below.
	


Osman


	
	The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of Osman discloses the following. In 2007 Osman was granted legal aid to appeal against conviction. That grant was cancelled when Legal Aid NSW received advice that the grounds of appeal were unmeritorious. Osman began attempts to fund an appeal privately. Delays occurred when he was advised that all appeals should be heard together. On 8 April 2011 his appeal against conviction was dismissed. However, since an order for retrial of his co-accused in relation to the Fahda murder was made, it was considered that his proposed appeal against sentence could not then proceed.
	
	
	Following the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (referred to below) Legal Aid NSW became engaged in negotiations with the Director’s office in order to find a way forward to deal with the flow on effects of the Muldrock decision.
	
	
	In my opinion, in the case of Osman also, the interests of justice lie in granting an extension of time. His case is more powerful because, as will be seen, I consider that one of his proposed grounds of appeal has substance.
	


The proposed grounds of appeal


	
	It is convenient here to set out the grounds proposed by each applicant.
	


El-Zeyat

“Ground 1: The sentences imposed on the applicant were unduly harsh and severe in [that] the offences did not fall within the ‘worst category’.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in wrongly taking into account the circumstances surrounding the Fadha [sic] murder and the sentence imposed for that murder.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in failing to distinguish the criminality of the applicant from his co-offenders.

Ground 4: The sentencing judge failed to make any, or any sufficient, allowance for the applicant’s youth.

Ground 5: The sentencing judge failed to give full and proper consideration to and apply the criteria under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.”

Aouad

“1. The Court’s decision pursuant to s 61(1) that life sentences be imposed for the murders of Ziad Razzak and Mervat Nemra is now in error, as the conviction for the murder of Ahmed Fahda contributed to that decision and that conviction has subsequently been quashed.

2. The two life sentence [sic] for the murder of Ziad Razzak and Mervat Nemra are manifestly excessive.”

Osman

“1. The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find that the Applicant’s classification as an Extreme High Security Inmate entitled him to a discount on an otherwise appropriate sentence.

2. The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to apply the principle of totality with the consequence that the overall sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive.

3. The Sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which she had regard to the standard non-parole period for the offence of murder, placing undue significance on her assessment of the object[ive] seriousness of the offence.

4. The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find ‘special circumstances’.”

The relevant facts


	
	The facts surrounding the offences relevant to sentencing were comprehensively stated by Bell J. No proposed ground of appeal seeks to call in question any of the facts so found. Having regard to the issues raised by the proposed grounds of appeal, it is necessary to set out, at some length, the relevant facts, although it might appear that much of what follows concentrates on Darwiche, who is not party to the present proceedings.
	
	
	The murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra were committed in the context of a feud, that began in late 2000 or early 2001, between Darwiche and younger members of the Razzak family, arising out of their involvement in the supply of illicit drugs. The feud extended to the firing of shots at Darwiche’s car in February 2001, an event that escalated the conflict, with further use of firearms; some attempts were thereafter made to achieve a peaceful resolution. Such peaceful resolution as was achieved was short-lived. In June 2001 Darwiche (with another man) entered a Razzak family unit at Bankstown and shot at one of its members, Bilal Razzak. (This gave rise to a charge, of which Darwiche was convicted, of a discharging a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm.)
	
	
	After a further period of relative peace, the conflict again escalated. In August 2003 Darwiche, again with another man, travelled to a Razzak family home at Condell Park, armed with high powered firearms. One of the men fired 11 rounds from a handgun into a motor vehicle that was parked outside the premises; this was intended to draw members of the Razzak family outside to investigate, and that is what happened. Frank Razzak came from the house onto a veranda. Darwiche and his companion fired 55 rounds of ammunition in the direction of the veranda. Significant damage was done to the house, but it appears that no personal injury was inflicted.
	
	
	There followed further hostilities. Targeted by Darwiche in the hostilities were two members of the Razzak family, Gehad and Ziad. In order to escape Darwiche’s hostile attentions, Gehad and Ziad Razzak went to stay with a friend, Ali Hamka, at Lawford Street, Greenacre. Because fears were held for their safety, Hamka’s partner, Melissa Nemra, and their two children moved out of the premises. On the evening of 13 October 2003, however, Ms Nemra returned to the Lawford Street house to stay for the evening.
	
	
	Darwiche learned that the two Razzak brothers were staying at the Lawford Street address, and determined to kill them. He embarked upon a considerable degree of planning for that purpose. A car was stolen so that it could be used to transport gunmen to and from Lawford Street. For a time, the vehicle was secreted. Darwiche had access to a unit in Punchbowl, in which he stored a variety of weapons, including a rocket launcher, and ammunition. On 13 October, he, with others (including Aouad and Khaled Taleb, but not El-Zeyat or Osman) gathered in the Punchbowl unit, and inspected the cache of firearms and ammunitions. They prepared the guns and ammunition for use, having been cautioned by Darwiche to avoid leaving any material from which DNA evidence might be extracted.
	
	
	That evening, the weapons were taken to the nearby home of El-Zeyat, in readiness for the attack. The stolen vehicle was driven to El-Zeyat’s home and parked in his garage.
	
	
	Darwiche, Taleb, and the three applicants met at El-Zeyat’s home to plan the attack. Darwiche determined that Osman would be the driver; Darwiche, Aouad, and another man, Mohammed, would be the shooters. El-Zeyat insisted that he be a member of the shooting party, and Darwiche assented to this. Darwiche gave detailed instructions as to how the shooting was to be effected. He gave specific instructions which included shooting towards the bottom of the walls of the house, to cover the contingency that the occupants might drop to the floor when the shooting began.
	
	
	At about 3.00am on 14 October Osman drove the men to a location near Lawford Street. All were armed. Ziad Razzak, Ali Hamka and Ms Nemra were in the house, Ms Nemra asleep in the bedroom. Darwiche and his party discharged 100 rounds, of which 55 penetrated the front wall of the house. One bullet struck Ms Nemra in the neck, fatally wounding her. She died within minutes. Mr Hamka sought assistance from emergency services. Ziad Razzak was struck by a number of bullets, one of which penetrated the back of his skull. When ambulances arrived, he was transported to hospital, where he died some hours later. Mr Hamka was uninjured.
	
	
	The stolen vehicle was set alight in a nearby street.
	
	
	Bell J was satisfied that Darwiche was “the moving force in the planning and commission” of all offences of which he was convicted, including the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra.
	
	
	That completes the relevant factual circumstances concerning the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra.
	
	
	It is necessary then to turn to what her Honour found to be the relevant facts concerning the death of Ahmed Fahda, in relation to which El-Zeyat and Aouad were also convicted of murder, and for which they stood for sentence at the same time as they were to be sentenced for the Razzak and Nemra murders. The background to this murder, the Director alleged, lay (at least in part) in another family dispute, this time between Aouad and the Fahda family. Aouad had been married to Mr Fahda’s sister, but the marriage had, by August 2003, broken down. Aouad feared an attack by his wife’s brothers.
	
	
	The Director alleged, and the jury accepted, that the killing of Mr Fahda took place a little after 2.00pm on the afternoon of Thursday, 30 October. Another man (to whom Bell J referred as “Mr Y”) gave Mr Fahda a lift in his four wheel drive vehicle. The vehicle ran out of petrol, and the two men pushed it to a nearby service station. El-Zeyat, who was in telephone contact with “Mr Y”, came to learn of their location. He and Aouad walked to the service station, where Mr Fahda was waiting for the vehicle to be refuelled. Both El-Zeyat and Aouad were wearing hooded tops; they pulled the hoods over their heads. Each was armed with a loaded Glock pistol. They stepped over a low wall at the service station, stood a short distance from Mr Fahda, and discharged the contents of the guns into his body. 29 bullets were fired, at such close range that the majority entered Mr Fahda’s body. He suffered multiple injuries, many of which would have been fatal.
	
	
	Although Bell J recounted the circumstances of the breakdown of the marriage of Aouad and Mr Fahda’s sister, she was unable to determine either his motive, or that of El-Zeyat, for the murder of Mr Fahda. She described the crime as:
	


“… a planned, brazen and merciless assassination that was carried out just 16 days after each offender was involved in the double murder at Lawford Street.”


	
	None of the “facts” alleged or found concerning the killing of Mr Fahda can now be taken to be established fact. It has been necessary to recount the “facts” as they were understood at sentencing because they formed the basis of the sentences imposed , and, it is asserted in the proposed grounds of appeal, were integral to the sentences imposed with respect to the Razzak and Nemra murders.
	


The proceedings on sentence


	
	Unsurprisingly, in view of the three murder convictions, little effort was made to establish any mitigating circumstances in the cases of El-Zeyat and Aouad. They were, respectively, 23 and 22 years of age at the date of the murders. Each had a relatively minor criminal record. El-Zeyat had served a sentence of imprisonment for 8 months, with a non-parole period of 6 months, in respect of an offence of hindering an investigation, in 1999. Aouad was subject to the terms of a good behaviour bond at the time of the offences. Osman was 25 years of age at the time of the murders. He had a criminal history, in respect of which he had served some sentences of imprisonment. He was serving two terms of imprisonment at the time of the trial. There was before her Honour a Pre-Sentence Report, prepared in relation to an earlier offence, which gave some information about his background and personal history.
	
	
	Some material was put before Bell J that indicated that Osman was classified as “an Extreme High Security Inmate”, which her Honour took to indicate that he was subjected to more onerous conditions of custody than would be the case were he to serve his sentence in other parts of the prison. The material before her Honour indicated that the reason for the classification was “the seriousness of the outstanding charges”. Her Honour expressly stated that she did not consider this to be a factor that should mitigate the sentence to be imposed.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	As stated above, the outline of the circumstances of the offences is drawn from the Remarks on Sentence. It is necessary to refer to some additional passages in the Remarks, indicating the reasoning by which her Honour arrived at the sentences she imposed. It is, perhaps, best to allow her Honour speak for herself. I quote from the Remarks, transcribed as follows:
	


“38  The deaths of Ziad Razzak and Melissa Nemra were brought about by Adnan Darwiche’s ruthless determination to assert his authority over the Razzak family. He was entirely indifferent to the loss of other human life in pursuit of his plan. The basis of his hostility to the Razzaks dates back to rivalry over drug dealing but by mid-2003 Adnan Darwiche had abandoned the business that had brought him into competition with the young Razzaks. He professed religious faith. Nonetheless his outlook on life remained that of a petty gang leader who wished to be seen as a person of consequence within the criminal milieu.

39  I have been referred to a number of authorities touching on the application of s 61(1) … Each case must be determined upon an assessment of its own facts. In cases that call for the imposition of a life sentence, the Court has been satisfied that the offence is one characterised by a feature, or features, of very great heinousness. In my opinion the cold-blooded ruthlessness involved in the planning and execution of the Lawford Street murders is extreme and Adnan Darwiche poses an extreme danger to the community. I have concluded that Adnan Darwiche’s level of culpability in the commission of the murders of Ziad Razzak and Melissa Nemra is so extreme that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence.

…

57  In the Crown’s submission, each of the killings of which Naseam El Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad stand convicted is one to which s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act applies. No submission to the contrary was put on behalf of either offender. It remains a matter for the Court to determine whether the level of culpability of each of these offenders falls into the category of which the section speaks. Both were young men at the time they carried out these terrible crimes. I consider it probable that each was under the influence of Adnan Darwiche and each had a strong desire to win his approval. To the extent that it is appropriate to have regard to it, I observe that the conduct of each of these young men throughout the two trials was eloquent of their immaturity. These are matters that require that the Crown’s submission be given anxious consideration.

58  It remains that there is nothing to mitigate their crimes and that each murder is one displaying very grave criminality. I have already commented on the ruthlessness of the Lawford Street killings as exhibiting an extreme degree of heinousness. Having carried out these two murders each went on to execute Ahmad [sic – Ahmed] Fahda in circumstances of such callousness as, standing alone, to fall within the terms of s 61(1). Notwithstanding their relative youth, I have determined that the level of culpability of Naseam El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad for the commission of each of these three murders is so extreme that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of the maximum sentence.

…

67  Abass Osman was not one of the gunmen in the Lawford Street double murder. His role in the enterprise was to drive the four gunmen to the scene and away from it. He was recruited on the evening before the killing, some five to six hours before that event. He was a willing recruit. He told an associate, Mr W, of the plan, explaining how it was his role to drop Darwiche and the others off in Roberts Road near Lawford Street. He described them as being the soldiers who were going to run down and get the job done.

68  There was evidence that on the evening of 13 October Abass Osman sought out a man who had been in the Canadian army to get advice about the use of a rocket launcher and that he said to this man, ‘we want to fire it into a house. I just want to know if it goes through a house, fibro house, does it have to hit something hard?’. In the Crown’s submission this discussion serves to highlight Abass Osman’s awareness that deadly force was to be used on the occupants of the Lawford Street premises. Counsel for Abass Osman submitted that I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her client was a party to this conversation. During the trial she put to one of the witnesses that the reference to a rocket launcher was an urban myth.

69  … I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Abass Osman did discuss the possible use of a rocket launcher with a person who was believed to have some military training on the evening preceding the attack on Lawford Street. To my mind not a great deal turns on this issue. The rocket launcher was not used in the attack on Lawford Street. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Abass Osman knew deadly force was to be used in the course of the planned assault. He drove four men armed with two SKS rifles and two pistols to the scene knowing what it was that each man was to do.

…

74  In [defence] counsel’s submission, the culpability of Abass Osman is of a lesser order than the culpability of the gunmen. I accept that is so. Nonetheless, his culpability as a person who was a party to this deadly criminal enterprise remains high. Each murder is aggravated in the respects that I have noted. The offender has expressed no remorse for his involvement in them. I accept that Abass Osman is a loving brother and son but there are no factors that mitigate his offences.

…

76  The Court may discount a sentence to reflect the restrictions placed on prisoners who are housed on protection because the nature of their offence is such as to create a risk to their safety should they be allowed to mix in the general prison population. In this case the material records that the offender has been [so] classified because of the seriousness of the outstanding charges. I infer that the assessment takes into account that he is a member of a group who engaged in an incident of extraordinary gun violence any [sic - and] may present more of a management risk than other prisoners. I am not to know how long he will be assessed as an extreme high-risk prisoner. It may be that this will depend in some degree on his behaviour. I do not consider his classification justifies a reduction in the sentence that is otherwise appropriate.

77  Each of the offences has a standard non-parole period of 20 years for an offence in the mid range of objective seriousness for such offences. The offences committed by Abass Osman are, in my view, above the mid range of objective seriousness.

…” (italics added)


	
	Her Honour went on to impose the sentences outlined above.
	


The contentions of the parties


	
	The grounds of appeal proposed on behalf of both El-Zeyat and Aouad include issues concerning s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to which Bell J referred, and in terms of which she made express findings. Section 61 is relevantly in the following terms:
	


“61  Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1)  A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.

…

(3)  Nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21(1).

…”


	
	I have previously commented on the apparent absence of any real content in s 61(1): see Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142; 233 A Crim R 121 at [27]-[30] (special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia refused: Ngo v The Queen [2014] HCATrans 283). In my opinion, s 61(1) is little (if at all) more than a statement of the obvious. It depends, first, upon an evaluation of “the level of culpability [of the offender] in the commission of the offence”. Where that level of culpability is found to be “so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of [a sentence of imprisonment for life]”, then the sentencing judge is obliged (“is to”) impose that sentence. Even in the absence of s 61(1), a court that arrived at an evaluation of “the level of culpability” of an offender in terms of the balance of the sub-section, would be obliged to impose such a sentence. Section 61(1) is no more than a statutory incantation of what the sentencing judge’s duty would be even in the absence of express provision.
	
	
	Section 61(1) is not the only route to a decision to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life. Indeed, s 61(1) is not a penalty prescribing provision (Ngo at [64]). The penalty for the crime of murder is prescribed by s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). What s 61(1) does (at most) is to identify one set of circumstances in which a sentence of life imprisonment is mandated. That is not necessarily the only set of circumstances in which a sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed, although it is the only one relevant to the present proceedings. It may be accepted that sentences of imprisonment for life are reserved (as are maximum sentences prescribed in respect of other, lesser, offences) for cases in the worst category of their kind.
	
	
	I will return to the specific grounds under which s 61(1) is raised.
	


El-Zeyat

Grounds 1 and 2: were the sentences affected by the conviction for the Fahda murder?


	
	By these grounds, it is asserted on behalf of El-Zeyat that the sentences imposed were “unduly harsh and severe” because the offences did not fall within the “worst category” of offences of murder, and that, in reaching a conclusion that they did, Bell J wrongly took into account the circumstances surrounding El-Zeyat’s conviction for the murder of Mr Fahda. If she had done so, on this argument, that would provide an explanation for what is asserted to be a wrong conclusion.
	
	
	In written submissions, an attempt was made to minimise the seriousness of El-Zeyat’s offences by pointing to certain circumstances that can be found in some offences of murder that were here absent. Twelve such circumstances were identified, of which it will suffice to record a sample. The circumstances included:
	


“a.  no background of abuse or violence”;

“c.  there were no acts that prolonged suffering”;

“d.  they were not associated with any sexual assault or accompanied by acts of sexual gratification”;

“e.  there was no involvement of children”;

“l.  the killings did not occur so as to frustrate the course of justice”

Accordingly, it was argued, the offences did not fall into the worst category of offences of murder.


	
	A somewhat different approach was taken in oral submissions. This approach was to highlight the dominant role played by Darwiche (consistent with the express finding of Bell J) and what was said to be the relatively limited role played by El-Zeyat. It was pointed out that, in the chronicle of events, El-Zeyat is first mentioned at a point where the weapons were taken to his home, and a planning meeting took place. (To that may be added the storing of the stolen vehicle in his garage.)
	
	
	It was further argued that, in assessing the objective gravity of the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra, Bell J took into account also the murder of Mr Fahda. In light of the subsequent abandonment of that charge, and El-Zeyat’s presumed innocence, such an approach must now be seen to have been wrong.
	


Consideration of Grounds 1 and 2


	
	These grounds fail at the outset. They are based upon a false premise. I do not accept that, in assessing the gravity of the two murders presently under consideration, Bell J took into account El-Zeyat’s conviction for the murder of Mr Fahda. There is no indication in the Remarks on Sentence that she did so. It would have been wrong to have done so, since the murder of Mr Fahda post-dated the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra. It would have been legitimate in assessing El-Zeyat’s culpability for the later (Fahda) murder, to have taken into account the earlier murders; the reverse is not the case. It would also have been legitimate in assessing any prospects of rehabilitation, to take into account the commission of all three murders. But the present grounds attack Bell J’s assessment of the objective gravity of the Razzak and Nemra murders. That assessment was not affected by the circumstances of the Fahda murder.
	
	
	Moreover, her Honour made express findings about the “cold-blooded ruthlessness” involved in the killing of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra. Those Remarks were made in the context of sentencing Darwiche. Darwiche had nothing to do with the murder of Mr Fahda. The characterisation of the murders at Lawford Street was apt. The description was of the murders; it was not limited to Darwiche’s role in them, dominant though that was.
	
	
	It is quite clear that her Honour (as she was required to do by Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610) carefully assessed the criminality involved in each of the offences, and came to the conclusion that, individually, they called for sentences of life imprisonment. Her Honour did not wrongly count El-Zeyat’s criminality in the murder of Mr Fahda as relevant to his criminality in the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra. At [58] her Honour expressly described “the Lawford Street murders” as “exhibiting an extreme degree of heinousness”.
	
	
	Further, while it is true that the motivation her Honour ascribed to Darwiche - “ruthless determination to assert his authority over the Razzak family” - does not apply to El-Zeyat, her other remarks concerning the objective gravity of that offence are equally applicable to El-Zeyat (and the other participants). It avails El-Zeyat little that he was not, as was Darwiche, motivated by a quest for personal power. He was prepared to assist the person who was so motivated. Indeed, he insisted that he wanted to be included in the shooting party, and was one of the four gunmen.
	
	
	There is no error demonstrated in the approach taken by her Honour to the assessment of El-Zeyat’s criminality, nor in the conclusions that she reached.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is no merit in Grounds 1 or 2 of El-Zeyat’s proposed appeal.
	


Ground 3: did the sentencing judge fail to distinguish this applicant’s criminality from that of the co-offenders?


	
	By Ground 3 it is asserted that her Honour failed to distinguish El-Zeyat’s criminality from the criminality of his co-offenders.
	
	
	It was submitted that:
	


“Her Honour approached the sentencing of [El-Zeyat] as though he were a member of a gang controlled and beholden to Adnan Darwiche and/or the Darwiche family, part of the feud with the Razzak family and playing a role of vengeance against the Razzak family as a part of a gangland killing”.

and that that approach was incorrect, because El-Zeyat was not part of the Darwiche family or of any “gang” controlled by Darwiche.


	
	It was also submitted that there was no evidence that El-Zeyat bore any malice towards Gehad or Ziad Razzak, or Ms Nemra, or that he was even aware of Ms Nemra’s existence.
	
	
	A further submission was that, unlike Aouad and Osman, El-Zeyat was not shown to have been involved in any of the planning or preparations for the attack.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that Bell J failed to take into account that El-Zeyat’s participation was directed by Darwiche, and that there was otherwise no clear motive for his participation.
	


Consideration of Ground 3


	
	Her Honour was at pains, in the account of the relevant facts, to identify the participation of each of the applicants, as well as that of Darwiche. It is true that the measure of Darwiche’s ruthlessness, his involvement in the preparatory stages of the crimes, and, indeed, his instigation of the crimes, can be seen as rendering his participation at a greater level of blameworthiness. It may also be true that, in contrast with Aouad and Osman, the evidence did not disclose early entry by El-Zeyat into the preparations.
	
	
	Nevertheless, in terms of involvement, there is nothing to distinguish El-Zeyat’s participation from that of Aouad. That they might have performed slightly different acts of participation is not to the point. Both willingly took part in the execution; both were armed and fired shots into the house.
	
	
	It is, to me, a somewhat surprising proposition that a person taking part in a “cold-blooded execution” is somehow less culpable because he is not motivated by personal animus towards the victims, or that he did so at the direction of another, and that he had no apparent motive. It is a proposition I would reject, in whole and as to each of its parts.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no merit in this proposed ground.
	


Ground 4 - El-Zeyat’s relative youth


	
	As noted above, El-Zeyat was 23 years of age at the time of the offences.
	
	
	Senior counsel for El-Zeyat relied upon a passage from R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; 124 A Crim R 451, in which the Court said:
	


“… where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years.”

There are many other statements of principle to similar effect.


	
	The short submission was that El-Zeyat’s participation:
	


“… clearly bespoke lack of forethought, immaturity and impulsiveness - in circumstances where he was directed and led into a crime.”

Attention was drawn to the observation of Bell J that the conduct of El-Zeyat and Aouad during the two trials “was eloquent of their immaturity”.

Consideration of Ground 4


	
	At 23, El-Zeyat barely qualifies as a “youthful offender”. The offender in Hearne was 18 years and 9 months.
	
	
	As was acknowledged in the submissions, Bell J expressly recognised El-Zeyat’s immaturity. The authorities concerning sentencing youthful offenders do not dictate that a sentence be reduced on account of that circumstance. It is a relevant sentencing consideration. The weight (if any) to be accorded to it is a matter for the sentencing judge: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571. In this case, El-Zeyat was 23 and at the outer limits of what might be called a “youthful offender” within the principles stated in Hearne and other cases. In any event, against Bell J’s evaluation of the level of El-Zeyat’s culpability (considered under Ground 5), neither youth or immaturity could have any real bearing on the selection of the sentence.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no merit in proposed Ground 4.
	


Ground 5: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 61


	
	The nub of this proposed ground is that, in applying s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act her Honour failed separately to consider each of the four indicia stated in that submission. The “indicia” are retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence.
	
	
	The specific submissions included a submission that her Honour failed to consider the lack of evidence of ongoing dangerousness and that El-Zeyat’s history did not include any prior offences of violence that would have justified the conclusion her Honour reached. Again, it was submitted that the finding ought to be attributed to an unstated reliance upon the circumstances of the murder of Mr Fahda, and that the finding is explicable only on the basis of some “unexpressed” application of Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465.
	


Consideration of Ground 5


	
	The ground is, in truth, a restatement of Grounds 1 and 2, with an attempt to locate a basis for what is asserted to be the manifest excess of the assessment of objective gravity, and thus the manifest excess of the sentences.
	
	
	In R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557, this Court (Tobias JA, Wood CJ at CL and Hidden J) held that any combination of the stated indicia could lead to a conclusion of culpability of the kind contemplated by s 61(1).
	
	
	In my opinion, it is quite clear that her Honour considered the various indicia in s 61(1), and came to the requisite conclusion. This ground, in my opinion, has no merit.
	
	
	Since I have concluded that all pleaded grounds should fail, the appeal must be dismissed. I would nevertheless, since each has been fully argued, grant leave to appeal.
	


Aouad

Ground 1: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 61


	
	By the first ground proposed on behalf of Aouad, it was asserted that Bell J’s conclusion, in the terms of s 61(1), can now be seen to be erroneous. That, so it was asserted, is because Aouad’s conviction for the murder of Mr Fahda “contributed to” the conclusion that his level of culpability for the Razzak and Nemra murders came within the test stated in s 61(1). In support of this factual proposition, reliance was placed upon those passages in the Remarks on Sentence in which her Honour referred to the murder of Mr Fahda as “a planned execution” which took place just 16 days after the Lawford Street murders. In the written submissions it was then asserted:
	


“17  There is no doubt that the Fahda murder played a significant part in the decision that life sentences be imposed for the applicant.”

Support for that proposition was sought to be obtained from the following passage in [58] of the Remarks on Sentence:

“Having carried out these two murders each went on to execute Ahmad [sic - Ahmed] Fahda in circumstances of such callousness as, standing alone, to fall within the terms of s 61(1).”

Consideration of Ground 1


	
	There is little, if any, difference between what was argued in support of this ground, and the arguments put in support of El-Zeyat’s first and second grounds. This ground must meet the same fate as those.
	
	
	The submission is contradicted by the clear terms of [58] of the Remarks. Her Honour said:
	


“… each murder is one displaying very grave criminality. I have already commented on the ruthlessness of the Lawford Street killings as exhibiting an extreme degree of heinousness … Notwithstanding their relative youth, I have determined that the level of culpability of Naseam El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad for the commission of each of these three murders is so extreme that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of the maximum sentence.” (italics added)


	
	It could not be more clear that her Honour made a separate evaluation of the seriousness of each individual murder. As mentioned above in relation to El-Zeyat’s grounds, there is no indication in the Remarks that her Honour took into account the later committed murder of Mr Fahda when considering the seriousness of the earlier committed Lawford Street murders. In my opinion, it would have been erroneous to have done so (although it may have been permissible to have taken into account, in the sentencing for Fahda’s murder, the fact that Aouad had recently committed two other murders).
	
	
	There is no merit in this proposed ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2: manifestly excessive sentence


	
	The second ground proposed on behalf of Aouad is that the two sentences under present consideration were manifestly excessive. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported) in which recognition was given to “the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment”. It was submitted that Aouad’s level of culpability was not so extreme as to warrant the imposition of that penalty and that the objective criminality of the offences, Aouad’s role in them and the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could adequately be met by the imposition of a lengthy determinate sentence.
	
	
	Specific complaint was made that, in her Remarks, her Honour dealt with what was called “the entire subjective case” of Aouad in just four paragraphs, which did not address rehabilitation or risk of recidivism.
	
	
	Although the proposed grounds of appeal raise no issue of parity, a submission concerning the relativity of Aouad’s sentences with those of Darwiche was made. It was submitted that, to give effect to principles of parity, as stated in, for example, Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, Aouad’s sentence should fall below that of Darwiche.
	
	
	Finally, a number of matters said to be relevant to the assessment of the appropriate sentence were identified. These were:
	


“(a)  the applicant was only 22 years old at the time of the offence;

(b)  the applicant had a limited and fairly minor criminal history;

(c)  the applicant demonstrated a higher level of immaturity throughout the trial;

(d)  the Court was satisfied that the applicant was influenced by Darwiche;

(e)  the applicant was clearly acting at the direction of Adnan Darwiche;

(f)  there was no evidence to suggest that they were aware of Melissa Nemra’s presence at the house that night, and

(g)  for the applicant, it was a single reckless and dangerous act that resulted in the death of two people.”

Consideration of Ground 2


	
	As to the matters listed as relevant sentencing factors in (a)-(e) of [85] above, each was taken into account by Bell J as part of her overall assessment. All were expressly recognised. That Aouad was unaware (if he was) of the presence of Ms Nemra at Lawford Street on that night is of no relevance. It is clear that the offenders were intent upon shooting and killing members of the Razzak family. I repeat the comment at [63] above. It is hardly a mitigating circumstance that Aouad was party to an enterprise the purpose of which was to shoot and kill, which resulted in the death of a person who he did not know was present in the house. And to characterise the event as “a single reckless and dangerous act that resulted in the death of two people” is significantly to understate what the participants did. They set out with an intention of killing. That is not merely “reckless” and “dangerous”; it is, as Bell J said, an act of ruthlessness and great heinousness.
	
	
	Nor do I accept the parity argument. Principles of parity have no application when the level of culpability of an offender is such as to call for a life sentence.
	
	
	There is no merit in any of the grounds, or issues, raised on behalf of Aouad. In the case of Aouad also, I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.
	


Osman

Ground 1: asserted failure to reduce Osman’s sentence by reason of his classification as an Extreme High Security Inmate, and consequent more onerous conditions of custody


	
	It was submitted that it was erroneous for Bell J to decline to reduce the sentence imposed upon Osman by reason of his high security classification, and the consequent (assumed) more onerous conditions under which he would serve his imprisonment.
	


Consideration of Ground 1


	
	Her Honour noted that the evidence before her was that Osman was so classified “because of the seriousness of the outstanding charges”. It is not entirely clear whether the outstanding charges were the two murders or some other charges. Her Honour drew a distinction between prisoners who are housed on protection because of risks to their own safety arising out the nature of their offending (who are, at least sometimes, entitled to a reduction in sentence), and others, such as Osman, who are so classified because of their own behaviour. She said:
	


“76  … I infer that the assessment takes into account that he is a member of a group who engaged in an incident of extraordinary gun violence and may present more of a management risk than other prisoners.”


	
	There was no attempt to contradict the inference that her Honour drew.
	
	
	During the course of oral argument, it was put to senior counsel who represented Osman that it would be curious if a prisoner who was required to serve his sentence under high security conditions because of his dangerousness could thereby claim and receive a reduction in sentence. On this being put, the submission was no longer pressed.
	


Ground 2: totality


	
	At the time of trial Osman was serving sentences of imprisonment for an offence of supplying drugs, and for another offence of possessing a falsified passport. Bell J ordered that the sentences she imposed in respect of the murders of Mr Razzak and Ms Nemra commence on the expiration of the latter of the non-parole periods already being served, that is, on 11 October 2006. The argument under this ground was that the murder sentences ought to have been ordered to be served partially concurrently with the earlier imposed sentences.
	
	
	It was further submitted that her Honour failed to turn her mind to the principle of totality and, as a consequence, imposed a sentence of imprisonment that is manifestly excessive.
	


Consideration of Ground 2


	
	In my opinion it is wrong to say that her Honour did not apply her mind to the question of totality. The Remarks on Sentence at [74], extracted above, makes it clear that this is so.
	
	
	Her Honour gave reasons for accumulating the murder sentence on the pre-existing sentences: those offences were unrelated and called for their own terms of imprisonment. There is no substance in this proposed ground of appeal.
	


Ground 3: the standard non-parole period


	
	By this ground, error in the application of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, and the weight to be given to the standard non-parole period there prescribed is asserted. Her Honour found that Osman’s offences were above the mid-range of objective seriousness, and, having referred to the standard non-parole period, imposed sentences that included non-parole periods greater than the standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	I have above extracted [77] of the Remarks on Sentence, in which her Honour dealt with the standard non-parole period of 20 years applicable to offences of murder.
	


Consideration of Ground 3


	
	Her Honour was, in taking the standard non-parole period into account in the manner in which she did, loyally applying the relevant statutory provisions as they were then understood: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. Later, in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the High Court declared that understanding to have been wrong.
	
	
	In my opinion it is difficult to escape the inference that her Honour erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period, as it is now understood in the light of the decision in Muldrock. For this reason, it will be necessary to set aside the sentence and to re-sentence to Osman: see Kentwell. It follows that leave to appeal ought to be granted, the appeal allowed, and the sentences quashed. That makes it unnecessary to consider the final ground of appeal proposed.
	
	
	The question then arises as to the final disposal of Osman’s appeal. It is now 8½ years since he was first sentenced. At the commencement of the hearing of the applications, the Court raised with counsel the possibility of, in the event of success by any of the applicants, remitting the proceedings to a single judge for re-sentencing. The question not having previously been raised with counsel for the Director, she was noncommittal. By letter after completion of the hearing, the Court was advised that the Director was opposed to that course. That was, again, because of the long period of time since the original sentencing. The applicant accepted that this was an appropriate course.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the Director’s opposition, I am of the view that that is the appropriate course to take. Osman is to be re-sentenced in accordance with his relevant facts and circumstances as they now exist. The information available to the Court is stale and out of date.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


Naseam El-Zeyat

(1)  Extend the time in which to file an application for leave to appeal to 23 December 2013;

(2)  Grant leave to appeal against sentence;

(3)  Dismiss the appeal.

Ramzi Aouad

(1)  Extend the time in which to file an application for leave to appeal to 19 December 2013;

(2)  Grant leave to appeal against sentence;

(3)  Dismiss the appeal.

Abbas Osman

(1)  Extend the time in which to file an application for leave to appeal to 2 October 2013;

(2)  Grant leave to appeal;

(3)  Allow the appeal, set aside the sentences imposed by Bell J on 10 November 2006;

(4)  Remit for re-sentencing to a single judge of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW.

	HOEBEN JA:
	


Nature of proceedings

On 24 October 2010 the respondent (plaintiff) slipped on a path leading from the appellant’s (defendant’s) house. The respondent brought proceedings in negligence against the appellant alleging that certain steps on the path were excessively slippery.


	
	Those proceedings were heard by Finnane QC DCJ on 29 July – 1 August 2014, with judgment being delivered on 22 September 2014. The respondent was successful in her claim and was awarded damages in the amount of $736,435. The appellant has appealed and has challenged the judgment in three respects:
	



	
	The finding of negligence against him.
	
	
	The finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.
	
	
	The damages of $387,141 awarded in favour of the respondent for future paid assistance.
	


Factual background


	
	The following factual matters were either not in dispute or were findings made by the trial judge which have not been challenged.
	
	
	At the time she was injured, the respondent was aged 57, having been born in December 1956. Her home and that of the appellant adjoined each other. The appellant was an elderly man in his early nineties. The respondent frequently visited the appellant and his wife. This was because the appellant’s wife was ill with pancreatic cancer and he had problems with his feet, which the respondent used to treat. The distance between the two houses was about 500 metres.
	
	
	Approximately 18 months to 2 years before the respondent’s fall, the appellant installed steps on a path leading from his home to a street. There were three steps made from a substance known as “Caesarstone” which is used for benches in kitchens. It was common ground that Caesarstone becomes slippery when wet. Tests carried out on the Caesarstone steps by experts produced a BPN (British Pendulum Number) of between 34 (blue 143k) and 25 (blue 230n). The recommended BPN range for an external walkway was between 45 and 54.
	
	
	A couple of months after he had installed the Caesarstone steps, the appellant was descending them when he slipped . As a result of that slip, he attached squares of carpet to the top of the Caesarstone steps. There was no evidence as to the composition of the carpet, nor as to its capacity to prevent slipping. A single carpet square was placed on each of the steps, but the carpet did not cover the whole of the step at any level. Photograph A of Exhibit P1, which was a photograph of the steps with the carpet squares affixed to them, showed the carpet squares in the middle of the steps leaving a border on each side which was roughly the width of a brick placed lengthways.
	
	
	Photographs A, B and E of Exhibit P1 were taken from the perspective of someone moving from the appellant’s house and travelling in the same direction as the respondent. They showed that the path from the house initially comprised bricks placed into the earth and level with it. The path appeared to slope gently downwards from the house. Approximately half way along the brick portion of the path, a metal handrail commenced and extended to just beyond the first two Caesarstone steps, finishing at the beginning of the third step. The handrail was on the right side of the path as one moved from the house down the path.
	
	
	Photograph A of Exhibit P1 showed an earth track diverging to the left at the end of the brick portion of the path and slightly before the commencement of the first of the three Caesarstone steps. Again, the perspective is from a person moving down the path from the appellant’s house. The earth track was consistent with persons using the path, stepping off it to the left onto the grass before the commencement of the Caesarstone steps and walking on the grass next to, but not on, the Caesarstone steps. The earth track next to the path appeared to continue down to the road.
	
	
	Before the accident, the respondent had visited the appellant’s home on 50 or 60 occasions. Most of the time she would enter and leave by a side entrance. That was not possible on the day of the accident because the appellant had stacked some fire wood in such a way as to block that means of access or egress. This meant that the respondent was obliged to use the front entrance, i.e. the path which has been described. She had used this path to gain entry and leave the appellant’s premises about six times before the day of the accident. On none of those occasions had she used the Caesarstone steps, in going to or from the house. She would always walk on the grass rather than use the Caesarstone steps. She maintained that practice even after the appellant had placed carpet squares onto the steps. She did not use the Caesarstone steps because she regarded them as unsafe.
	
	
	On the day of the accident, the respondent had visited the appellant’s house in order to speak to his wife and to treat his feet. It had been raining heavily during the day. It was still raining when she left. She estimated her time of departure at between 7.30pm and 8pm. The respondent knew that the Caesarstone steps were slippery because she had been told, either by the appellant or by his wife, that he had slipped on them and that was why he had attached the carpet squares. At the time of the accident, the respondent was wearing sandals with a rubber sole.
	
	
	When the respondent left, she was carrying an umbrella in her right hand (she is right handed) and walked along the brick portion of the path. She had the intention of stepping off the path onto the grass and then walking the rest of the way on the grass to the road. She did not use the handrail, which was on her right side. Although her intention was to step off the path before she reached the Caesarstone steps, the respondent inadvertently placed her left foot on a part of the top Caesarstone step which was not covered by carpet. Her left foot slipped sideways causing her to fall and suffer injury.
	
	
	His Honour found that “her right foot struck part of the steps causing her to slip and suffer injuries” (Red 24N). It was agreed by the parties that his Honour was mistaken in that finding and that there was no evidence that the respondent’s foot struck a step. The mechanism of the accident was that her left foot slipped when it came in contact with a part, which was not covered by a carpet square, of the top of the first Caesarstone step.
	
	
	About 10 days after the respondent fell, workmen from the Department of Veteran Affairs came to the appellant’s property and placed non slip strips across the Caesarstone steps and installed another railing down the left side as one walked from the house. This can be seen in photographs X and Y of Exhibit P1. Five strips were attached to each step. The appellant subsequently spoke to the respondent about this and said:
	


“You’ll be happy next time you come up, you’ll be able to walk up my path this time because Veteran Affairs have fixed it up and it’s okay.”

Was the appellant negligent?


	
	The appellant has challenged the finding of negligence against him. He relies upon the following grounds of appeal. Since these grounds raise in different ways the same issue, they can be conveniently dealt with together. I have ignored Ground 1 since it was based on the factual mistake by his Honour which both sides acknowledged.
	


Ground 2 – The trial judge erred in finding that the risk was foreseeable.

Ground 3 – The trial judge erred in finding that the risk was not insignificant.

Ground 4 – The trial judge erred in finding that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have:

(a)   Either removed or replaced the steps with a ramp.

(b)   Placed a barrier around the steps to prevent the likelihood of anyone walking on them.

(c)   Totally covered the steps with some non-slip substance.

Ground 5 – The trial judge erred in finding that the state and condition of the steps were causally relevant in circumstances where the plaintiff was not walking on them and had chosen not to walk on them.

Ground 6 – The trial judge erred in failing to have regard to the measures taken by the defendant to render the steps safe for walking on, having regard to the way in which a reasonable person would have anticipated a person using the steps would walk on the steps.

Ground 8 – The trial judge erred in finding that it was reasonably foreseeable that the risk was not insignificant that a person would suffer injury when walking down the grass as a result of the person’s foot inadvertently coming in contact with a step.


	
	In relation to liability, the trial judge found that the Caesarstone was appropriate for bench tops in a kitchen, but was not suitable for steps because it was too slippery, particularly when wet. He found that the plaintiff would not step on the Caesarstone but followed the track across the grass because she was concerned that if she stepped onto the Caesarstone, she would slip. His Honour found that the appellant was aware that the Caesarstone steps were slippery because he had slipped on them. It was for this reason that he placed carpet squares in the middle of each of the three steps as a form of protection against slipping.
	
	
	His Honour rejected the proposition that it would have been perfectly safe for the respondent to walk on the carpet squares while grasping the rail to the right of the steps. This was because the composition of the carpet squares was not known and there was no evidence that they would have been slip resistant in rain and they may have become sodden and dangerous when wet. His Honour found that the respondent was justified in avoiding the steps because she considered them to be unsafe and was entitled to walk on the grass on a track that she was used to walking on and had walked on safely on other occasions.
	
	
	His Honour found that an appropriate response by the appellant to the known danger associated with the slippery steps was to have removed those steps and replaced them with a concrete ramp, or placed something around them to prevent a person’s foot from slipping on them. The formal findings which his Honour made in accordance with s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA) were:
	


“In formal terms I find:

The risk of the plaintiff slipping on the steps was foreseeable;

The risk was not insignificant;

In the circumstances, a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have done one of a number of things, either;

Removing and replacing the steps with a concrete ramp or;

Placing a barrier around the steps to prevent the likelihood of anyone walking on them or;

Totally covering the steps with some non-slip substance.” (Red 33G –M)


	
	In reaching that decision, his Honour relied upon two statements of principle. The first was that of the plurality (Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ) in Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; 162 CLR 479 at 488 where their Honours said:
	


“12   In the circumstances of the present case, the fact that the respondent was a lawful entrant upon the land of the appellant establishes a relationship between them which of itself suffices to give rise to a duty on the part of the appellant to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the respondent. …”


	
	His Honour also relied upon the observation by Gleeson JA in Reid v Commercial Club (Albury) Ltd [2014] NSWCA 98 where his Honour said:
	


“159   The scope of the occupier's duty of care is marked out by the relationship between the occupier and users exercising reasonable care for their own safety. Thus, ""the weight to be given to an expectation that potential plaintiffs will exercise reasonable care for their own safety is a general matter in the assessment of breach in every case"": Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Dederer and Another [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 at [45] (Dederer). This involves a factual judgment which may depend on the circumstances of the case: Thompson v Woolworths (Q'land) Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 19; 221 CLR 234 at [35].”


	
	The appellant accepted as correct the statements of principle relied upon by the trial judge and accepted that he owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the respondent. He did, however, challenge his Honour’s finding that this duty had been breached by him.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the relevant risk of harm was that a visitor would use the Caesarstone steps and would slip on them. He submitted that he had adequately responded to this risk by placing onto the steps squares of carpet in circumstances where there was a handrail to the right of the steps as one walked down the path from the house to the road. He submitted that his obligation was not to prevent or eliminate the risk of harm but to reduce that risk. He submitted that in those circumstances, he was not required to cover the whole surface of the steps with the carpet.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that if the risk of harm were that a person using the steps normally and taking reasonable care for their own safety might slip on them, that risk had been adequately answered by the attachment of the carpet squares. This was because such a person would tread on the carpet squares and not on those parts of the steps which were not so covered. He submitted that in those circumstances, it was not reasonably foreseeable by him that a person would step on those parts of the steps which were not covered by carpet.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the obligation which he owed to the respondent was that of a normal home owner to a guest. The same obligation should not be imposed upon him as would, for example, be imposed upon commercial premises where there would be hundreds of persons using the path. He submitted that the correct characterisation of what happened was that he, as an ordinary homeowner, recognised that the Caesarstone steps were slippery, responded to that risk by placing carpet squares upon them and that was all that he was required to do. He could then rely upon persons such as the respondent to take care for their own safety by stepping on the carpet squares and using the handrail. Nothing further was required of him. He submitted that the accident had occurred because the respondent was not using the steps in a normal way. That is how she came to place her foot on a part of the top step which was not covered by carpet. Had she been using the steps in a normal way, she would have placed her foot on the carpet squares and used the handrail.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that it was trite law that the question of breach had to be looked at prospectively from his point of view, making allowance for what he knew before the accident occurred. He submitted that once he had placed the carpet squares onto the steps, it was not reasonably foreseeable that a visitor would not use those steps but would tread upon an exposed portion of the Caesarstone on the far left of the path. In the alternative, the appellant submitted that even if such an event were foreseeable, the chances of it occurring were so low as to be insignificant thereby relieving him of any obligation to respond.
	
	
	When considering a breach of duty, regard has to be had to s 5B CLA. That section provides:
	


“5B(1)   A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a)    the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b)    the risk was not insignificant, and

(c)    in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions.

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a)    the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b)    the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c)    the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d)    the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.”


	
	When one applies s 5B to the facts of this case, it is apparent that the appellant’s submissions as to primary liability should be rejected.
	
	
	The risk of harm should not be defined in a narrow way. Here the risk of harm was that a person, moving from the house to the road, would slip on one of the Caesarstone steps, particularly in wet conditions. That risk was not only foreseeable in the sense that it “ought to have been known”, it was actually known by the appellant because he had slipped on the Caesarstone steps. His knowledge of that risk was confirmed by the expert opinion given at trial that the dynamic coefficient of friction was between .34 and .25 when the Caesarstone was wet. That is to be compared with the recommended level for the dynamic coefficient of friction of between .45 and .54. It is apparent that the element of slipperiness of these steps was well below the recommended level (Blue 230.J – Q).
	
	
	The appellant’s response to that foreseeable risk was to attach squares of carpet to part, but not all, of the Caesarstone steps. As his Honour pointed out, there was no evidence of what these squares of carpet were made and as to the extent, if any, of their anti-slip qualities. Dr Cooke, the expert retained on behalf of the appellant, was asked to assume that the carpet patches were made of a slip-resistant carpet-like material, but there was no evidence to that effect before the court. It follows that the evidentiary status of those carpet squares was that they were placed on the Caesarstone steps by the appellant following his own fall, but nothing is known about whether they reduced the slipperiness of the steps and if so, to what extent in wet conditions. If they did reduce the slipperiness, there was no evidence that they satisfied the relevant BPN safety standard or that of the dynamic co-efficient of friction. It remained unknown at trial as to whether this response by the appellant was adequate or not. Clearly the Department of Veteran Affairs did not think so, or it would not have intervened to apply non-slip strips to the steps approximately 10 days after the accident.
	
	
	It follows that there is no evidence that the appellant made the steps safer by adding the carpet squares or that the respondent would have been any safer treading on the carpet squares in the conditions which prevailed on that night, rather than following the course which she did.
	
	
	There is a further consideration which reinforces the conclusion that the requirements of s 5B have been made out. It is clear from photographs A and C of Exhibit P1 that the respondent was not the only person who regarded the Caesarstone steps with their carpet squares as dangerous and sought to avoid using them. This is apparent from the earth track, diverging to the left of the path, which appeared to be well worn. The worn nature of the track would have been obvious to anyone, including the appellant, who used the path. Accordingly, it was known that some persons were regularly avoiding the Caesarstone steps and using the grassed surface to the left of the steps in order to gain access to the road. Once that was known, it was foreseeable that such persons might miscalculate and inadvertently place a foot on the uncovered part of the Caesarstone, to the left of the top step, and slip. This is particularly so in rainy conditions when the person was holding an umbrella and when light conditions were not “pitch black dark but [were] getting onto night” (Black 37I).
	
	
	The question of when a risk is “not insignificant” was considered by Campbell JA (with whom Hoeben JA and Tobias AJA agreed) in Sibraa v Brown [2012] NSWCA 328 at [49] where his Honour said:
	


“49   The standard for a risk being ""not insignificant"" is not particularly high. In Shaw v Thomas [2010] NSWCA 169 at [44], Macfarlan JA (Beazley and Tobias JJA agreeing) said:

""In Wyong Shire Council v Shirt, Mason J referred to a risk 'which is not far-fetched or fanciful' as being 'real and therefore foreseeable' (at 48). The requirement in s 5B(1)(b) that the risk be 'not insignificant' imposes a more demanding standard but in my view not by very much.""”


	
	As noted above, it is clear from the photographs in Exhibit P1 that a number of persons using the path avoided the steps by stepping to the left of the path before reaching them. Because that was a relatively frequent occurrence, there was a risk that one of those persons would inadvertently step on the uncovered portion of the top Caesarstone step and if they did, a significant risk that such a person would slip and be injured. Accordingly, not only was the risk foreseeable in the relevant sense but it was a not insignificant risk, both from the point of view of the likelihood of occurrence, and the consequences if it did occur.
	
	
	For the reasons indicated, the response by the appellant was not adequate. The appropriate response was to remove or reduce the slipperiness of the Caesarstone steps. This could be done by adding non-slip strips, as did the Department of Veteran Affairs, or by otherwise appropriately covering the steps with a non-slip material or surface (Black 232J – K). The estimate of Dr Cooke for the cost removing and replacing the Caesarstone steps with safe steps was less than $1,000. It follows that a reasonable person in the appellant’s position, being aware of the risk of harm, should have taken one of those remedial steps.
	
	
	By reference to s 5B(2) CLA the probability that the harm would occur was reasonably high given the amount of foot traffic which had apparently created the track in the grass parallel to the Caesarstone steps. The consequences of a slip and fall could be serious and the cost of taking remedial action was modest.
	
	
	Although causation was raised in the grounds of appeal, it was not an issue in oral argument and it was based upon his Honour’s mistaken finding that the fall had been precipitated by a trip rather than by a slip. In any event, the evidence was overwhelmingly to the effect that if it were not for the extremely slippery nature of Caesarstone when wet, the respondent would not have fallen.
	
	
	It follows that the appellant has failed to establish that his Honour erred in finding that he was negligent and that his negligence caused the respondent’s injuries. The grounds of appeal challenging that finding should be dismissed.
	


Ground 7 – The trial judge erred in failing to find that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.


	
	His Honour’s findings on the issue of contributory negligence were:
	


“In my opinion she was exercising care for her safety and was choosing not to walk on the path at all because she did not think it was safe.” (Red 31X)

“The fact that her foot struck a corner of the first tile was mere inadvertence on her part.” (Red 32P)

“Since the plaintiff was taking reasonable care to avoid injury I find no contributory negligence against her.” (Red 33E)


	
	Having reviewed the evidence of the respondent as to how she came to fall, I have concluded that his Honour erred in finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent. The evidence made it clear that although the respondent was well aware of the slippery nature of the Caesarstone steps and intended to avoid treading upon them, she did not do so. The strong inference is that she was not paying adequate attention to where she was placing her feet. Her failure to take reasonable care for her own safety went beyond mere inadvertence. It cannot be explained by a lack of visibility. When that issue was raised with the respondent, she did not adopt it (Black 37J, 37U).
	
	
	The evidence relevant to the respondent’s understanding of what caused her to fall is as follows:
	


“Q. When you exited on 24 October 2010 I take it you were conscious of the steps in front of you? Were you?

A. I would say I would be subconscious, not like – I didn't walk out the front door and think ""Oh, steps are there.""” (Black 36M)

“Q. And where were you intending - what path were you intending to take?

A. The grass.

Q. Why was that?

A. Because it's the - it was the safest route, it was the route I always took.

Q. And were you in a hurry?

A. No.

…

Q. All right, and were you watching where you were going?

A. I thought I was.

Q. Did something happen to you?

A. To be honest, I just inadvertently took one step too many. I think that being inside with my friend and, you know, it's a little upsetting when somebody is passing.

…

Q. You've mentioned that - sorry, let me ask, what actually happened? What foot went where?

A. It happened so very fast, it was a split second. I believe my left foot went on the corner of that first tile and I just went sssshhhh towards the grass.” (Black 37C – G, 37M, 37X-Y)

“Q. That noise you just made, could you describe it in words do you think?

A. I put a foot down and I just slid out in that direction.

Q. Now, you're pointing with your hands in a forward motion, do you -

A. Sideways motion because I was walking off to the left.

Q. Right, what foot did you feel slip?

A. My left one.” (Black 38C – E)

“Q. I think I may have asked you before lunch, quite awhile before lunch, had you ever walked down the stairs before your fall?

A. I never walk on those steps, I always walk off the grass.

Q. As you were walking down the pavers to get to the grass pathway off

to your left, were you watching where you were going?

A. I would presume so. I was just naturally just walking home.” (Black 44L-O)

“Q. As you were leaving the premises, it was your intention not to step on these tiles?

A. Yes.

Q. You walked down the paved area depicted in Exhibit P1, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then as you gave evidence yesterday, you went to step onto the grass area?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it correct then that you put your foot in a position that you did not want to put it?

A. Yes.

Q. Your experience of life walking has included walking on wet surfaces, has it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you know that when one walks on wet surfaces they can become slippery because of water?

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact if there is heavy rain, they can become slippery because there might be greater moisture on there than expected?

A. Yes.

Q. You chose to put your foot on the grass, as I say, not on a tile?

A. Yes.

Q. You knew that there would be potentially water on the tile if you stepped on it?

A. Yes but at the time I wasn’t thinking about the tiles, I just walking home, it was just an overstep.” (Black 115Q – 116I)

“Q. In any event, you didn’t want to step on the hard tiled area when you were leaving Mr Stenning’s house?

A. No.

Q. Would you accept that it was a mistake by you as to where you placed your foot that caused you to fall?

A. I think it was just an inadvertent overstep.

Q. But would you accept that it was a mistake by you –

A. Yes.

Q. – where you put your foot, correct?

A. I’ve taken one step too many. Yes, it’s a mistake.

Q. Did you look at the tiles as you were leaving?

A. I can’t honestly say to you I was looking down to the ground the whole time I was walking, I just was walking my natural path home.” (Black 117G – N)

“Q. Is it correct to assume that you knew the surfaces of the tiles were wet?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see in fact that they were wet?

A. As I said before, I wasn’t looking down to the ground. It was raining. I was looking out straight in front of me to walk home.” (Black 117S – U)

“Q. If you had been careful and looked where you put your feet, you would not have put it on the tile?

A. I never intentionally put my foot on the tile.

Q. Because as you left it was obvious to you that there was potentially a slippery surface because of the rain?

A. That’s why I headed off to the left so I would avoid the tiles.

Q. You also knew that when there was water on hard surfaces, you needed to take extra care?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you in fact take extra care as to where you placed your foot?

A. I think I took the care that I would normally take when I was walking out of Bob’s and just walked down so far and veer off to the left.

Q. If I could perhaps ask you directly?

A. I don’t think I deliberately walked out there and thought it’s pouring down rain, there’s lots of rain, water on the stairs, there’s lots of it here, I won’t walk down those stairs ‘cos it was never my intention to walk down those stairs. This is a freak accident.

Q. Would it be correct to say that when you left these premises, you didn’t use any extra care in placing your feet as you left?

A. No, I took my normal route home the same way I would go home.” (Black 117Y – 118M)


	
	It is clear from those responses that the respondent failed to take reasonable care for her own safety in making sure that she did not tread upon the wet surface of the Caesarstone, which she knew to be slippery and dangerous.
	
	
	I do not, however, include in my finding of contributory negligence that the applicant failed to use the handrail on the right side of the path. She was intending to diverge to the left of the path when she reached the end of the brick pavers. She was right handed and carrying the umbrella in that hand. That combination did not make it unreasonable for her to walk towards the left side of the path away from where the handrail was located. Even if she had used the handrail, she would have needed to let it go before she reached the first of the Caesarstone steps to enable her to step off the path onto the grass to the left. In doing so, she may still have inadvertently stepped on the Caesarstone surface. The handrail would not have prevented her fall in those circumstances because she would have already let go of it.
	
	
	It remains to apportion responsibility for the respondent’s injuries between her and the appellant. In the CLA that exercise is not without its difficulties. These were identified by Beazley P (with whom Barrett and Gleeson JJA agreed) in Grills v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 72 where her Honour said:
	


“161   The effect of s 5R therefore is to require the court, in determining whether a person is contributorily negligent, to apply the provisions of s 5B and s 5C, being the statutory provisions applicable to determining breach. There may be a question whether any aspect of the common law continues to apply to the determination. However, that question does not need to be determined in this case.

162   As has been remarked in various cases in this Court, there is a conceptual difficulty in applying the general principles identified in ss 5B and 5C to the determination of contributory negligence: the question of breach is directed to whether a person has breached a duty owed to another person; contributory negligence, however, requires a determination whether a person has taken reasonable care for the person’s own safety. Once this difference in the fact finding task is recognised, the manner of application of s 5B becomes apparent. Consideration is required to be given to the statutory prescriptions in s 5B. In doing so, it is to be borne in mind that s 5B(2) is not limited to the factors identified in s 5B(2)(a)-(d) and that pursuant to s 5R(2), the standard of care is that of a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff and the matter is to be determined on the basis of what the person knew. Once a finding of contributory negligence has been made, the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, s 38(3) requires the court to reduce the damages recoverable “by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case”.”


	
	Although this is not a matter involving the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999, s  9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 applies which expresses the test in similar terms:
	


“9(1)   …

(b)   The damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.”


	
	It was the appellant who created the dangerous situation by constructing steps from Caesarstone which was acknowledged in the trial to be completely unsuitable for such a purpose. Even when the appellant became aware of how dangerous the steps were by slipping himself, he did not adequately respond to the risk of harm. Not only did he allow visitors to continue to use the path, but they were given no choice after he blocked the side entrance with fire wood.
	
	
	It is clear from that analysis that the appellant made a significant contribution to the occurrence of this accident. It is also clear that because he had actual knowledge of the risk of harm but did not adequately respond to it, his moral culpability was high.
	
	
	In contrast, the contribution by the respondent to the occurrence of the accident was much less. She played no part in bringing about the dangerous situation created by the Caesarstone steps. Her failure to take care consisted of being careless as to where she placed her foot in circumstances where she was aware of the danger. When one has regard to the conditions at the time, i.e. the approach of darkness with heavy rain, her contribution to the accident was much less than that of the appellant. I would apportion liability as to 85% against the appellant and 15% against the respondent.
	


Future assistance


	
	The following grounds of appeal are relevant to this issue.
	


Ground 9 – The trial judge erred in failing to have regard to s 15 of the Civil Liability Act in his assessment of damages for care.

Ground 10 – The trial judge erred in failing to have regard to all of the expert evidence on the issue of care.

Ground 11 – The trial judge erred in simply awarding the plaintiff the sum referred to in the plaintiff’s occupational therapy report, i.e. $430,156.67 (less 10% discount on account of the possibility of the plaintiff moving to a smaller house) without proper analysis or giving reasons as to the basis of the assessment.

Ground 12 – The trial judge erred in failing to have regard to the evidence of Dr Maxwell and the evidence of the plaintiff in assessing care.

Ground 13 – The trial judge erred in his allowance for past care.


	
	In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to summarise briefly the injuries suffered by the respondent and her continuing disability. I have based this summary on the medical evidence, which was accepted by his Honour, and on his Honour’s specific findings as to the capacity of the respondent.
	
	
	The respondent was born in December 1956, left school after obtaining her intermediate certificate and worked as a secretary. She married her first husband in 1977 and had three daughters with him. They were divorced in 1985.
	
	
	She married her present husband in 1988 and in 1994 they had a son, Stephen. He died in 2001 of a meningococcal infection. This caused the respondent immense grief and ultimately she and her husband set up a Foundation named after their son, aimed at ensuring that every child in Australia was inoculated against this disease. She was and is the driving force behind this Foundation.
	
	
	In 1980 the respondent had a car accident in which she injured her back. That injury does not appear to have produced any significant consequences. She underwent a left knee patellectomy in about 1996. She underwent a left total knee replacement, at the hands of Dr Dixon in 2002. Despite these problems with her left knee, the respondent was very active before the accident. She enjoyed cooking and did all the housework. In 2005 she and her husband moved to their present home which was a large bungalow residence constructed on a five-acre site. She was responsible for clearing the site and establishing gardens and orchards, rose beds and hedges. Her husband was a busy lawyer, who was not able to assist in these matters, although he was home on weekends. The respondent mowed the five acres of lawn on a ride-on mower, looked after her husband and from time to time looked after four of their five children and some grandchildren.
	
	
	As a result of this accident, the respondent suffered a fracture of her left wrist, damaged her left knee and loosened significantly the knee reconstruction. In December 2011 a Revision Left Total Knee Replacement with a bone graft was carried out by Dr Patterson. This operation was not entirely successful and in February 2013, her left knee was revised again with a new prosthesis placed into position.
	
	
	From a psychiatric point of view, the respondent became severely depressed following the death of her son and was treated for depression for two and a half years. She became quite depressed following this fall when she realised that she could not do what she had been able to do before being injured. By the time of the trial, however, this episode of depression had largely resolved.
	
	
	The respondent had resumed using the ride-on lawn mower, but it took her longer than previously because she had to mow the lawns in stages and then had to stop. This was because the vibration caused her injured leg to become painful.
	
	
	When doing work in the garden, the respondent took a stick or branch to give her steadiness, or she would lean on the arm of her husband or one of her children. The respondent found it difficult to stand for any length of time and still cannot kneel. She is unable to do very heavy work and cannot climb ladders. His Honour concluded (Red 40Q) that the respondent’s condition had now plateaued and that she would not experience further improvement.
	
	
	His Honour found that the respondent could no longer do heavy cleaning work and that she could not do any significant gardening work around the property.
	
	
	In relation to future assistance, his Honour found as follows:
	


“75   I have considered the reports of the two occupational therapists and the orthopaedic reports.

…

79   There is a major dispute as to the need for future provision being made for cleaning, gardening and outdoor maintenance. Ms Hammond, basing much of what she recommends on the opinion of Dr Maxwell, says an allowance should be made of $5900 and the defendant adds a further $10,000.

80   Dr Maxwell is of the opinion that the plaintiff will fully recover and get back to her pre accident state. I do not accept this. I consider that his opinion in this regard is not correct.

…

83   … If I accept what she says, she has permanent disabilities. I cannot accept what Dr Maxwell says, because her evidence is contradictory to what he says.

…

86   I accept Miss Flanagan's opinion about her need for provision of future domestic assistance, gardening assistance, outdoor maintenance, gutter clearing, but not including car washing, since there is no evidence that this was done on any regular basis by the plaintiff. The figures provided by her add up to $430,156.67.

87   I have decided to discount that by 10% because there must be a

very real chance that the plaintiff will leave this house before she dies and move to a smaller and more manageable house. The sum I will award to her under this head will be $387,141.00.”


	
	One of the challenges to his Honour’s assessment of the damages to be awarded to the respondent for future care, is that there was no “proper analysis or giving of reasons as to the basis of the assessment”. This criticism has been made out. It was not sufficient for his Honour to simply reject out of hand the report of the occupational therapist, Ms Hammond, and to accept with one small exception the assessment of the respondent’s occupational therapist, Ms Flanagan. It was necessary for his Honour to do more by way of analysis of the conflicting opinions to justify the finding which he made. Such an analysis did not need to be lengthy, but there did need to be a better consideration of the competing points of view in the experts’ reports under consideration than occurred here.
	
	
	This issue was comprehensively examined by Ipp JA (with whom Bryson JA and Stein AJA agreed) in Wiki v Atlantis Relocations (NSW) Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 174; 60 NSWLR 127 where his Honour said:
	


“56    A miscarriage of justice can arise where what is and is not disclosed in a judge’s reasons is a breach of the principle that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done: Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 431 (per Mason P). …

…

58   In Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd [2000] 1 WLR 377 which was followed in Moylan v The Nutrasweet Company [2000] NSWCA 337, Henry LJ said (at 381-382) in regard to the general duty of a judge to give reasons for his or her decision (particularly in relation to expert evidence):

“The duty is a function of due process, and therefore of justice. Its rationale has two principal aspects. The first is that fairness surely requires that the parties especially the losing party should be left in no doubt why they have won or lost. This is especially so since without reasons the losing party will not know … whether the court has misdirected itself, and thus whether he may have an available appeal on the substance of the case. The second is that a requirement to give reasons concentrates the mind; if it is fulfilled, the resulting decision is much more likely to be soundly based on the evidence than if it is not.”

…

61    But, where the issue in dispute involves differences between expert witnesses that are capable of being resolved rationally by examination and analysis, and where the experts are properly qualified and none has been found to be dishonest, or misleading, or unduly partisan, or otherwise unreliable, a decision based solely on demeanour will not provide the losing party with a satisfactory explanation for his or her lack of success. A justifiable grievance as to the way in which justice was administered will then arise.

62    In Moylan, Sheller JA (with whom Beazley JA and Giles JA agreed) referred to and adopted much of the reasoning of Henry LJ in Flannery. His Honour quoted the following remarks of Henry LJ (reported in Flannery at 381-382) with approval:

“It is not a useful task to attempt to make absolute rules as to the requirement for the judge to give reasons. This is because issues are so infinitely various. For instance, when the court, in a case without documents depending on eye witness accounts is faced with two irreconcilable accounts, there may be little to say other than that the witnesses for one side were more credible … But with expert evidence: See Bingham LJ in Eckersley v Binnie (1988) 18 Con LR 1, 77-78:

“In resolving conflicts of expert evidence, the judge remains the judge; he is not obliged to accept evidence simply because it comes from an illustrious source; he can take account of demonstrated partisanship and lack of objectivity. But, save where an expert is guilty of a deliberate attempt to mislead (as happens only very rarely), a coherent reasoned opinion expressed by a suitably qualified expert should be the subject of a coherent reasoned rebuttal, unless it can be discounted for other good reasons …‘”

And:

“… [w]here the dispute involves something in the nature of an intellectual exchange, with reasons and analysis advanced on either side, the judge must enter into the issues canvassed before him and explain why he prefers one case over the other. …”

63    Sheller JA (at [64]) criticised the trial judge in Moylan for deciding the case virtually solely on the strength of the following remarks:

“I have had the advantage not only of hearing the various witnesses give evidence but also of seeing the way in which they have reacted to the questions that they were asked. Having done so, I prefer the expert evidence that was given for the defendants to that which was given for the plaintiffs.”

64 In Mistral International Pty Ltd v Polstead Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 321, in a judgment with which both Meagher and Beazley JJA agreed, Sheller JA again referred to Flannery and Eckersley v Binnie with approval and applied what had been said in those cases. In Archibald v Byron Shire Council (2003) 129 LGERA 311 Sheller JA (with whom Beazley JA agreed) adopted the same approach. His Honour said (at 323, [54]):

“Where a dispute, such as this one, involves something in the nature of an intellectual exchange with reasons and analysis advanced on either side, the parties are entitled to have the judge enter into the issues canvassed before the court and to an explanation by the judge as to why the judge prefers one case over the other. This is particularly so where there is disputed expert evidence. In the present case, the parties were entitled to be told if Dr Button’s estimates were to be accepted, on what basis they were to be accepted, in preference to those of Mr Loomes and Mr Thompson. This had to be done if the court was properly to perform the duty of stating with certainty the extent to which the respondent was entitled to rely upon continued use.”

See also Papadopoulos v New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation [1999] NSWCA 116 at [17].”


	
	Since Ground 11 has been made out, and since neither occupational therapist gave evidence, this Court is in as good a position as the trial judge to assess what are appropriate damages for future assistance for the respondent.
	
	
	The recommendations by Ms Flanagan are set out at Blue 81D – M. The challenge to those figures by Ms Hammond is set out at Blue 188. There is agreement between the two occupational therapists as to the assistance which the respondent needs for house cleaning, i.e. 4.23 hours per week. That was generally conceded in the appeal. What was challenged by the appellant was the hourly rate of $40.40.
	
	
	The basis of the appellant’s challenge was the evidence of the respondent that she had been receiving assistance in house cleaning at the rate of 3½ hours per week, up to the time of trial, and had been paying $70 in total for that assistance. The appellant submitted that a figure of $70 for 3½ hours would more accurately represent the cost to the respondent of such assistance in the future.
	
	
	I do not agree. It is clear from the respondent’s evidence that she was unhappy with the standard of the cleaning which was provided. That may well be an explanation for why the respondent has been paying a significantly lower amount than the commercial hourly rate put forward by Ms Flanagan and Ms Hammond. There is another consideration. While the respondent has been able to obtain cleaning assistance for $70 for 3½ hours at the present time, that may not continue indefinitely. If the cleaner presently providing assistance were to cease working for her, the respondent would be obliged to pay the commercial hourly rate identified by Ms Flanagan. Accordingly, even if a figure of $70 for 3½ hours cleaning assistance were accepted, there would have to be a further amount added to allow for the very real chance that a cleaner charging such a low rate might no longer be available and that the respondent would have to pay the higher commercial rate.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, and having particular regard to the respondent’s evident dissatisfaction with the standard of cleaning assistance which she has been receiving, I am of the opinion that the prescription by Ms Flanagan of 4.23 hours per week, at a rate of $40.40 per hour is reasonable and should be allowed in the respondent’s favour.
	
	
	There was an issue between Ms Flanagan and Ms Hammond in relation to shopping. Ms Flanagan included in her figures 2 hours per week for the next 29 years for assistance when shopping. Ms Hammond did not make any allowance for this on the basis that the respondent currently shared the shopping with her husband, and that this was a reasonable contribution from him. There was evidence that the respondent’s husband does assist with the shopping and that he is at home on weekends and therefore available to assist. Shopping is a somewhat personal activity and most people would prefer to choose their purchases, rather than have somebody else do it for them. I accept the analysis of Ms Hammond and reject the assessment of Ms Flanagan of 2 hours per week assistance for shopping.
	
	
	Ms Flanagan allowed for window cleaning four times per year, at a weekly rate of $38.36. This is clearly a task beyond the respondent and should be allowed in her favour. Ms Hammond supported that recommendation although she would allow assistance twice a year. I prefer the approach of Ms Flanagan which is in accord with the respondent’s wishes.
	
	
	Ms Flanagan calculated the respondent’s need for outdoor maintenance (gardening, pruning, weeding, chopping trees/branches; lawn mowing and cleaning guttering) at 4.72 hours per week. Clearly, the respondent can do some lawn mowing, but the other activities are beyond her. It is also reasonable that she receive some assistance with lawn mowing as well, given that she has to rest when her leg becomes painful and performs this activity more slowly. I would allow 4 hours per week of assistance under this heading.
	
	
	His Honour deducted 10% from the total figure put forward by Ms Flanagan on the basis that the respondent and her husband might, as they get older, move to a smaller house and property which required less maintenance. While there was no evidence to that effect, that is a reasonable matter to take into account. Even if it were not, there would need to be some adjustment to allow for vicissitudes. With a life expectancy of 29 years, the ability of the respondent to engage in her pre-accident activities to the same level would inevitably be reduced as she became older. Accordingly, I agree with his Honour that a 10% deduction for vicissitudes is reasonable.
	
	
	In summary, the allowance I make for future care is as follows:
	



	
		
			
			House cleaning, including spring cleaning
			
			
			$170.89 per week
			
		
		
			
			Window cleaning
			
			
			$38.36 per week
			
		
		
			
			Outdoor maintenance
			
			
			$181.84 per week

	Using a multiplier for 29 years of 809.6, less 10% for vicissitudes, I would award damages for future care in the amount of $284,963.81.
	
	
	This means that the damages to which the respondent is entitled before the deduction for contributory negligence are:

	After adjusting for contributory negligence, the verdict is $539,692.78.
	


Costs


	
	The appellant has achieved some success in this matter in that he has obtained a finding of contributory negligence against the respondent and the damages awarded in her favour for future assistance have been reduced. Normally costs would follow the event and the appellant would be entitled to his costs of the appeal. In this case, however, three discrete issues were raised by the appellant which are readily separable. Moreover, the appellant spent a substantial amount of time in the appeal on the issue of primary liability. The appellant failed on this issue and had limited success on the other two issues.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, and subject to there being an application for a special costs order, I propose that no order for the costs of the appeal be made.
	


Orders


	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	The judgment entered in favour of the respondent on 22 September 2014 is set aside.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, judgment is entered in favour of the respondent in the amount of $539,692.78.
	
	
	Subject to any application for a special costs order, there be no order for the costs of the appeal.
	



	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2703013,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 8) [2015] NSWSC 1036,"Judgment - ex tempore (revised)


	
	At the conclusion of the opening address of Mr Waterstreet of counsel, who appears for the accused McNamara, Mr Thomas of counsel, who appears for the co-accused Rogerson, made an application that the jury be discharged. That application was supported by the Crown Prosecutor. The application, which was opposed by Mr Waterstreet, arises against the following background.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the opening address by the Crown, but prior to the commencement of the opening address on behalf of McNamara, I specifically drew counsel’s attention to the provisions of s. 159(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“the Act”) along with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 81, where Levine and Howie JJ made a number of observations as to the ambit of s. 159(2) of the Act or, put more specifically, as to the restrictions placed upon counsel for an accused in an opening address to a jury which follows the opening by the Crown. In particular, at [139] Howie J made reference to the fact that the purpose of a defence opening under s. 159(2) is to ""define for the jury's benefit the real issues in the trial"". His Honour went on to observe that the provision did not give counsel an opportunity to, amongst other things, embark on a dissertation on the onus and standard of proof, nor did it confer an opportunity to urge upon the jury the way that they should assess the evidence of a witness to be called in the Crown case. Although his Honour restricted that latter observation to evidence of a witness called in the Crown case, for my part I see no reason why that restriction ought not apply to the assessment of evidence generally.
	
	
	In the course of his opening address Mr Waterstreet, as he was entitled to do, informed the jury that in respect of the second count in the indictment, the accused McNamara would raise a defence of duress. That had been foreshadowed in a number of pre-trial applications that I have determined prior to today. However, having raised that issue, Mr Waterstreet said the following (commencing at T54 L29):
	


“You might think, from Mr McNamara's point of view, when Mr Rogerson pulled the gun out and shot Mr Gao, without any warning, without any ifs or buts, that the fear of Mr Rogerson was very apparent in the mind of Mr McNamara because he knew the reputation of Mr Rogerson. He knew that he had killed two, three people when he was in the Police Force. 

So, when a threat was made by Mr Rogerson, who having killed someone threatened to kill Mr McNamara, you might think that Mr McNamara had good cause to be afraid” (my emphasis).


	
	It is that passage which primarily forms the basis of the application to discharge the jury. Mr Thomas submits, amongst other things, that the terms in which that passage was put to the jury amounted to an assertion that his client had previously killed two or three people, and had done so other than in the course of his duty as a police officer. Mr Thomas also submitted provisions of s. 159(2) did not permit counsel for an accused, in the course of an opening address, to descend into discussing evidence which would obviously be the subject of objection and which, subject to my determination may be ruled inadmissible. Mr Thomas submitted that in all of those circumstances, the accused Rogerson could not receive a fair trial and that the jury should be discharged.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor supported Mr Thomas' application. In the Crown's submission, the accused Rogerson could not obtain a fair trial as a consequence of the prejudice which would inevitably flow from what had been said by Mr Waterstreet. The Crown highlighted the inherent difficulty in counsel opening on material which may ultimately not be evidence before the jury.
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet opposed the application. He submitted, amongst other things, that he was entitled to open to the jury in respect of an important issue such as duress. He further submitted that it was within the ambit of what was appropriate that he be permitted to open to the jury in relation to what he says the evidence will be in the trial.
	
	
	In support of his position, Mr Waterstreet referred me to two authorities. The first was a decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Gibb (1982) 7 A Crim R 385. Mr Waterstreet drew my attention specifically to a passage from the judgment of the Court (at 393) which was in the following terms:
	


“Joint trials of course raise difficulties, some of which cannot be foreseen at the outset. It is for this reason that a Court of Criminal Appeal must retain the power relied upon in Demirok, but that power will not generally be exercised merely because evidence which has been properly admitted in the case of one accused is inadmissible in the case of another and prejudicial to that other. Speaking generally, although the Crown may be inhibited to some extent by the evidence it can lead, an accused should be allowed to lead in his defence whether by way of calling witnesses or by a statement from the dock or by way of cross-examination of any witnesses called at the trial any evidence which is relevant to his defence. A trial judge, however, retains a discretion to exclude such evidence in a proper case but such an exercise of discretion will necessarily be rare. It is not to be exercised simply because one accused wishes to elicit evidence of the bad character of another accused.”


	
	The decision in Gibb (supra), a copy of which I obtained in the course of argument, appears to deal with issues concerning separate trials. The passage to which I have referred, and to which Mr Waterstreet drew my attention, expressly makes reference to the power of a trial judge having a discretion to exclude evidence. The decision also makes reference to circumstances in which one accused may lead evidence of the propensity of another accused to be violent. However, it says nothing at all about the limitations placed upon counsel in an opening address on behalf of an accused.
	
	
	The second authority to which I was referred was the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Oulds [2014] QCA 223. Mr Waterstreet submitted, as I understood it, that this decision supported the proposition that it was open to him, in the course of his address, to refer in detail to what he asserted would be evidence in the trial. That case involved (inter alia) a complaint made against trial counsel that he had failed to outline the case for the accused in his opening address. It is of some significance, in my view, that Holmes JA (with whom Fraser JA and Thomas J agreed) observed (at [65]) that in Queensland there is no prescription upon what may be said by counsel in an opening address. Her Honour went on to specifically observe (at [66]) the distinction which is to be drawn between the position in Queensland and that which operates in NSW. Her Honour made specific reference to the fact that the Act confers a limited right upon counsel for an accused to make opening address. In making that observation, her Honour made specific reference to the judgment of Howie J in MM (supra) to which I referred a moment ago.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to say (at [69]) that the decision in MM was of limited assistance because in the absence of a statutory provision, the parameters for the content of an opening address on behalf of an accused were determined by what the interests of justice required. In making that observation, her Honour was at pains to distinguish such a position from that which operated in States such as New South Wales where a statutory provision applies. In these circumstances, I do not consider that the decision in Oulds (supra) assists Mr Waterstreet’s position.
	
	
	As I have already observed, there is no issue that in an opening address to the jury counsel for an accused is entitled to draw the attention of the jury to those issues which are likely to arise in the trial. However, there is a clear distinction between the right of counsel to draw the jury's attention to issues (which is permissible), and descending into discussing evidence which may or may not ultimately be before the jury (which is not permissible). That is particularly so in circumstances where the matter to which Mr Waterstreet referred, and which has given rise to the present application, would obviously attract an objection by counsel for Rogerson and which would then be a matter upon which I would have to adjudicate. In my view, it is entirely inappropriate for counsel to descend into the evidence in that way. I do not accept the submission advanced by Mr Waterstreet that the provisions of s. 159(2) of the Act are to be relaxed, to any degree, in a case where the joint accused are to engage in what might be described as “cut throat defences”.
	
	
	Although Mr Thomas' application, and the Crown's support of that application, was limited to the one circumstance to which I have referred, there were other aspects of counsel's address which, in my view, amounted to a clear traversal of the provisions s. 159(2) of the Act.
	
	
	For example, commencing at T53 L16, Mr Waterstreet said the following:
	


“You will hear Mr Thomas open on matters that he suggests will prove his case and lead to his acquittal.”


	
	It is no part of the role of counsel for one accused in the course of opening address to comment upon what counsel for another accused may or may not say. Moreover, the terms of what was said amounted to a clear reversal of the onus of proof. There is no onus on either accused to prove anything in this case. To suggest, in the course of an opening address, that there was an onus on a co-accused to point to matters which would “prove his case and lead to his acquittal” was, in my view, grossly improper.
	
	
	There was also a reference in the course of Mr Waterstreet's address to an asserted association between Rogerson and ""bikies"". In particular, the following was said (commencing at T56 L42):
	


“In other words, the issues would be whether Mr McNamara had any connection with bikies but rather the evidence might suggest, we say, Mr Rogerson had connections to bikies because in the days after this murder, and the days after there was a gathering at a hotel, friends of Mr Rogerson, including a powerful leader of a gang of bikies who was a friend of Mr Rogerson. So that in assessing the evidence, what Jamie was intending to do with the drugs that he hoped to sell, you might think, who, among the two, who had any connection whatsoever with the bikies. Not Mr McNamara” (my emphasis).


	
	The unacceptability of making reference to what the evidence “might” suggest will be self-evident. However, that paragraph is also significant in the light of a submission which was made on behalf of the accused McNamara in an earlier pre-trial application which came before me. On that particular occasion, I was dealing with an application by the Crown Prosecutor (upon which I have since ruled) that he be permitted to rely on representations of the deceased which would otherwise be caught by the hearsay rule. The transcript will reflect that in the course of the argument in relation to those issues I made the observation that some of the representations were contained within paragraphs of witness statements which included material which was highly prejudicial. In responding to the Crown's position Mr Lange of counsel (who for the purposes of that application appeared with Mr Waterstreet) said the following (in written submissions) in respect of one such representation upon which the Crown relied:
	


“Moreover, given the prejudice which invariably attaches to the term 'bikie', it is submitted that the risk of unfair prejudice outweighs the slight probative value.”


	
	After I had heard argument in relation to those matters, I came to the conclusion that references to the accused McNamara being involved with “bikies” were indeed highly prejudicial and that the Crown should not be permitted to rely upon them. The very same term was used by Mr Waterstreet in the course of his opening address in connection with Rogerson. How it could possibly have been thought that the use of such a term was prejudicial to one accused but not another is frankly beyond me. There is a serious incongruity, in my view, between an accused asserting that the use of the term ""bikie"" carries with it unfair prejudice when it is used in reference to himself, and relying on the very same term, in the course of an opening address, to describe the co-accused's association with others. This is particularly so when the highest it is put is that the evidence “might” suggest that this is the case.
	
	
	Further, in the course of his opening address, and on more than one occasion, Mr Waterstreet invited the jury to engage in an analysis of the evidence. One does not have to pause for too long to realise the difficulty in extending such an invitation when no evidence has yet been given. For example at T59 L28-29 the following was said:
	


“I want to suggest to you that the evidence properly analysed and the credit or the versions given to you, as I anticipate Mr Rogerson's version--”


	
	It was at that point that I interjected and asked counsel, not for the first time, to confine himself to the issues. An invitation to the jury, in the course of an opening address by counsel for an accused, to engage in an analysis of the evidence was one of the matters specifically referred to by Howie J in MM as being inappropriate. Such an invitation is rendered even more inappropriate when it is an invitation to analyse the co-accused’s “version” of events which has not yet been given. In MM Howie J expressly said (at [139]) that the opportunity for defence counsel to open to the jury at the commencement of a trial was not an opportunity to urge upon a jury the way that the jury should assess the evidence. His Honour referred in this context to “a witness to be called in the Crown case"". It is no different, in my view, when the jury are asked to assess evidence of a co-accused.
	
	
	The matter raised by Mr Thomas and supported by the Crown is, in my view, sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the accused Rogerson could not receive a fair trial. That matter, along with the additional matters to which I have referred, demonstrate the extent to which, in the course of his address, counsel went significantly beyond what was permitted or appropriate.
	
	
	I therefore order that the jury be discharged.

		15 June 2016",2015-07-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703020,Sparkes v R [2015] NSWCCA 203,"Judgment


	
	Price J: Paul Anthony Sparkes (the applicant), seeks leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta, on 20 June 2014, by Colefax SC DCJ (the judge). The Crown does not take issue with the Notice of Appeal being filed out of time. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Parramatta Local Court to one count of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the first count) and one count of take and drive conveyance contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (the second count). He adhered to those pleas before the judge.
	
	
	An offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for 5 years. There is no standard non-parole.
	
	
	The applicant asked the judge to take into account on sentence a further three charges that had been included on two “Form 1’s” pursuant to s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In relation to the first count, he asked that one charge of intentionally damage property contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and one charge of larceny contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act be taken into account. In relation to the second count, he asked that a further charge of take and drive conveyance contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act be taken into account.
	
	
	On 20 June 2014, the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 6 years 4 months. A non-parole period of 4 years 9 months was fixed by the judge commencing on 23 September 2013 and expiring on 22 June 2018, with a balance of term of 1 year 7 months commencing on 23 June 2018 and expiring on 22 January 2020.
	
	
	The judge had earlier stated in his sentencing remarks that the indicative sentence for count one (including the matters on the Form 1) was 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 11 months. The indicative sentence for count two (including the matter on the Form 1) was 4 years. His Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, but he declined to find special circumstances.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Before dealing with the appeal, it is useful to refer to some of the material that was before the judge.
	
	
	An agreed statement of facts were tendered, as was the applicant’s criminal and custodial histories. The Crown Advocate provided to the judge an aide memoire that detailed the various periods of imprisonment which the applicant was serving.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence, but two reports of Miss Caroline Hare, psychologist dated 16 June 2014 (ex 2) and 26 July 2013 (ex 1) were tendered in his case.
	


FACTS


	
	The facts of the offences were recounted by the judge on pages 1-3 of his sentencing remarks. The applicant’s counsel in written submissions provided a helpful summary of the facts that I propose to adopt (AWS pg3-4):
	


“Aggravated Break, Enter and Commit a Serious Indictable Offence [Count 1]

On 17 September 2013, at about 2:45am, the applicant and an unknown co-offender attended the residence at … Toongabbie. The victim and her adult son were asleep inside the premises at the time. The applicant entered the premises through the fly screen door and the main door, which was closed but not locked. The applicant removed the victim’s handbag and car keys from the house. The applicant and his co-offender looked through the handbag and removed the victim’s wallet, before leaving the handbag on the driveway. The wallet contained personal cards and about $410 in cash. The applicant used the car keys to unlock and access the victim’s silver Ford Falcon.

Take and drive conveyance [Count 2]

The applicant entered the driver’s seat of the silver Ford Falcon,…, and reversed it out of the driveway and away from the premises.

Intentionally Damage Property [Form 1a – Count 1]

In order to gain access to the Silver Ford Falcon, it was necessary to move a black Ford Utility,…, parked behind it. The applicant therefore smashed the side window of the utility, leant in and released the handbrake. The co-offender pushed the utility out of the driveway and left it stationary in the middle of…[the] Road.

Larceny [Form 1a – Count 1]

The applicant also stole a wallet from the utility, containing $500 in cash, a driver’s licence, a keycard and personal papers.

Take and drive conveyance [Form 1b – Count 2]

Between 11:30pm on 7 September 2013 and 6:30am on 8 September 2013, the applicant broke into residential premises at…, Dean Park, obtaining the keys to Holden Commodore…, which he then stole.”

Some findings by the judge


	
	The judge found:
	



	
	an aggravating feature of both offences is that the applicant was on conditional liberty, namely s 11 bail at the time;
	
	
	the objective seriousness of count 1 was below mid-range but not at the bottom of the range of seriousness;
	
	
	the objective seriousness of count 2 was slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness;
	
	
	the applicant was 23 years old. He had a very unhappy background. He was the only child of his parents both of whom were Aboriginal Australians. The relationship between his parents ended when he was two years old. The applicant had no adult supervision of a positive kind since the age of 14 years;
	
	
	at the age of 12, the applicant commenced consuming alcohol and ice. At 15 years, he was smoking methamphetamine on a daily basis and also started using ecstasy and speed. He graduated to smoking heroin at the age of 17;
	
	
	the applicant “never had an effective treatment for his sustained, prolonged and multifaceted drug abuse issues” (ROS 5);
	
	
	the applicant had an appalling criminal history. As an adult, his criminal activities since 2008, included “driving offences, aggravated assaults, aggravated break and enters, police pursuits, stealing motor cars and the like” (ROS 5);
	
	
	the applicant had no diagnosable mental illness “at this stage” (ROS 5);
	
	
	the applicant had not expressed remorse and had poor prospects of rehabilitation;
	
	
	the plea of guilty was entered at the first opportunity and it was appropriate he be given a 25 per cent discount; and
	
	
	the Crown’s aide memoire chronology showed the various periods of imprisonment which the applicant had served and was continuing to serve. His earliest release date was 4 February 2016. Whilst there was much to be said for the start date being later than the date of his arrest, “by reference to his age and having regard to notions of totality, the start date will be the date of his arrest, namely 23 September 2013” (ROS 6).
	



	
	The applicant does not challenge any of these findings.
	


Argument


	
	The applicant contended in written submissions that the aggregate sentence was excessive both in respect of the head sentence and the non-parole period. The applicant submitted that the indicative sentence should have incorporated the 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. If this discount had been applied to the indicative sentences, the applicant pointed out that the starting point for those terms must have been 9 years 4 months for count 1 and 5 years 4 months for count 2. The indicative sentence for count 2, the applicant said, was in excess of the maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and was clearly beyond what was reasonable (or indeed available) for an offence “slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.”
	
	
	Although the applicant accepted that the indicative sentences are not of themselves appealable, the judge’s indicative sentence for count 2 was a clear guide to the existence of manifest excess. Furthermore, the indicative sentence for count 1, the applicant argued, did not appear consistent with the judge’s findings about the objective seriousness of that offending.
	
	
	The applicant referred to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics which were said to demonstrate that 65 per cent of offenders who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act, less than two per cent of offenders were sentenced to a non-parole period of more than four years. As to the offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the statistics disclosed that no offender sentenced for that offence in the District Court has been sentenced to imprisonment in excess of 3.5 years.
	
	
	Another argument was that the benefit to him of commencing the sentence from the date of arrest was offset by the judge declining to find special circumstances. He was, it was said, a person with a very significant drug abuse problem which demonstrated a need for an extended period of supervision upon return to the community.
	
	
	In oral address, the applicant argued that the applicant’s drug addiction at a young age was a mitigating factor. The applicant also referred to his present age of 23 years and the risk of institutionalisation.
	


Decision


	
	The applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust in order to make good his complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Intervention by this Court is not warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57].
	
	
	The applicant’s argument of manifest excess is founded upon the submission that the judge’s indicative head sentence of 7 years for count 1 and 4 years for count 2, did not take into account the 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty. If this was the case, the undiscounted starting point for count 1 was 9 years 4 months and 5 years 4 months for count 2. Such an indicative sentence for count 2 would have plainly been excessive as it exceeded the maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The total undiscounted indicative sentence would have been 14 years 8 months.
	
	
	Should the judge not have taken into account the 25 per cent discount before announcing the indicative sentences, the total undiscounted indicative sentence would have been 11 years. After applying the discount of 25 per cent, the indicative head sentence for count 1 would have been 5 years 3 months and 3 years for count 2.
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks, the judge did not state that the indicative sentences had been discounted. However, before imposing the aggregate sentence, his Honour said (ROS 7):
	


“Except for your plea of guilty I would have imposed an aggregate sentence of eight years and six months. Because of the plea of guilty, the term of the sentence will be six years and four months.”


	
	In my view, the undiscounted aggregate sentence of 8 years 6 months sits happily with a total undiscounted indicative sentence of 11 years. It, however, does not bear a reasonable relationship with a total undiscounted indicative sentence of 14 years 8 months. Furthermore, I do not think that the judge, who is an experienced sentencing judge, would indicate a sentence for count 2 that was more than the maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the indicative sentences are reflective of error in relation to the aggregate sentence imposed by the judge. In any event, the “principal focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest … excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved”: JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [13] (R A Hulme J).
	
	
	I do, however, mention that sentencing judges should apply the relevant sentencing discount when setting an indicative sentence and state that they have done so.
	
	
	The applicant does not challenge the judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending.
	
	
	Although the applicant’s offences were not the most serious of their kind, the applicant’s offending occurred at a time that he was on conditional liberty. On 13 August 2013, he was granted bail by Craigie SC DCJ under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, having pleaded guilty to earlier unrelated charges of aggravated assault with intent to take or drive a motor vehicle and an aggravated break enter and steal. The conditions of his s 11 bail, included that he enter the Glen Rehabilitation Centre and remain there for 12 weeks from 14 August 2013, until 13 November 2013. The present offences were committed only five weeks after his release from custody. This was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	The judge described the applicant’s prior criminal history “as appalling”. His Honour was entitled to have regard to the applicant’s record of offending in giving more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 and R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159.
	
	
	The judge plainly took into account the applicant’s subjective case. He referred in his sentencing remarks in some detail to the applicant’s age, his difficult background, his lack of positive adult contact since the age of 14 and the early age that he became addicted to drugs. The applicant makes no complaint about the judge’s finding that he was not remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation are poor.
	
	
	It is often stated that the upper limit of the range of sentences is not provided by the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics, but this material provides guidance and achieves consistency in sentencing: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1.
	
	
	As the Crown submits, in the applicant’s case, the statistics have limited value as the Judicial Commission database does not provide as one of the factors that can be selected to attempt to individualise the statistics, the aggravating feature of being on conditional liberty at the time of the offending. Furthermore, whatever assistance is provided by the statistics is limited when an offender is subject to a number of different sentences that overlap.
	
	
	At the time the applicant was sentenced by the judge, he was serving sentences of imprisonment with an effective non-parole period to expire on 4 February 2016. The applicant had been arrested on 17 September 2013, but none of his pre-sentence custody prior to the date of sentence, was wholly referable to the present offences. His Honour’s commencement of the sentences from the date of arrest was, in my opinion, generous to the applicant. The result was an effective non-parole period of just over 2 years 4 months.
	
	
	In my view, it was open to the judge in the exercise of his discretion not to find special circumstances. The applicant’s lack of remorse, poor prospects of rehabilitation and breach of s 11 bail, did not assist a finding of special circumstances founded on a need to overcome his drug addiction.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence imposed by the judge was in any way manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


1.   Leave to appeal granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL: I agree.
	
	
	Fagan J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	Hoeben CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be those proposed by Price J.

2703025,New South Wales Crime Commission v Liu [2015] NSWSC 1305,"Judgment – Ex Tempore


	
	HER HONOUR: This is an application for restraining orders and related relief in respect of all of the interests in property of Xia Liu. The application is brought pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). That section provides that the Commission may apply to this Court for a restraining order ex parte. Subsection (4) provides that, despite an application being made ex parte, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to certain persons. On the strength of the material relied upon in support of the present application, I do not think it is either necessary or appropriate to impose such a requirement.
	
	
	Subsection (5) of s 10A provides that the Court must make a restraining order if certain conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating certain things. In the present case, the application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathon Lee Spark sworn yesterday. The affidavit states Mr Spark's suspicion of the matters identified in the section and states the grounds on which that suspicion is based. The material received by Mr Spark included a statement of facts prepared by police in respect of charges of money laundering against the defendant. Mr Spark made inquiries of the author of the fact sheet and asked the relevant detective to state whether, to the best of that person’s knowledge and belief, the contents of the fact sheet were true and that it was prepared on the basis of information obtained by police as a result of the investigation described. In each case an affirmative answer was received.
	
	
	I have read the fact sheet myself. I consider, having regard to those matters, that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion deposed to by Mr Spark.
	
	
	Each of the requirements of the section is satisfied. In accordance with s 10A of the Act, it follows that I must make the restraining order sought.
	
	
	The other relief on which the Commission moves today is ancillary relief of the kind commonly ordered in such cases, including orders for examination of two persons on oath, leave to obtain dates for those examinations and an order that the defendant furnish certain material to the Commission within a specified period. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make those orders.

		07 September 2015",2015-07-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703030,R v Castaneda (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 979,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: On 17 July 2015 I allowed the accused to adduce evidence relevant to an assessment of the credibility of the deceased, over the objection of the Crown. These are my reasons for so doing.
	
	
	The evidence the accused seeks to adduce concerns events from the deceased’s life which could be suggestive of dishonesty on his part. The credibility rule (s.102 of the Evidence Act 1995) ordinarily precludes evidence of this nature from being given, subject to certain exceptions.
	
	
	In 2001, when serving with the United States Air Force the deceased, Gregory Peck, was court martialled for offences of burglary and larceny. Although details of the offences are few, the burglary relates to a break and enter of a retail store, and the theft of property from the store. It appears that the larceny charge reflects that theft, rather than a separate crime. The deceased was convicted at his court martial, and sentenced to confinement for thirty days, forfeiture of a percentage of salary for a period, and “reduction to E-1” (VD Ex. M), presumably some loss of rank or other status. 
	
	
	In January 2009, after moving to Australia to live and work, the deceased was dismissed from his employment with Invacare for some alcohol related misconduct (VD Ex. K). I have already excluded that evidence as amounting to no more than evidence of bad character (R v Castaneda [2015] NSWSC 964) but the accused now seeks to rely, not upon evidence of the misconduct and dismissal previously excluded but rather, upon the deceased’s failure to disclose those matters in subsequent applications for employment. 
	
	
	Evidence of this nature is clearly “credibility evidence” as defined by s.101A of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”). 
	


101A Credibility evidence

Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:

(a)    is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or

(b)    is relevant:

(i)   because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and

(ii)   for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.


	
	Mr. Strickland, senior counsel for the accused, relies upon s.108A of the Act as providing a basis for the admissibility of this evidence. The Crown argues that it is excluded by s.102 of the Act, and is not encompassed by s.108A.
	
	
	Section 108A provides:
	


(1) If:

(a)   evidence of a previous representation has been admitted in a proceeding, and

(b)   the person who made the representation has not been called, and will not be called, to give evidence in the proceeding,

credibility evidence about the person who made the representation is not admissible unless the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the person’s credibility.

(2)      Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:

(a)   whether the evidence tends to prove that the person who made the representation knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the person was under an obligation to tell the truth, and

(b)   the period that elapsed between the doing of the acts or the occurrence of the events to which the representation related and the making of the representation.


	
	The accused contends that the evidence of the deceased’s convictions in 2001, and his dishonest omission in failing to disclose his dismissal from his position with Invacare in later employment applications, is admissible because of the relevance of this evidence to an assessment of the deceased’s credibility. 
	
	
	The Crown has led evidence of four separate representations made by the deceased to others, which the Crown relies upon to establish the context in which it alleges the accused murdered the deceased, and also to establish a tendency on the accused’s part to be violent towards the deceased. 
	
	
	The previous representations of which the Crown has led evidence are as follows.
	
	
	Craig Beechey gave evidence on 17 July 2015 that, on 11 April 2012 the deceased telephoned him. Mr. Beechey deposed that the deceased said,
	


“[…]  ‘You’re not going to believe where I am’ and I said, ‘Where?’, and he said, ‘Hiding behind bushes beside my house.  She’s [the accused's] running round the house with a knife trying to find me.” (T201:3 of 17 July 2015)


	
	On 12 May 2012 Mr. Beechey was again told by the deceased of violence inflicted upon him by the accused:
	


“[…] he [the deceased] had a small cut above his eye and his - his right eye.  It was above the eyebrow.  It was a little bit discoloured, bit reddish in colour and he said that she’d lost it and came at him with the beer bottle.”  (T201:36 of 17 July 2015)


	
	The deceased also told Mr. Beechey about an incident at a Christmas function in December 2012, when,
	


“ […] he said that she’d lost it again and threw a glass at him.” (T202:33 of 17 July 2015)


	
	The Crown also led evidence from Andrew Hargreaves, on 16 July 2015, about an incident in 2012 when the deceased attended his place of employment (then at the RAAF base at Richmond) with a black eye. The deceased told Mr. Hargreaves that the accused had “smacked him in the eye with a mobile phone” (T171:41 of 16 July 2015) after an argument about the volume of the television that the deceased had been watching.
	
	
	The Crown having led evidence of these previous representations made by the deceased to Mr. Beechey and Mr. Hargreaves, in circumstances where the deceased obviously cannot be called as a witness, the accused submits that credibility evidence of the nature sought to be led could substantially affect the assessment by the jury of the deceased’s credibility: s.108A(1). 
	
	
	“Substantial"" (or ""substantially”) is not defined by the Act or the Dictionary to the Act. It is however, a familiar word in the context of evidentiary rules since it is used frequently in the Evidence Act.  “Substantially” appears in s.79, s.101, s.103, s.108C, s.111, s.126H, s.135, s.138 and s.177.
	
	
	Evidence which could be important, or of real and persuasive significance, when assessing the reliability of statements made by the deceased, must be capable of substantially affecting the assessment of the deceased’s credibility.
	
	
	The context in which the assessment is to be made is important and is, to a significant extent, established by the nature of the case the Crown seeks to prove against the accused.
	
	
	The Crown case, as it was opened to the jury, is that, in stabbing the deceased in the chest with a single fatal blow delivered on 22 February 2013, the accused was not, as she asserted immediately in a call recorded by the Triple 0 emergency service, acting in self-defence, but in retaliation or having been angered by the deceased’s conduct. 
	
	
	There is nothing in the evidence of the stabbing and its immediate aftermath that can support the Crown case in that regard.
	
	
	Only the accused and the deceased were present at the time of the fatal incident, and the deceased did not survive the blow long enough to give an account of it. Thus only the accused’s account is available. The accused has consistently asserted that the deceased attacked her and, fearing for her safety, she pushed out at him to stop his onslaught, striking the fatal blow in the process. Although the level of detail given by Ms. Castaneda differed between conversations, she has consistently maintained the content, that is, that she acted in self-defence. This was asserted to the Triple 0 operator, to the first police to respond to her call for help, and to her former husband, to whom she spoke in the hours after the stabbing. Her accounts to these individuals are all available to the jury to go to the truth of what she said: s.66 of the Act.
	
	
	That the deceased in fact attacked Ms. Castaneda as she claimed, and that she had reasonable cause to be fearful, is made more probable by evidence that the deceased had subjected the accused to earlier acts of violence, resulting in the attendance of police to the couple’s home on at least one occasion, and in the issue of an interim apprehended domestic violence order against the deceased for the protection of the accused, in 2012.
	
	
	The reliability of the accused’s claims in this regard must be discredited or rebutted if the Crown is to negative self-defence and establish the offence charged. To do so the Crown has led evidence in an attempt to establish that the accused had been violent to the deceased prior to the fatal stabbing, and that she had a tendency to be violent towards him more generally. Part of that evidence is the representations made by the deceased to Mr. Beechey and Mr. Hargreaves. 
	
	
	In that context, what the deceased said to others about the accused’s supposed violence has the capacity to have great importance to the jury’s consideration of whether the Crown has negatived the issue of self-defence. Indeed, it may take on a degree of prominence.
	
	
	That being the case, evidence which can inform the jury’s assessment of the deceased’s credibility may have importance.
	
	
	In considering whether the evidence could substantially affect the assessment to be made by the jury of the credibility of the deceased regard must be had to those matters set out in s.108A(2) of the provision. The matters there listed are not exhaustive. Section 108A(2)(a) refers to whether or not the evidence tends to prove that the maker of the representation made a false representation when subject to an obligation to be truthful. Plainly, evidence which is indicative of any disregard for such an obligation, such as the obligation that applies to a witness giving evidence in court proceedings, could have very considerable importance, in that it may suggest that a witness did not take his or her oath or affirmation seriously, and was a person not be believed.
	
	
	The fact that the representations were not made at a time when the deceased was obligated to be truthful would ordinarily militate against the admission of credibility evidence. It can probably be comfortably said that many people fail to be always and completely truthful in every aspect of daily dealings with others, but that failure may say nothing at all about an individual’s overall credibility, and need not be addressed by the admission of credibility evidence.
	
	
	The representation as to the deceased’s employment history raises some question of obligation in that, despite the evidence of Mr. Beechey on the point, there is a general obligation upon candidates for employment, which is moral and sometimes legal, to give a truthful account of matters relevant to work history. In some circumstances, it could constitute an offence against the criminal law if a job applicant were not truthful about a material matter in his or her work history. I do not regard the issue of temporality as of great significance here: s.108A(2)(b).
	
	
	It must be borne in mind however that s.108A(2) is not an exhaustive list of relevant considerations, and nor does it dictate the resolution of the issue posed by s.108A(1).
	
	
	The pertinent question is the capacity of the credibility evidence the accused wishes to lead to substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the deceased, and thus whether or not his statements concerning the accused’s violence towards him are such as the jury should accept as reliable.
	
	
	In a case where the issue of self-defence is the only issue that the jury will have to determine, whether or not the deceased was always a reliable historian about matters personal to him must take on great weight. If he was a person whose account of personal matters could generally be accepted as reliable and credible, it would be open to the jury to give considerable weight to his previous complaints of violence towards him by the accused when assessing the accused’s claims to have acted in self-defence.
	
	
	If there are matters that could suggest that he was not always or even mostly a reliable historian, the jury may be more sceptical when assessing whether the Crown has negatived the issue of self-defence. That is, it would be open to the jury in possession of such evidence to view the Crown’s argument (advanced in reliance upon tendency evidence) that the accused acted from anger or in retaliation in stabbing the deceased with some scepticism.
	
	
	The accused argues that it is important that, when considering the evidence of these prior representations by the deceased as to violence meted out to him by the accused, the jury have information relevant to the deceased’s credibility.
	
	
	The accused referred the Court to a number of authorities in support of her argument.
	


R v Aldridge (1990) 20 NSWLR 737


	
	The appellant, Raymond Edward Alridge was charged with shooting at the victim with intent to murder and, in the alternative, with maliciously shooting at the victim with intent to do grievous bodily harm. In this matter there were diametrically opposed versions of what occurred between the Crown and a witness. The trial judge did not allow the cross-examination of the victim as to his criminal record, mostly of which involved petty crime from many years before when the witness was a juvenile.
	
	
	In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt J referred to the judgment of Dixon J in Bugg v Day (1949) 79 CLR 442, in a case which concerned the admissibility upon the issue of credit of the defendant’s previous traffic offences. I preface that his Honour’s restriction was not supported in the judgments of other members of the court.
	
	
	It was held that convictions for any offences (even for offences which do not themselves involve any question of dishonesty) are admissible in relation to credit, upon the basis that a conviction for any offence against the law may have some effect upon the credit of the witness. (741F)
	


R v Burns [2003] NSWCCA 30


	
	Mr Burns was convicted of armed robbery with an offensive weapon. Two witnesses, AK and SB, were called by the Crown to give evidence of admissions Mr Burns allegedly made to them after the robbery. Mr Burns appealed to the CCA complaining, among other things, of the trial judge’s refusal to allow cross-examination of the two witnesses as to the criminal history of each for offences of dishonesty.
	
	
	Having set out the evidence relevant to the admissions made to AK, Sully J, with whom Buddin J and Hodgson JA agreed, found that there was no error in refusal to allow cross-examination of AK on her criminal history, as her reliability had already been substantially undermined by other evidence.
	
	
	The court was not unanimous with respect to SB. While Sully J reached a similar conclusion with respect to SB, Buddin J and Hodgson JA took a different view concluding that the jury may have taken a different view of SB’s evidence had they been aware of his convictions. Their Honours found that SB was an important witness in the Crown case. Evidence of his criminal conviction for offences of dishonesty had substantial probative value and was “capable of affecting the assessment, in important respects, of his credibility.” ([102])
	


R v Lumsden [2003] NSWCCA 83


	
	Ms Lumsden was convicted of an offence of ongoing supply, namely supplying methylamphetamine on three separate occasions within a period of thirty consecutive days. The supplies were made either directly or through a third party to an undercover police officer.
	
	
	Ms Lumsden called alibi evidence from a number of witnesses, the practical effect of which, if accepted, was that she was elsewhere at the time of one of the three supplies, and thus could not have committed the offence. One of these witnesses, Mr Thurtell, volunteered in the witness box that he had served a sentence of imprisonment for offences of supplying a prohibited drug and having goods in custody.
	
	
	One of the grounds of appeal was that Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination of Mr Thurtell breached the credibility rule in s.102 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	This ground was rejected by the majority. Hulme J, with whom Mason P agreed, found that the evidence had substantial probative value and was admissible under s.103 of the Evidence Act because Mr Thurtell’s credibility and reliability were important factors in the case, and knowledge of his prior convictions was very relevant to an assessment of whether he could be relied upon to tell the truth.
	
	
	The authorities relate to the credibility of witnesses who were called to give evidence on oath or affirmation at trial. Despite that difference, the principles remain applicable, having regard to the terms of s.101A (which refers to credibility evidence relating to “a witness or other person” (emphasis added)), coupled with the terms of s.108A.
	


Determination


	
	Having considered the words used in the statute, such authority as there is, and the nature of the evidence already adduced and sought to be adduced, it is my view that credibility evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the deceased’s credibility. This may be a critical issue on the question of whether the accused acted in self-defence having regard to the reliability or otherwise of the complaints the deceased had previously made to others about acts of violence he was subjected to at the accused’s hands.
	
	
	It is likely that the Crown will ask the jury to have regard to those complaints when considering the question of proof of the final element of a charge of murder, that the deliberate act causing death was one done without lawful excuse.
	
	
	Evidence that could establish that the deceased had acted dishonestly in the past is directly relevant to that issue, and may have significant probative value. Whether it has such value is a matter for the jury, but its capacity to do so means that the evidence should be admitted.
	
	
	The test at s.108A has been satisfied.

		07 August 2015",2015-07-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703034,“B” v Reineker [2015] NSWSC 949,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By statement of claim filed in the District Court on 29 November 2010, the plaintiff, “B”, commenced proceedings for damages for trespass against Darryl Reineker (the defendant) and for negligence against Moree Christian Community School (the School). Her claims arise out of events that occurred in the period from 1 August 2001 until 2008. Mr Reineker, who was employed by the School, was the plaintiff’s teacher between 2001 and September 2003.
	
	
	B’s claim against the School was resolved by agreement. On 13 July 2015, the first day of the hearing, I granted leave to the plaintiff to file a notice of discontinuance against the School with no order as to costs. I was not privy to any other terms of the resolution between them.
	
	
	B pressed her claim for damages against Mr Reineker. The principal allegation against Mr Reineker was:
	


“Between 2001 and 2008 the Plaintiff was sexually assaulted by the First Defendant during the course of his employment with the Second Defendant and on occasions independent of that employment.”


	
	On 2 February 2001 Mr Reineker filed a defence to the original statement of claim in the District Court in which he denied the allegation set out above. At that time his solicitor was Horst Merten of Mertens.
	
	
	The defendant did not rely on the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) in his defence and has not at any time filed a defence in which he has pleaded the Limitation Act. Had he intended to rely on it, he was obliged to plead it: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 14.14(2) and (3). Accordingly, it can be assumed that he intended to waive it: Australian Iron & Steel Ltd v Hoogland (1962) 108 CLR 471 at 488 per Windeyer J.
	
	
	The defendant was subsequently charged with two counts of aggravated indecent assault of the plaintiff (who was respectively 14 and 15 years of age at the time) contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and four counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with the plaintiff (three of which occurred when she was 14 and the fourth when she was 15) contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act. He pleaded guilty to these offences and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. At the time of hearing he was still in custody, serving his sentence.
	
	
	By email dated 6 March 2014 the defendant’s solicitors informed the other parties that Mr Reineker had instructed them that he would not be participating further in the proceedings and that they had been instructed to cease to act. On 13 July 2015, the plaintiff established that Mr Reineker had been notified of the hearing date and had been served with the evidence and amended pleadings. Accordingly, the matter proceeded on 13 July 2015 against the defendant as an undefended matter.
	
	
	The allegation against the defendant set out above was not amended in further iterations of the statement of claim. The particulars of the allegation of sexual assault were as follows:
	


(i)   Between 1 August 2001 and 5 September 2003 multiple counts of indecent assault on the Plaintiff in and about the school known as Moree Christian Community School which was at all material times in the control of the second defendant.

(ii)   Between 1 August 2001 and 5 September 2003 one incident of indecent assault on the Plaintiff when the First Defendant was driving the Plaintiff to a swimming event in which she was participating as a pupil of the Second Defendant.

(iii)   Between 1 February 2002 and 5 September 2003 multiple incidents of indecent assault and sexual assault on the Plaintiff in and around the Agricultural Shed which was situated in the grounds of the school which was at all material times in the control of the second defendant.

(iv)   Between 1 August 2001 and 5 September 2003 multiple counts of sexual assault on the Plaintiff in and about the school known as Moree Christian Community School which was at all material times in the control of the second defendant.

(v)   Between 23 June 2003 and 29 June 2003 a sexual assault of the Plaintiff while she was a minor at Kyogle.

(vi)   Between 1 December 2007 and 30 December 2008 at least three sexual assaults of the Plaintiff at Port Macquarie.

The Facts


	
	The plaintiff was born in October 1987. When she was about five years old, she moved with her family to Moree. In 2000, when the plaintiff was 12 years old, she was enrolled in Year 7 at the School. At the end of the year, she met the defendant at the Four Square Calvary Christian Church, where she attended with her family. The defendant, a single parent, went to the same church with his two sons, one of whom was two years older than the plaintiff and the other, two years younger. The defendant befriended the plaintiff’s parents.
	
	
	In 2001, the defendant was engaged by the School as a teacher. He taught various classes, including the plaintiff’s Year 8 class, and various subjects, including mathematics, design and technology and physical education. He was also the sports teacher for the whole school. It was not long before the defendant started training the plaintiff and one of his own sons in athletics after school.
	
	
	The plaintiff was having difficulty with mathematics. The defendant offered to tutor her after school, which gave him access to her in a private setting. He used the opportunity to touch her inappropriately. He began by putting his hand up her skirt and touching her vagina. The plaintiff felt uncomfortable but did not report it for fear that she would get into trouble.
	
	
	By about September 2001, the defendant also began coaching the plaintiff and one of his sons at the local swimming pool. The defendant would compliment the plaintiff on the shape of her body and, on one occasion, he asked her to remove her swimming costume in front of him. She refused his initial request. Later, when the defendant brought her to his home after training, she agreed to remove her swimming costume to permit him to massage her back as she had lumbar pain from athletics training. As he massaged her back, her bottom and her breasts, she became aware of his erect penis. She said of this incident:
	


“At the time I thought the way I was feeling was my fault and Darryl wasn’t doing anything wrong. I didn’t want to upset Darryl. I thought that because Darryl was my school teacher and swim coach, and he was an adult that he wouldn’t be doing the wrong thing. I trusted him.”


	
	As the days passed and the massages continued the plaintiff became accustomed to them and became less embarrassed by them.
	
	
	In 2002, when the plaintiff was in Year 9, the defendant began to teach agriculture to her class. There was a shed on the school grounds, known as the “Ag shed” in which plants and equipment were stored. After school, the defendant invited the plaintiff into the Ag shed. He shut all the doors so that no one could see them. When he was inside the Ag shed with the plaintiff, the defendant kissed her, made her touch his penis.
	
	
	On one occasion the defendant asked the plaintiff to kiss him. He kissed her on the lips and put his tongue in her mouth. The kiss continued for 10 to 15 seconds. This was the first time the plaintiff had ever experienced such a kiss.
	
	
	Over time the defendant’s behavior towards the plaintiff became more intrusive. When he massaged her he inserted his finger into her vagina. Later, just before she turned 14, he inserted his penis into her vagina. The act of penetration hurt her so much that she screamed in pain. He withdrew before ejaculation and then masturbated himself to ejaculation. Her uncontroverted evidence about this incident was:
	


“I remember asking myself if what Darryl had done was sex. I didn’t even know that it was sex at the time. I promised myself that it wasn’t and that I wouldn’t tell anyone and I would pretend it didn’t happen. I was also very upset because my parents had raised me as a Christian and I believed I was to have sex after marriage. I thought that if I had just had sex with Darryl I would get in trouble. It made me feel guilty.”


	
	After this first occasion of penile intercourse, the defendant had sexual intercourse with the plaintiff regularly after school and on the weekends. She felt that she had no way of breaking the routine. In her uncontroverted evidence, the plaintiff explained that she had a poor relationship with her own father and regarded the defendant as showing her the love and affection she wanted, but did not receive, from her own father. The defendant told her that he wished she was his real daughter and encouraged her to call him “Dad”. The plaintiff complied as she wanted the defendant to love her as a father would. At times, the defendant would threaten to kill himself if she did not do as he wished.
	
	
	On the plaintiff’s 15th birthday, in October 2002, the defendant visited her at home. He took her into the bathroom and told her to kneel down on the floor. He approached the plaintiff from behind and inserted his erect penis into her vagina, then withdrew and ejaculated into his hands. He then said, “Happy Birthday”.
	
	
	In June 2003 the defendant took students from the School, including the plaintiff, to an Outward Bound excursion. The defendant sat next to the plaintiff on the bus, put a coat over their laps and fondled the plaintiff during the journey.
	
	
	As the intimacy between the defendant and the plaintiff increased, the plaintiff became more and more isolated from her contemporaries. She became depressed. She cut her arms and legs. She still bears a scar on her forearm from one of the more serious cuts she inflicted on herself. She withdrew from her family. She divided her time between school; being with the defendant at his place; and confining herself to her own bedroom when at home. She stopped playing sports. She felt trapped and believed that there was no one to whom she could turn.
	
	
	In September 2003 the defendant resigned from his position at the School. The plaintiff transferred to another school in the area where she remained for a single semester before leaving Moree for Sydney in June 2004. She lived with her brother for a few months but was required to leave because of conflict with her brother’s girlfriend. She sought refuge with the defendant. Her parents, who were not aware that the defendant was sexually assaulting her, agreed to this living arrangement.
	
	
	In April 2005 the plaintiff became pregnant. The defendant threatened to kill himself if she did not terminate the pregnancy. The defendant arranged for the termination which was carried out at the Moree District Hospital on 11 May 2005. Investigations revealed that the pregnancy had ended prior to the termination. The defendant arranged for the plaintiff to go on the contraceptive pill thereafter. In December 2005, the plaintiff had an ultrasound that showed that she was again pregnant. A further ultrasound identified a “blighted ovum”, which was removed by a dilation and curettage which was performed on 21 December 2005.
	
	
	I note that the particulars of the assaults relied upon (set out above) do not include the events of 2005. Nonetheless the plaintiff was directed to file and serve statements and other evidence on which she relied. Her statements and the evidence served established the narrative of what occurred in 2005. The hospital records associated with both pregnancies were also served. Had the defendant taken part in the proceedings he would have appreciated that the plaintiff intended to rely on these events in her claim against him and could, if he had seen fit, have objected to the evidence on the ground that it fell outside the particulars. It is difficult to see how, in those circumstances, he could have resisted the expansion of the particulars or the admission of the evidence. Moreover, these assaults fall within the period alleged in the pleadings. A failure to amend particulars to correspond exactly with the facts established by the evidence does not preclude reliance on such facts, particularly where they fall within the pleaded case: Dare v Pulham (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664. In these circumstances, I have had regard to the evidence of the events in 2005 and taken it into account on liability and in the assessment of damages.
	
	
	When the plaintiff was 19, she moved from the defendant’s house to Armidale to do Year 12 at TAFE. The defendant visited her and continued to have sexual intercourse with her. The last occasion on which the defendant had sexual intercourse with the plaintiff was in 2008 at Christmas time.
	


The aftermath


	
	In March 2009 the plaintiff attended a talk conducted by Patrick Moore, a motivational speaker. Afterwards the plaintiff contacted Mr Moore and told him what the defendant had done to her. As a result of Mr Moore’s encouragement, the plaintiff told her mother and sister what had happened with the defendant. She also rang the defendant and told him that she did not want to see him again. Her contact with the defendant caused her great distress.
	
	
	In April 2009 the plaintiff sought medical assistance for her mental state. Her general practitioner, Dr Rajalingham, diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and recommended that she see a psychologist and report the matter to the police. In July 2009, the plaintiff went to see Wendy Oxley, a clinical psychologist at Port Macquarie, and was treated for the depression.
	
	
	In August or September 2009 the plaintiff met Sean Lyons, who became her boyfriend. At that time the plaintiff was still in contact with the defendant. According to Mr Lyons’ uncontroverted evidence the plaintiff and the defendant would talk for a long time on the phone. Mr Lyons often heard the plaintiff call the defendant “Dad”.
	
	
	In October 2009 the plaintiff gave a detailed statement to police at Port Macquarie Police Station in which she set out the events referred to above.
	
	
	The plaintiff lived with Mr Lyons for the first three months of 2010 at Mr Lyons’ home in Wauchope. During that period the plaintiff was violent towards Mr Lyons, who believed that her conduct was as the result of her anguish at what the defendant had done to her. Mr Lyons’ evidence was:
	


“The more [the plaintiff] talked about [the defendant] the more she went downhill. She would have really high highs and really low lows. She would be really angry one minute and in tears the next. [The plaintiff] suffers from serious anxiety issues. She would have sleepless nights. I would find her wandering around the house at all hours of the night. In the end, she had to find somewhere else to live.”


	
	On 19 March 2010 Mr Lyons accompanied the plaintiff to the offices of Priest McCarron, solicitors, in Port Macquarie. She lodged a claim for victim’s compensation in respect of the defendant’s conduct.
	
	
	On 2 May 2010 the plaintiff rang the defendant. I infer from the form of the transcript that the telephone call was recorded by police pursuant to a warrant. The plaintiff denounced the defendant for sexually assaulting her when she was underage. She asked him to turn himself in. The defendant admitted the conduct in broad terms. He expressed concern about the effect on his own sons if he were to turn himself in. He intimated that he would kill himself. He also made the following statements in the course of the recorded conversation:
	


“What I did to you was unbelievably wrong. I have no answers for it. I have no idea what I did, why I did it.”

“No, no, I did the wrong thing. You’ve made that clear and I know I’ve done the wrong thing. Don’t worry. You know, I’ve, I didn’t want this to happen with you. I can guarantee you that. I actually really really enjoyed your company and your, actually, your father’s company. But that’s irrelevant. And every time we used to do this sort of thing, we used, yep, it was, I knew it was wrong, but I just, I don’t know, I, like I say, I’m not making excuses, I’m over it. It has never happened. I’ve never looked at another young girl that way in my whole life. And I never would. I don’t know what has happened. But once is too much and thanks for waking me up to that. And I really think I was, I don’t know I just, I’ve got so much on my plate. But, anyway, I’ll do that, I’ll give you a call around Thursday, if that’s OK.”


	
	In February 2013 the plaintiff met “J” at the Coastside Church at Port Macquarie. They did not have sexual intercourse or live together before they were married. Although the plaintiff disclosed to J in broad terms what the defendant had done to her, J had no idea either of the detail, or the effects on the plaintiff, of the defendant’s conduct, until they married in May 2013.
	
	
	J’s uncontroverted evidence is that the plaintiff sometimes calls him “Daddy” and reverts to the mindset and behavior of a three-year old. She is upset by small things and flies into a rage. On such occasions she regresses to child-like conduct. The plaintiff told Dr Parsonage, a medicolegal psychiatrist whom she consulted for the purposes of the proceedings, that on one occasion she had cut up most of her husband’s clothes. J’s evidence was that he tends to work hard to enable him to deal with and manage the stresses of the plaintiff’s mental state.
	
	
	J’s uncontroverted evidence is that the plaintiff suffers from the following problems:
	


“a. She has a hysterical inability to cope with minor incidents and changes.

b. She is very sensory and has issues with tactile contact, especially when she is in one of her episodes where she is having trouble coping.

c. She is easily startled by loud noises such as our dogs barking.

d. She has fits of anger that lead to violent outburst. In the two years that we have been married, she has broken two television sets, three computers, two PlayStations and mobile phones. She is very upset after these episodes, which usually last from 30 minutes to an hour.

e. She keep[s] herself very busy until something goes wrong and triggers an episode. These episodes are sometimes two or three times per day. There is the occasional day where she would not have an episode.

f. On the day of making this statement, 30 April 2015, [the plaintiff] was unable to get out of bed because it was raining. She didn’t have a raincoat and this triggered an episode where she was unable to go to work.

g. A couple of times each month [the plaintiff] has episodes where she will be unable to attend work. She will telephone the office of the hospital where [she] works and she says she cannot come in because she is sick. I suspect that they have some idea that she has some issues.

h. Things like her car being parked in or having difficulty getting the car out of a parking position result in her crying on the telephone to me.

i. [The plaintiff] cannot cope with change to an extent that the same dvd must be played on our tv all day and night even if we are not home.”


	
	J described in his evidence the plaintiff’s capacity to present herself in three distinct ways: first, the state she is in when with her family where she appears to be happy; secondly, her professional state where she presents in a very controlled manner; and thirdly, her “at home” state where she lets her defences down and becomes hysterical at the slightest trigger, including any disruption to her routine. J’s evidence is that the plaintiff has two “therapy” dogs which provide her with comfort and support and appear to increase her ability to cope. The first was purchased on the recommendation of one of the plaintiff’s treating medical practitioners.
	
	
	In February 2014 the plaintiff and her husband moved to Sydney. She obtained employment at a hospital in the Sydney metropolitan area as an assistant in nursing where she has worked full-time since 28 July 2014. Her contract continues for two-years. J obtained employment in his chosen field as a sound engineer.
	
	
	On 21 February 2014 the plaintiff prepared a victim impact statement which she read out in Court at the sentence hearing in respect of the defendant. In the statement, the plaintiff described the effects of the defendant’s conduct on her. The evidence established that she has been hospitalized at least three times as a result of her attempts to commit suicide: the first on 26 November 2010; the second on 12 December 2010 and on 15 December 2010; and the third on 2 February 2011. On another occasion, in April 2011, she presented herself at Accident & Emergency at Port Macquarie Base Hospital for treatment after she had overdosed.
	
	
	Her victim impact statement included the following:
	


“I suffer from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), depression, anxiety, flash backs and anger. My flash backs don’t allow me to sleep through the night. I have reoccurring nightmares that continually wake me up completely soaked through clothing and my bedding. Being an angry person has effected [sic] every single relationship I have ever had, especially loved ones. Suffering from PTSD, depression and anxiety effects me [sic] on a daily basis, its [sic] hard for me to gain employment and when I do I am unable to work full time because of all the physical side affect [sic] I have to deal with.

A child is shaped and moulded by the actions of people that surround them and their environment. Because I grew up in a sexually abusive relationship with a person that held authority in my life. It has completely altered my way of thinking and way of life. How you think affects the way you feel, how you feel affects what what [sic] actions you take. The sexual abuse has created false and negative thinking patterns in my life, it has cause[d] me to feel only negative feelings, creating negative actions.”


	
	Since January 2015 the plaintiff has attended Lynne Tull, a psychologist, weekly.
	


Expert evidence

Dr Natalie Green


	
	The plaintiff was referred to Dr Natalie Green for the purposes of assessment of her functioning capacity which was conducted on 18 May 2010. The findings on psychometric assessment indicated that she was suffering from substantial distress and severe impairment in functioning.
	
	
	In September 2011 the plaintiff was assessed by Alison O’Neill, psychologist, who summarized the results of psychometric testing as follows:
	


“In sum, psychometric testing with [the plaintiff] suggests that she is a young woman of at least average intelligence, who has marked dysfunction in her personality characteristics. She was found to be someone who is chronically socially avoidant, emotionally detached and passive in her interactions with others. Such dysfunction undoubtedly impacts her day to day functioning. Moreover, her profile indicates she is experiencing clinical levels of anxiety, and specifically post traumatic stress, as well as depressive symptoms. These findings were consistent with [the plaintiff’s] presentation and the history provided.”


	
	Ms O’Neill considered that the plaintiff’s exposure to “innumerable acts of sexual abuse over a period of nearly ten years by a trusted member of the community who took on a father figure role” had resulted in the following long term effects: depression, self-destructive behavior, anxiety, feelings of isolation and stigma, poor self-esteem, difficulty trusting others and sexual maladjustment.
	
	
	The plaintiff has been assessed for the purposes of these proceedings by Dr Parsonage, a psychiatrist, at Port Macquarie. Following the first assessment on 20 October 2011, Dr Parsonage diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. He opined that her ability to form mature intimate relationships has been “severely impaired”. Although he considered that her disabilities would continue “indefinitely”, he opined that her symptoms would improve with treatment in the next few years, although complete remission was unlikely. Dr Parsonage said that her anxiety about dealing with the public, and with men in particular, would be likely to compromise substantially her capacity to work in many occupations.
	
	
	In his report dated 21 May 2013 Dr Parsonage addressed the question of the plaintiff’s mental capacity. He opined that she was a “disabled person” within the definition in s 11(3)(b)(i) of the Limitation Act until at least 2009. In other words, Dr Parsonage considered the plaintiff to have been relevantly incapable of, or substantially impeded in, managing her affairs in relation to the cause of action in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises, by reason of an impairment of her mental condition. I infer that this report was prepared to support the plaintiff’s application for extension of time against the School. Nonetheless, Dr Parsonage’s opinion is relevant to an assessment of the circumstances in which the torts were committed. Dr Parsonage explained that:
	


“Her [the plaintiff’s] relationship with Mr Reineker after she was 18 was severely distorted by the long term abuse she had experienced from Mr Reineker. While she was living with Mr Reineker she called him “Daddy” and introduced him to other people as her father. He treated her like a child in that she had chores to do and he cooked her meals, but at night he would try to have sex with her.”


	
	In his report dated 10 June 2014 Dr Parsonage noted that the plaintiff was seeing Ms Tull weekly and that she was taking Pristiq (an anti-depressant) and Valium. His diagnosis at the time of the report was as follows:
	


“[The plaintiff] continues to be affected by the abuse she experienced which has affected her personality development. She exhibits some borderline personality traits including unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, recurrent self-harm, affective instability, as well as inappropriate intense anger. She continues to exhibit a full syndrome of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder which is currently in partial remission.”


	
	Dr Parsonage considered the plaintiff to require long-term psychiatric and psychological treatment arising from the defendant’s abuse. He estimated that she would require weekly psychological therapy for a period of two years at a cost of $200 per session, and further therapy less frequently thereafter. Dr Parsonage considered that her medication ought be reviewed and supervised by a psychiatrist and that she would require 10 psychiatric consultations at a cost of $300 per consultation.
	


Liability


	
	The plaintiff has established her cause of action in trespass against the defendant. I accept her uncontroverted evidence of the assaults which he committed on her during the period 2001 to 2008. The plaintiff was below the age of consent (16) for a large proportion of the assaults. Consent is a defence to assault. The onus of proving it lies on the defendant. The defendant has neither alleged nor proved consent. However, as he did not appear at the hearing, I propose to address the question in light of the plaintiff’s evidence.
	
	
	The evidence established that while the plaintiff was still a minor and a pupil in the defendant’s class, he abused his position of trust and authority. He groomed her and then exploited and corrupted her for his own sexual needs and desires. In these circumstances I consider that it would be unreal to regard her as being able to form a judgment in her own interests whether to consent to his advances merely because she had reached the biological marker that legally corresponded with adulthood. Indeed, I consider that the effect of his prior conduct was to deprive her of the power to object, in any substantial way, to his assaults on her. She was, in my view, doing no more than submitting to his acts in circumstances where he had deprived her of the ability to resist.
	


Damages


	
	As the tort of trespass is an intentional tort, the Civil Liability Act 2005 (NSW) does not relevantly apply. Accordingly damages are to be assessed by reference to the common law.
	


General damages


	
	The plaintiff claimed general damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages. Mr Lakeman, who appeared with Ms Webb for the plaintiff, submitted that $350,000 was an appropriate figure for general damages whether or not I considered that exemplary damages or aggravated damages ought be included.
	


Whether aggravated damages ought be awarded


	
	Where the tort in respect of which general damages are to be awarded is trespass and the nature of the trespass is sexual assault, it appears to me to be inevitable that the circumstances and manner of the wrongdoing give rise to substantial hurt and damage. It is not necessary in these circumstances to identify separately any award for aggravated damages since this element is part of the general damages.
	


Whether exemplary damages can be awarded


	
	There can be little doubt that the defendant’s conduct meets the description required for an award of exemplary damages of “conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of another’s rights”: Whitfield v De Lauret & Co. Ltd (1920) 29 CLR 71 at 77 per Knox CJ, referred to with approval in Gray v Motor Accident Commission [1998] HCA 70; 196 CLR 1 at [14]. However, it is not appropriate in the present case to award exemplary damages against the defendant. Exemplary damages extend beyond compensation and are intended to fulfill the purposes of punishment, denunciation and deterrence. These are the very purposes served by the imposition of a sentence on an offender: s 3A(a), (b), (e) and (f), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The defendant has been convicted of six offences which include the conduct that constituted the trespass to the plaintiff, on which her claim in the present case is founded. He is presently serving a term of imprisonment for those crimes. This amounts, in my view, to substantial punishment which operates as a bar to an award of exemplary damages: Gray v Motor Accident Commission at [40] for the reasons given at [41] - [46].
	


Award for general damages


	
	I consider the figure of $350,000 proposed by Mr Lakeman to be an appropriate award. The plaintiff has suffered substantial harm. She has been deprived of a normal adolescence and the opportunity to discover and enjoy sex in an appropriate way. Her willingness and ability to trust others, as well as her capacity to form intimate relationships, have been substantially compromised by the defendant’s wrongdoing. The defendant’s conduct blighted her past and will continue to affect her future. Although it is to be hoped that treatment will ameliorate some of the effects of the assaults, the plaintiff will suffer by reason of the defendant’s conduct for the rest of her life.
	
	
	Of the total figure of $350,000, I allocate $200,000 to the past and $150,000 for the future. The plaintiff is entitled to interest on the component for the past. The applicable rate is 4%: MBP (SA) Pty Ltd v Gogic [1991] HCA 3; 171 CLR 657. I consider it to be reasonable to regard the pain and suffering for the past as having been sustained for the whole of the period from the time of the first assault relied upon. The precise timing of this event is not revealed by the evidence. However, as the first act of penile/ vaginal intercourse took place before the plaintiff’s 14th birthday I propose to allow interest from July 2001 to the present day, a period of 14 years (calculated as $200,000 x 14 x 4% x ½ (to take account of the whole period)). Accordingly the award for general damages is the rounded figure of $410,000, being $350,000 plus $56,000 for interest.
	


Out of pocket expenses

Past out of pocket expenses


	
	I assess an amount for past out-of-pocket expenses as a rounded amount of $33,000. This sum comprises the following amounts. The amount for past medical expenses (which is to be repaid to Medicare) is $15,351.65. The sum of $12,580 claimed is referable to consultations with Ms Tull. I allow $5,000 for pharmaceutical medication. The actual amounts spent on pharmaceutical medication are not established precisely by the evidence. The amount awarded is $10 per week for 500 weeks.
	
	
	The evidence is that the plaintiff has had first one and then a second therapy dog. I regard the cost of a single dog as being reasonable. The evidence is that the weekly cost of a dog is $200 per week. The evidence does not reveal how that sum is comprised or for what period the plaintiff has had each dog. In these circumstances I make no allowance for the past cost of a dog or dogs.
	
	
	There is evidence that the plaintiff trains at a gym with a trainer (at a cost of $170 per fortnight). I accept that this is beneficial for her mental health. However, the evidence does not establish what has been spent in the past on a trainer and accordingly I make no award for the past requirement of a trainer.
	


Future out of pocket expenses


	
	I accept Dr Parsonage’s opinion as to the further treatment required. I propose to allow $200 per week for psychological treatment for the next two years. Using the 3% tables the multiplier is 101.3 and gives rise to a figure of $20,260. Thereafter I allow an amount of $50,000 for the balance of the future since I accept Dr Parsonage’s opinion that fewer consultations will be required in the future after the initial period of two years of intensive therapy.
	
	
	I allow for two psychiatric consultations per year at a cost of $300 per consultation ($11.50 per week) for the rest of the plaintiff’s life. I accept Dr Parsonage’s opinion that these consultations are reasonably necessary to review her condition and monitor any medication she might be taking for depression and anxiety. This gives rise to a rounded allowance of $17,000, being $11.50 x 1,474.4 (the 3% multiplier for the plaintiff’s life expectancy of 61 years remaining).
	
	
	Although Dr Parsonage does not address the need for consultations with a general practitioner, the plaintiff’s evidence is that she sees her general practitioner once a month for prescription medication at a cost of $70 per month. Having regard to the psychiatric review referred to above, I consider it reasonable to allow for four visits annually to the plaintiff’s general practitioner at an annual cost of $280, or a weekly cost of $5.30. This gives rise to a rounded allowance of $7,800, being $5.30 x 1,474.4 (the 3% multiplier for the plaintiff’s life expectancy of 61 years remaining).
	
	
	The weekly cost of a gym instructor is $85. I propose to allow this cost for the next five years in order to assist the plaintiff for the purpose of developing new habits and to assist in whatever rehabilitation is possible. I do not consider it to be reasonable to allow this amount beyond that period. Accordingly, I allow $20,600, being $85 x 242.6 (the 3% multiplier for five years).
	
	
	The claimed weekly cost of a dog at $200 is not substantiated, except in broad terms in the plaintiff’s evidence. I do not accept, without such substantiation, that it is a reasonable cost, although I accept that the provision of a dog is reasonable. I allow $100,000 for the cost of a dog, which equates in broad terms to $100 per week for the rest of the plaintiff’s life with a discount to take account of the possibility that the plaintiff would have had a dog anyway or that she will live in accommodation where it is not possible to have a dog.
	
	
	Accordingly, the award for future out-of-pocket expenses is the rounded figure of $215,000, less 15% discount for vicissitudes, resulting in a rounded award of $183,000.
	


Damages for loss of earning capacity

Past loss of earning capacity


	
	I accept that the plaintiff’s capacity to earn has been affected by the depression and post-traumatic stress disorder that she has suffered as a result of the defendant’s trespass. Mr Lakeman submitted that it would be reasonable to calculate her loss for the past and the future by compensating her for the disparity between what she actually earned and average weekly earnings (AWE) for females in New South Wales. Although this is a somewhat crude measure, I accept that it is generally appropriate in the circumstances of this case to assess damages in this way. No greater precision is possible in circumstances where the torts were committed when the plaintiff was relatively young and before her uninjured potential was revealed.
	
	
	However, I do not accept that the plaintiff would, but for the defendant’s wrongdoing, have worked full-time from the age of 17. I consider that her damages for loss of earning capacity ought be assessed on the footing that she would have begun working from the beginning of 2006, being the commencement of the first calendar year following her 18th birthday.
	
	
	For the period when the plaintiff was aged 18 to 25 (350 weeks, rounded) I have used an average of the Total Earnings for All Females in New South Wales, being $690 net per week. I consider it to be reasonable to allow a lower figure for the period from the age of 18 to 25, to make allowance for the probability of her undertaking further education during this period. For the remaining 150 weeks (from age 25 to the present) I have used the Ordinary Time Earnings for Full-Time Adults (Female Employees) in New South Wales ($880 net per week).
	
	
	Her total net earnings for the period but for the defendant’s tort would, accordingly, have been in the order of $375,000 (rounded).
	
	
	The plaintiff has tendered evidence as to her income since the 2006/2007 financial year. The income she has received includes Australian Government allowances. The evidence does not establish the precise nature of these allowances or whether the plaintiff will be required to repay them from any damages she receives as a result of the judgment in her favour.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s actual earnings (excluding government allowances) during this period have been in the order of $50,000, giving rise to a net figure for loss of earning capacity in the order of $325,000.
	
	
	The plaintiff is entitled to interest on past economic loss. I accept Mr Lakeman’s submission that an appropriate average rate is 7.625% and that it would be reasonable to apply half that rate (3.81%) to the whole past figure to take account of the interest requirement. For a period of nine and half years, I make an award for interest on damages for past economic loss of $117,000.
	


Future loss of earning capacity


	
	There are substantial difficulties in the present case in assessing damages for future loss of earning capacity. On the one hand, the plaintiff has shown herself, since she obtained employment as a nurses’ aide, to be a capable worker who is able to perform a relatively demanding job notwithstanding her considerable psychological difficulties. Her husband attested to her capacity to put on a professional front in such circumstances. Moreover, the expert medical evidence is that she is likely to improve with a sustained period of psychological treatment and that such improvement will be assisted by the conclusion of these proceedings. However, the psychological difficulties caused by the defendant’s wrongdoing are likely to be intractable. For this reason it cannot be inferred that the plaintiff will ever fully regain her lost potential.
	
	
	Mr Lakeman proposed that damages for future loss of earning capacity ought be assessed on the basis that the plaintiff will be able to work in a job such as the one in which she is presently employed into the future. I accept that this is a reasonable measure. Accordingly the award for future economic loss is the difference between $880 net per week (being the “Ordinary Time” AWE for females in NSW) and $687 net per week (being the plaintiff’s earnings in her present employment) until the plaintiff is 65 (using the 3% multiplier of 1191.2). I have allowed a greater discount for vicissitudes, 30%, to take account of other factors, including that she would have had time off for children (and may well still do if she has them) since I consider that it would be unlikely that she will, or would have, worked continuously to the age of 65. The discount for vicissitudes also takes account of the possibility that the treatment will enable her to obtain a position in which her income is higher. The award for future economic loss is the rounded figure of $160,000.
	


Summary of damages


	
	In summary I assess the plaintiff’s damages as $1,228,000, as set out in the following table:
	



	
		
			
			General damages
			
			
			$350,000
			
		
		
			
			Interest on past general damages ($200,000 x 14 years x 4% x ½)
			
			
			$60,000
			
		
		
			
			Past out of pocket expenses
			
			
			$33,000
			
		
		
			
			Future out of pocket expenses
			
			
			$183,000
			
		
		
			
			Past loss of earning capacity
			
			
			$325,000
			
		
		
			
			Interest on past loss of earning capacity ($325,000 x 9 ½ years x 3.81%)
			
			
			$117,000
			
		
		
			
			Future loss of earning capacity
			
			
			$160,000
			
		
		
			
			TOTAL
			
			
			$1,228,000

		20 July 2015",2015-07-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703042,Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Inspector Raymond Welsh (No 3) [2015] NSWIC 8,"Judgment


	
	In this matter Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd (“Tanwar” or “appellant”) has sought to appeal from a decision of her Honour Acting Chief Industrial Magistrate Goodwin (“the CIM”) given on 27 June 2014. The decision was in respect of a prosecution against Tanwar by New South Wales Industrial Relations (“respondent” or “the prosecutor”), under s 357 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (“IR Act”) for failing to pay a taxi driver, Mr Ranjeev Kumar, entitlements in accordance with the Taxi Industry (Contract Drivers) Determination 1984 (“the Determination”). The appeal was brought under s 197(1) of the IR Act.
	
	
	The matter was heard by her Honour at first instance over three days. The CIM found that Tanwar failed to comply with a provision of an industrial instrument. The CIM imposed a civil penalty and ordered the appellant to pay Mr Kumar an amount in respect of annual leave.
	


Background


	
	Tanwar operated a taxi service. As at 2009, its base of operations was located at 281 New Canterbury Road, Lewisham. The base contained a service station, office and workshop. The appellant operated 13 taxis.
	
	
	Mr Kumar commenced as a bailee taxi driver with the appellant in January 2009, with his last shift in June 2009. As will be seen, those dates are significant.
	
	
	For the purposes of the bailment, Mr Kumar paid a set amount, referred to as a pay-in, to ‘hire’ a taxi under Method 2 of the Determination. Method 2, is prescribed in cl 3 of the Determination, which, so far as relevant, reads:
	


Method II – Set Pay-in

(a) A bailee shall be entitled to receive and retain from the chargeable fares, the balance left after deducting the amounts set out in Table 1 – Wages of Part B, Monetary rates, of this determination.

(b) A bailor and bailee may agree on lesser amounts than those specified in Table 1 – Wages, of Part B, Monetary Rates, of this determination, provided that such an agreement shall not operate to relieve the bailor of the obligation to comply with any requirement of this determination.


	
	Under cl 19(b)(ll) of the Determination Mr Kumar was entitled to be paid an amount in respect of accumulated annual leave at the conclusion of the bailment.
	
	
	It was alleged that Tanwar had failed to comply with its obligations to pay Mr Kumar the sum due. That amount was $1,476.53.
	
	
	It is not disputed that the appellant was a bailor for the purposes of the Determination, or that it was bound to conform to the provisions of the Determination. At trial it was not disputed that the respondent was a permanent bailee. The appellant sought to raise that issue in the appeal. It was not permitted to do so; see Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v New South Wales Industrial Relations (No 2) [2015] NSWIC 5 (“Tanwar No 2”).
	
	
	By a court attendance notice issued 13 June 2013, the prosecutor, Raymond Welsh, an Industrial Inspector with NSW Industrial Relations, commenced proceedings in the Chief Industrial Magistrates Court against the appellant for an “offence” under section 357 of the IR Act. The terms of the section are set out below. It will be seen that there is no reference in the section to an “offence”.
	
	
	At the first mention on 24 July 2013 the defendant entered a plea of Not Guilty in relation to the abovementioned charge.
	
	
	The matter proceeded to a defended hearing. It was heard by the CIM on 12 December 2013 and 10 and 11 March 2014. Judgment was given on 27 June 2014.
	


Evidence in the proceedings below


	
	The prosecution, represented by Ms Wallace, called two witnesses: Mr Ranjeev Kumar and Mr Raymond Ghannoum. The two witnesses were cross-examined. The prosecution also relied on documentary evidence consisting of: a reference letter signed by Mr Ramesh Tanwar; the Determination; and documents produced by a real estate agent who had acted for Mr Kumar. Particular significance was attached to evidence of Mr Kumar’s receipt of the reference letter signed by Mr Tanwar. The letter bore a handwritten date which the respondent submitted was 6 February 2009 written as “6/2/09”. It will be seen that the date of the letter was a key element in the respondent’s case. The date was disputed by the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant was represented at trial by Mr Jackson of counsel. He called three witnesses; Ms Gurpreet Kaur, Ms Shirley Tanwar and Mr Ramesh Tanwar. All three witnesses were required for cross-examination. The appellant also relied on documentary evidence including letters and accounting records such as tax invoices and cash receipts issued by Tanwar, as well as Tanwar’s file copy of the reference letter signed by Mr Tanwar. The appellant contended that the letter was dated 6 July 2009 written as “6/7/09”. The evidence given by the witnesses related to outstanding pay-ins owed by Mr Kumar, as well as the purported payment of $2,000 in advance of holiday pay made by Tanwar to Mr Kumar on 6 July 2009.
	
	
	Throughout the proceedings, the documentary evidence of both parties was in contention. In particular, as I have noted, the date of the reference letter was a key issue. It remains a live issue in these proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to the appellant’s documentary evidence in the court below, Mr Kumar strongly denied ever receiving any of the documents that were purportedly provided to him by Tanwar.
	
	
	The CIM proceeded to determine the matter in a decision handed down on transcript. Her Honour first determined the question as to whether the onus of proof is “on the balance of probabilities or beyond reasonable doubt”. The CIM accepted the onus of proof in s 357 proceedings to be on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Her Honour then considered the evidence of the parties. The CIM considered the essential issue was the “assessment of credit of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances of the interactions between the parties”. On this matter, the CIM found in favour of the prosecution.
	
	
	Her Honour accordingly found on the balance of probabilities that the defendant failed to comply with cl 19 of the Determination by failing to pay annual leave to Mr Kumar in breach of s 357 of the IR Act. Her Honour ordered that a fine of $1,000.00 be issued to Tanwar Enterprises, and ordered payment in the sum of $1,476.53 to Mr Kumar. Her Honour also ordered costs to be paid as agreed or assessed.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Her Honour failed to consider all relevant evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour failed to give sufficient and adequate reasons as to why certain evidence was accepted over other conflicting relevant evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour failed to give sufficient and adequate reasons as to why her Honour preferred the evidence of Ranjeev Kumar over that of other witnesses.
	
	
	Her Honour denied procedural fairness to the appellant.
	
	
	Her Honour applied an inappropriate standard of proof to determine her decision.
	
	
	Her Honour gave inadequate reasons for her decision.
	
	
	Her Honour failed to apply the Briginshaw standard of proof or criminal standard when delivering her decision.
	
	
	Her Honour failed to deal with central issues and rule on the matters that were in controversy between the parties.
	
	
	The decision was against the weight of the evidence.
	


Leave to appeal


	
	The appeal filed on 25 July 2014 was filed using Form 29. That form bears the description “Appeal where Leave Not Required”.
	
	
	In Tanwar Enterprises Pty Limited v New South Wales Industrial Relations [2014] NSWIC 2 (“Tanwar No 1”), his Honour Boland AJ granted the appellant an extension of time to file the appeal, and stayed the orders of the CIM pending the outcome of the appeal. In doing so, his Honour noted at [29]:
	


“…I should add that I regard the question of whether leave is required as a live issue, as is the nature of the appeal.”


	
	The issue in relation to leave to appeal in proceedings under s 197 of the IR Act was briefly discussed in Stockwell International Pty Limited v Solyali [2014] NSWIC 7 at [29]-[32] per Boland AJ.
	
	
	In Stockwell, His Honour stated at [29]-[30]:
	


“[29] It had been the case that an appeal brought under s 197(1)(a) of the Act required leave under s 188(1) of that Act: Drake Personnel Ltd t/as Drake Industrial v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 432; Blue Mountain Disability Services Ltd v Stinson (1999) 92 IR 246. Section 188(2) provides that leave will be granted if the Full Bench is of the opinion that the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, leave should be granted. Section 188(3) provides that the Full Bench may deal with an application for leave to appeal separately and without conducting a hearing into the merits of the appeal.

[30] The Industrial Relations Amendment (Industrial Court) Act 2013 amended the Act to provide, inter alia, that appeals from the Local Court under s 197 were to be heard by a single judicial member of the Industrial Court. Section 188 of the Act applies only to appeals to a Full Bench. It does not appear that any provision has been made in the Act requiring leave where the appeal is to a single judicial member of the Court.”


	
	On the hearing of the proceedings, the respondent did not oppose the grant of leave to appeal. I have not therefore had the benefit of detailed submissions from the parties as to whether leave is required. Were the question limited to the matters referred to by Boland AJ, it seems to me that there would be no requirement for leave. However s 197(2) of the IR Act has the effect of applying the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“Crimes (AR) Act”) to such appeals.
	
	
	In Tanwar No 1 Boland AJ observed at [8]-[11] (noting similar views earlier expressed by Backman J in Golden Swan Investments (Australia) Pty Limited v Workcover Authority of NSW (Inspector Pryor) [2006] NSWIRComm 402) that there are difficulties in determining the proper application of these provisions.
	
	
	I referred to his Honour’s observations in Tanwar No 2 but, like his Honour, I found it unnecessary to resolve those difficulties in deciding the issue then before the Court.
	
	
	I note however that the Crimes (AR) Act requires leave in relation to some appeals; see ss 12 and 53. Other appeals may be brought as of right; see ss 11 and 52. The grounds for the grant of leave are dealt with in different terms; compare ss 16 and 54. That leaves open questions of whether leave is required to appeal to this Court and, if so, in which appeals and on what grounds.
	
	
	Given the circumstances, I do not think this matter provides the appropriate opportunity to determine whether leave is required in appeal proceedings before a single member of the Industrial Court. If leave be necessary, I would grant it for the reasons that follow.
	
	
	Briefly stated, there are questions raised by the appeal that are of general importance. In particular, the appeal raises the important question of the appropriate standard of proof in a prosecution for a civil penalty. While there are numerous decisions in which courts have expressed a view as to the correct standard of proof in such prosecutions under the IR Act, there is no authoritative decision. This appears to be the first time that the issue has been in contest and required a determination. The determination of that issue has an importance extending beyond this case.
	
	
	Also, the appeal raises the question of whether the CIM failed to give sufficient and adequate reasons as to why certain evidence was preferred over other conflicting evidence, and whether the CIM, in failing to give adequate reasons for her decision, denied the appellant procedural fairness. It is in the public interest (cf s 188 IR Act) and the interests of justice (cf s 16 Crimes (AR) Act) to have these various matters determined.
	


Legislative Framework


	
	Section 197 of the IR Act provides:
	


197 Appeals from Local Court 

(1) An appeal lies to the Commission in Court Session against:

(a) any order made under this Act by the Local Court for the payment of money or the dismissal by the Local Court of an application for such an order (including a dismissal on the ground that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with the application), or

(b) any conviction or penalty imposed by the Local Court for an offence against this Act or the regulations, or

(c) a civil penalty imposed under this Act by the Local Court for a contravention of an industrial instrument or the dismissal by the Local Court of proceedings for such a civil penalty, or

(d) a civil penalty imposed under Division 7 of Part 13 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 by the Local Court for a contravention of a WHS civil penalty provision or the dismissal by the Local Court of proceedings for such a civil penalty.

(2) The provisions of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 that relate to:

(a) appeals from the Local Court to the District Court or Supreme Court, and

(b) the decisions of the District Court or Supreme Court on any such appeal, and

(c) the carrying out or enforcement of any such decision, (including those provisions as applied by section 70 of the Local Court Act 2007)

apply, subject to the regulations under this Act, to any appeal referred to in subsection (1).

Consideration

Nature of this appeal


	
	As I stated in Tanwar (No 2) at [22], the issue as to the nature of these appeal proceedings is yet to be determined. I noted, however:
	


“… What appears to be accepted is that the appeal is not a hearing de novo: see in this respect Drake Personnel Ltd v Workcover Authority (NSW) [1999] NSWIRComm 343; (1999) 90 IR 464. The appeal may be either a rehearing or an appeal stricto sensu.”


	
	The appellant submitted the nature of the present appeal proceedings to be a rehearing, citing in support the decision of Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Earl Burns [2010] NSWCA 265 (“Earl Burns”) at [23] per Beazley JA with whom Basten and Campbell JJA agreed.
	
	
	In Earl Burns, Beazley JA said at [23]-[25]:
	


“[23] The nature of an appeal to the District Court under Pt 3 was considered by this Court in Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; 164 A Crim R 39. Mason P observed that the appeal is by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcript, supplemented by any documentary evidence and any evidence admitted by leave pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 18(2). His Honour stated that the District Court is required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses in the lower court: see Bell v Stewart [1920] HCA 68; (1920) 28 CLR 419 at 424-5; Paterson v Paterson [1953] HCA 74; (1953) 89 CLR 212; Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118.

[24] In Fox v Percy, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ noted, at [22], that:

“The ‘rehearing’ does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence. That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits.”

[25] Their Honours also noted, at [23], that a court conducting an appeal by way of rehearing on the record is required to observe the limitations of such an appeal, including, relevantly to this matter:

‘… the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share …’ ”


	
	The respondent made very limited submissions as to the nature of the appeal in Tanwar No 2. In the appeal proceedings the respondent did not make any further submissions on this point beyond the following oral submission:
	


“Our submissions are that her Honour has given an analysis and consideration and reasons that were adequate. However, if your Honour is against me on this, we submit that your Honour could analyse the evidence yourself to give those adequate reasons.”


	
	It seems implicit in that submission that the respondent accepts that the appeal is by way of rehearing.
	
	
	Earl Burns dealt with appeals from the Local Court to the District Court. Such appeals are governed by ss 17 and 18 of the Crimes (AR) Act which specify such appeals are to be by way of rehearing. There are no equivalent provisions to ss 17 and 18 in relation to appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court.
	
	
	I have identified no authority dealing with the nature of an appeal to the Supreme Court. That may be because such appeals are confined to “a question of law alone” unless the Court grants leave to raise a question which includes a question of fact. As a preliminary observation, it would seem extremely unlikely that the legislature intended a broader appeal to the Supreme Court on questions of fact than are permitted to the District Court. More particularly, the legislative context would suggest the appeal to the Supreme Court is an appeal in the strict sense.
	
	
	In Coal and Allied Operations Pty Limited v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; 203 CLR 194, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ commented on the nature of appeals and in particular the distinction between an appeal in the strict sense and an appeal by way of rehearing. Their Honours said (citations omitted):
	


“[11] It was pointed out in Brideson [No 2] that ""the nature of [an] appeal must ultimately depend on the terms of the statute conferring the right [of appeal]"". The statute in question may confer limited or large powers on an appellate body; it may confer powers that are unique to the tribunal concerned or powers that are common to other appellate bodies. There is, thus, no definitive classification of appeals, merely descriptive phrases by which an appeal to one body may sometimes be conveniently distinguished from an appeal to another.

[12] It is common and often convenient to describe an appeal to a court or tribunal whose function is simply to determine whether the decision in question was right or wrong on the evidence and the law as it stood when that decision was given as an appeal in the strict sense. An appeal to this Court under s73 of the Constitution is an appeal of that kind. In the case of an appeal in the strict sense, an appellate court or tribunal cannot receive further evidence and its powers are limited to setting aside the decision under appeal and, if it be appropriate, to substituting the decision that should have been made at first instance.

[13] If an appellate tribunal can receive further evidence and its powers are not restricted to making the decision that should have been made at first instance, the appeal is usually and conveniently described as an appeal by way of rehearing. Although further evidence may be admitted on an appeal of that kind, the appeal is usually conducted by reference to the evidence given at first instance and is to be contrasted with an appeal by way of hearing de novo. In the case of a hearing de novo, the matter is heard afresh and a decision is given on the evidence presented at that hearing.

[14] Ordinarily, if there has been no further evidence admitted and if there has been no relevant change in the law, a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision-maker. That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error. However, the conferral of a right of appeal by way of a hearing de novo is construed as a proceeding in which the appellate body is required to exercise its powers whether or not there was error at first instance.”


	
	In this matter the appeal has been conducted on the basis of the evidence and law as it stood at the time of the CIM’s decision. In that sense there is little if any practical difference (in this instance) between an appeal in the strict sense and one by way of rehearing. While it is therefore unnecessary to determine the issue to finality, I am inclined to the view that the appeal is by way of rehearing. As s 197(2) of the IR Act embraces both the provisions relating to appeals to the District Court and appeals to the Supreme Court, it would seem that the statute intends the appeal to be tailored to the issues raised. In either case the process involves the identification and correction of error.
	
	
	On this basis, I will approach the nature of the present proceedings as an appeal by way of rehearing, observing the limitations of such an appeal: see Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [22]-[23] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ.
	


Appropriate standard of proof


	
	The first issue to be determined is whether the CIM applied the appropriate standard of proof in the proceedings below, being ground five of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. Ground seven of the appellant’s grounds is related.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant, Mr R J de Meyrick, submitted the appropriate standard in s 357 proceedings is the criminal standard, that is, proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the alternative, if the primary position be not accepted, the appellant submitted the civil standard should be applied, guided by the principles enunciated in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 per Dixon J.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the CIM simply applied the civil standard and that amounted to error.
	
	
	The appellant acknowledged that the Industrial Court has generally regarded proceedings under s 357 of the IR Act as civil proceedings. However there does not appear to be, it submitted, any recent or comprehensive analysis of the correctness of that approach: see for example, Bluescope Steel Limited v The Australian Workers' Union, New South Wales [2007] NSWIRComm 307; (2007) 160 IR 456; Transport Workers' Union of Australia New South Wales Branch v Australian Document Exchange Pty Ltd trading as Grace Couriers [2000] NSWIRComm 74; BHP Steel Ltd v The Australian Workers' Union, New South Wales [2003] NSWIRComm 151; Ian Robertson v Marrickville Council [2003] NSWIRComm 394.
	
	
	As the basis for its argument that the appropriate standard of proof in relation to a successful prosecution under s 357 of the IR Act is the criminal standard, the appellant focused on the concept of “conviction”. In this respect counsel referred to Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 49; (2003) 216 CLR 161 (“Labrador”).
	
	
	In Labrador, Hayne J stated at [138] (citations omitted) :
	


“Seeking to obtain the conviction of a person accused of contravening written or unwritten law lies at the heart of the criminal process. The fact of conviction is an important criterion for the operation of constitutional provisions and the operation of federal and State legislation. Absent statutory provision to the contrary, a conviction should not be recorded except where the requisite elements of the contravening conduct are established beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	It should be noted that the word “conviction” does not appear in s 357 of the IR Act. Nor do any of its cognates. Counsel sought to circumvent that shortcoming by reference to the dicta of Dawson and McHugh JJ in Maxwell v R [1996] HCA 46; (1996) 184 CLR 501. Counsel’s written submissions expressed the argument as follows:
	


8. In Maxwell v R (1996) 184 CLR 501, at [9], the High Court defined a conviction simply as a final determination of guilt with respect to an offence. The High Court contrasted this with actions where a declaration was sought, along with recovery of a penalty.

9. A precondition to imposing a penalty under section 357(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) is a finding of guilt; the court must first satisfy itself that a contravention of an industrial instrument has occurred.

10. Consequently, the court determines guilt, and the criminal standard of proof applies, that is proof beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	In my view the passage referred to from Maxwell cannot be so simply summarised. Their Honours said (citations omitted):
	


“[9] The question of what amounts to a conviction admits of no single, comprehensive answer. Indeed, the answer to the question rather depends upon the context in which it is asked. On the one hand, a verdict of guilty by a jury or a plea of guilty upon arraignment has been said to amount to a conviction. On the other hand, it has been said that there can be no conviction until there is a judgment of the court, ordinarily in the form of a sentence, following upon the verdict or plea. Thus Tindal CJ said in Burgess v Boetefeur:

""The word 'conviction' is undoubtedly verbum aequivocum. It is sometimes used as meaning the verdict of a jury, and at other times, in its more strictly legal sense, for the sentence of the court."" ((their Honour’s) Emphasis added)

[10] The context in which the question arises for present purposes is that of autrefois convict and in that context it would seem clear that a verdict or plea of guilty is insufficient of itself to constitute a conviction. That accords with the principle lying behind the plea of autrefois convict which is that a person should not be punished more than once for the same matter.”


	
	These paragraphs indicate that the term “conviction” does not have a single meaning. It depends upon the context in which it is used. In Maxwell the context was a plea of “autrefois convict”.
	
	
	The circumstances may be briefly described. The appellant was charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. The prosecution accepted the plea on the basis of diminished responsibility. The prosecution and the defence then put material, including psychiatric reports, before the trial judge for the purpose of sentencing. Counsel addressed on sentence and the judge retired to consider the matter. When the matter resumed the trial judge delivered a judgment in which he expressed doubt as to whether he could accept the plea. The trial was again adjourned and on resumption a further psychiatric report was tendered casting further doubt on the issue of diminished responsibility. The prosecutor, although he did not seek to withdraw his acceptance of the plea, submitted his Honour should reject it. The appellant submitted that the judge had no power to do so.
	
	
	The issue before the High Court was to determine the availability of the plea of autrefois convict. Their Honour’s therefore analysed what had happened in the particular proceedings, which were undoubtedly criminal in nature, in order to decide whether a “conviction” for manslaughter had occurred.
	
	
	The circumstances are quite different here. Here the issue is whether the proceedings are criminal in nature. The argument of the appellant is that they are criminal because there is a conviction and there is a conviction because the proceedings are criminal. Neither premise has been clearly established.
	
	
	Equally the passage relied upon from the reasons of Hayne J in Labrador has to be considered in context. That case concerned prosecutions under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and the Excise Act 1901 (Cth). The Court had regard to the particular statutory provisions in determining what standard of proof should apply. Gleeson CJ who agreed with Hayne J added at [2]:
	


“As to the question of standard of proof, the statutory provisions invoked by the appellant in these proceedings refer to offences, guilt, conviction and punishment. To paraphrase what was said by McTiernan J in Mallan v Lee, the legislative description of the conduct alleged, and of the orders which the appellant seeks, should be accepted at face value. That being so, the common law requires that the appellant should establish the elements of the alleged offences beyond reasonable doubt.” (Emphasis added)


	
	Similarly Gummow J at [14] made the general observations as to the statutory provisions that:
	


“The form in which all of these provisions are cast is significant. It indicates that what is sought against the respondents are convictions for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. Ordinary understanding then would suggest that what is required for that result is proof beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	Hayne J said at [135]-[136]:
	


“[135] What does the common law require? Where what is sought is conviction of the defendant for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, it must be strongly arguable that nothing short of proof beyond reasonable doubt will do. If no conviction is sought, but other relief is (as, for example, a declaration that the defendant contravened identified provisions of the relevant Act coupled with orders for payment of monetary penalties), it must be strongly arguable that, in proceedings conducted according to civil procedures, proof to the civil standard will suffice. No doubt, in accordance with well-established principle , if the civil standard were to be applied, “the nature of the issue [would] necessarily [affect] the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained” and “exactness of proof [would be] expected.

[136] Those tentative conclusions do not depend upon attributing a description of “civil” or “criminal” to the proceedings as a whole or seeking to identify some “essential character” of the proceedings. (By what process of distillation the “essential character” of proceedings could be revealed is not apparent.) Rather, the conclusions proposed focus upon, and attach significance to, the kinds of orders which the proceedings seek. In particular, proceedings are distinguished according to whether or not they seek the conviction of the defendant for an offence.”


	
	The well-established principle to which his Honour refers in [135] is of course Briginshaw. 
	
	
	These passages direct attention to context and, in particular, the terms of the legislation sought to be enforced. Thus it is necessary to consider the terms of the legislation here in question.
	


Offences under the IR Act


	
	The IR Act prescribes an array of obligations. It also uses a variety of forms of language in making provision for enforcement of those obligations. The starting point in this case must be s 357. Section 357 of the IR Act provides:
	


357   Civil penalty for breach of industrial instruments

(1)  If an industrial court is satisfied that a person has contravened a provision of an industrial instrument, it may order the person to pay a pecuniary penalty not exceeding $10,000 (a civil penalty).

Note. Section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987 provides that the expression “contravene” in an Act includes a failure to comply.

(2)  Proceedings for a civil penalty may be instituted:

(a)  by an inspector or any other person authorised by this Act to institute proceedings for offences, or

(b)  by an employer bound by the industrial instrument concerned, or

(c)  by an industrial organisation concerned in the industry to which the proceedings relate.

(3)  Proceedings for a civil penalty may be instituted within 6 years after the contravention.

(4)  To avoid doubt, the rules of evidence apply to proceedings for a civil penalty.

(5)  Evidence given in proceedings for the recovery of money under Part 2 is not admissible in proceedings for a civil penalty.

(6)  In any proceedings for a civil penalty, the industrial court may award costs to either party and assess the amount of those costs. Costs cannot be awarded against the prosecutor except in the circumstances in which costs can be awarded against the prosecutor in criminal proceedings.

(7)  The following provisions apply to contraventions of industrial instruments and to proceedings for a civil penalty for such a contravention in the same way as they apply to criminal proceedings for an offence against this Act:

(a)  Sections 400–403.

(b)  The provisions of any Act relating to the recovery of penalties imposed for an offence.

(c)  Any provision of this or any other Act relating to criminal proceedings that is applied to this section by the regulations (whether with or without modification).


	
	A simple application of the principles in Labrador to this section would lead to a conclusion contrary to the appellant’s primary submission.
	
	
	The section does not speak of “guilt”, “conviction”, “offence” or “punishment”. It draws a distinction between “proceedings for a civil penalty” and “criminal proceedings” in subss (6) and (7). It prescribes the relevant penalty as a monetary sum rather than in penalty units. It describes the penalty as a “civil” penalty. The persons authorised to institute proceedings overlap with those authorised to institute proceedings for offences (see s 399) but include others. The section makes clear that the rules of evidence apply to such proceedings. Such provision would certainly be unnecessary in relation to criminal proceedings but equally is unnecessary for proceedings before the Industrial Court (see s 163(2)). These provisions point to a legislative intention to distinguish civil penalty proceedings from criminal proceedings.
	
	
	Other provisions of the IR Act similarly draw a distinction between civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings. Examples can be seen in s 197(1)(b) and (c) and s 383(2) and cl 43 of the Industrial Relations (General) Regulation 2001 (NSW) (“the General Regulation”).
	
	
	On the other hand the section does refer to a “contravention”. It also provides for the imposition of a penalty. Section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) defines “penalty” to “include forfeiture and punishment” [emphasis added]. The CIM, in hearing such matters is required by s 383 (and cl 43 of the General Regulation) to apply the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and (expressly) not the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Another section of particular interest in this context is s 400 of the IR Act. It provides:
	


400   Offences by corporation

(1)  If a corporation contravenes, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Act or the regulations, each person who is a director of the corporation or who is concerned in the management of the corporation is taken to have contravened the same provision if the person knowingly authorised or permitted the contravention.

(1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of a contravention of section 361.

(2)  A person may be proceeded against and convicted under a provision pursuant to this section whether or not the corporation has been proceeded against or been convicted under that provision.

(3)  Nothing in this section affects any liability imposed on a corporation for an offence committed by the corporation against this Act or the regulations.

(4)  In this section, corporation does not include an industrial organisation.

[Emphasis added]


	
	This section speaks of contravening a provision of the IR Act but also describes a finding of breach as a “conviction”. The section applies to contraventions of any provision of the IR Act. It may be that that the draftsperson considered s 357 was not embraced by that description because that section deals with contraventions of industrial instruments, that is, not provisions of the IR Act but provisions of instruments made under it. Any doubt about its application is removed by s 357(7)(a). The result is to refer to “convictions” for “contravention” of s 357. That is done, however, in the context of an extended application of s 400.
	
	
	The appellant’s reliance on Labrador receives some support because the language of “punishment” and “conviction” is used, at least in relation to the enforcement provisions if not within its terms.
	
	
	A review of other enforcement provisions of the IR Act does not demonstrate a uniform use of language of enforcement. Some provisions do use words like “offence” and “guilt” and express the penalty in terms of “penalty units”. Such provisions accordingly directly embrace those concepts. Section 180 of the IR Act for example provides:
	


180   Contempt of Commission—offence

(1)  A person in contempt of the Commission is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: 500 penalty units in the case of a corporation or, in any other case, 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months, or both. (Emphasis added)


	
	There can be little doubt that proceedings for an offence against this section are criminal in nature. The potential for imprisonment as a punishment invites no other conclusion. Other provisions which follow this form (“type one penalty provisions”), albeit without the potential for imprisonment, but in which a person who fails to comply is “guilty of an offence” are: ss 70(5), 127(8), 128, 129, 143, 165(4), 184(3) and 278(9).
	
	
	By way of contrast there are a number of provisions (“type two penalty provisions”) which don’t use the language of “guilty of an offence” but prescribe monetary penalties for, at least implicitly, a failure to comply. An example is s 67(2). It provides:
	


67   Employer’s obligations

(1) Information to employees

On becoming aware that an employee (or an employee’s spouse) is pregnant, or that an employee is adopting a child, an employer must inform the employee of:

(a)  the employee’s entitlements to parental leave under this Part, and

(b)  the employee’s obligations to notify the employer of any matter under this Part.

An employer cannot rely on an employee’s failure to give a notice or other document required by this Part unless the employer establishes that this subsection has been complied with in relation to the employee.

(2) Records

An employer must keep, for at least 6 years, a record of parental leave granted under this Part to employees and all notices and documents given under this Part by employees or the employer.

Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.


	
	The format of this type of provision is to prescribe a duty or duties and a penalty for, implicitly, a failure to comply. There is no mention of “guilt” or “offence”. Other provisions of this kind are: ss 68(1), 70(5), 78(5), 82(2), 117, 118, 119, 122(1), 123(1), 267, 268, 269(1), 361 and 363.
	
	
	A third form (“type three penalty provisions”) used in the IR Act is illustrated by s 129H. It has a section heading referring to “Offences” but is otherwise in the form of the last mentioned group. It provides:
	


129H   Offences relating to unpaid remuneration claims and referred claims

A person must not:

(a)  by intimidation or by any other act or omission, intentionally hinder, prevent or discourage a person from making an unpaid remuneration claim, or

(b)  make any statement that the person knows is false or misleading in a material particular in any notice given for the purposes of section 129E or 129F, or

(c)  serve a referred claim on a person under section 129E that the person does not know, or have reasonable grounds to believe, is an actual employer.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units


	
	Other provisions which follow this form are ss 250 and 301.
	
	
	A variant on this form is a hybrid with the second form. An example is s 360 which provides:
	


360   Advertisements that contravene industrial instruments

(1)  A person must not advertise, or cause to be advertised, that the person is offering or seeking employment on terms that would constitute a contravention of an industrial instrument.

(2)  The publisher of a newspaper or other publication in which such an advertisement has been published must, on demand by any person authorised to prosecute the offence against subsection (1), disclose to that authorised person the name and address (if known) of the person who placed the advertisement in the newspaper or other publication.

(3)  Proceedings for an offence against this section may be instituted by any person authorised to institute proceedings for a civil penalty under this Part.

Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. [Emphasis added]


	
	In this form the reference to “offence” is found in the prescription of persons who are authorised to commence enforcement proceedings. It is interesting that the authority to institute proceedings “for an offence against this section” is granted to persons who may “institute proceedings for a civil penalty”, which must refer back to s 357(2). It is not clear why that option was chosen rather than relying upon s 399 other than the connection with industrial instruments. That begs the question why one is an offence provision and the other a civil penalty provision.
	
	
	Another complication in characterising these type two and type three penalty provisions is found in s 272 which is in Div 6 of Pt 4. It provides:
	


272   Interpretation

(1)  In this Division, serious offence means:

(a)  an offence under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory, or of another country, involving fraud or dishonesty and punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of 3 months or more, or

(b)  an offence against section 250 or any of the provisions of Division 5, or

(c)  any other offence in relation to the formation, registration or management of an organisation registered under this Chapter, or

(d)  any other offence under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory, or of another country, involving the intentional use of violence towards another person, the intentional causing of death or injury to another person or the intentional damaging or destruction of property.

(2)  A reference in this Division to a person having been convicted of a serious offence includes a reference to a person having been so convicted before the commencement of this section.

(3)  A reference in this Division to a person being convicted of a serious offence does not include a reference to a person being convicted, otherwise than on indictment, of an offence referred to in subsection (1) (c).

(4)  A reference in this Division to a person being convicted of a serious offence does not include a reference to a person being convicted of an offence referred to in subsection (1) (d) unless the person has served, or is serving, a term of imprisonment in relation to the offence.

(5)  A certificate purporting to be signed by the Industrial Registrar or other proper officer of a federal court, a court of a State or Territory, or a court of another country, stating that a person was convicted by the court of a specified offence on a specified day is, for the purpose of an application made under this Division, evidence that the person was convicted of the offence on that day.

(6)  A certificate purporting to be signed by the Industrial Registrar or other proper officer of a federal court, a court of a State or Territory, or a court of another country, stating that a person was acquitted by the court of a specified offence, or that a specified charge against the person was dismissed by the court, is, for the purpose of an application made under this Division, evidence of the facts stated in the certificate.

(7)  A certificate purporting to be signed by the officer in charge of a prison stating that a person was released from the prison on a specified day is, for the purpose of an application made under this Division, evidence that the person was released from the prison on that day.

[Emphasis added]


	
	The “serious offences” referred to in subs (1)(b) and (c) include provisions falling within the type two penalty provisions. That is, there is no reference to offence, guilt or conviction within the provision itself. Examples are ss 267, 268 and 269(1). Yet they are described in the same legislation as “serious offences”. These “serious offences“ also include type three penalty provisions such as s 250.
	
	
	The relevance of describing these penalty provisions as “serious offences” is of course unrelated to their enforcement. It relates to disqualification from holding office in State organisations registered under the Act: see IR Act s 273. The fact of the legislation describing such penalty provisions as “serious offences” and referring to “conviction” in relation to such provisions, however, cannot be dismissed out of hand in the present context. In construing statutory provisions it is necessary to refer “to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole” and “on the prima facie basis that the provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals”: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69]-[70].
	
	
	Other provisions of the IR Act also provide insight into the legislative intention in relation to penalty provisions. As noted above, s 383 requires the application of the Criminal Procedure Act to proceedings before the CIM. Penalty notices may be served for offences against the IR Act under s 396 if the regulations prescribe them as penalty notice offences. Schedule 2 of the General Regulation lists some 11 such offences including type two, three and hybrid form “offence” provisions.
	
	
	Proceedings for an “offence” are to be dealt with summarily; s 397. The time for instituting proceedings for an “offence” is prescribed in s 398. There is a general prescription of 12 months except for s180 and ss 267, 268 and 269 for which the limits are respectively 6 months (under the Criminal Procedure Act) and 5 years. The authority to prosecute for an offence is regulated by s 399 without distinguishing between the various forms (although s 360 provides an exception).
	
	
	There are contrasts between s 357 and these other types of provisions, but then there are contrasts between the other types of provisions themselves. If there were a consistent treatment of “criminal” penalty provisions the contrast with “civil” penalty provisions would be more easily accepted and understood. Some of the drafting disparities between the “criminal” penalty provisions are mitigated by s 18 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). It provides:
	


18   Interpretation of provisions imposing penalties

(1)  The penalty:

(a)  specified at the end of a section of an Act (whether or not the section is divided into subsections), or

(b)  specified at the end of a subsection of a section of an Act, but not at the end of the section, or

(c)  specified at the end of a section of an Act or subsection of a section of an Act and expressed in such a way as to indicate that it applies to part only of the section or subsection,

indicates that a contravention of the section, subsection or part, respectively, is an offence against the Act, punishable on conviction by a penalty not exceeding the penalty so specified.

(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a penalty specified at the end of the last subsection of a section is taken not to be specified at the end of the section if a penalty is specified at the end of any previous subsection.

(3)  If:

(a)  a section of an Act, or a subsection of a section of an Act, provides that a person is guilty of an offence under specified circumstances, and

(b)  a penalty is specified at the end of the section or subsection and expressed in such a way as to indicate that it applies to the section or subsection,

a person who is guilty of such an offence is liable, on conviction, to a penalty not exceeding the penalty so specified.

(4)  This section applies to a statutory rule in the same way as it applies to an Act, subject to any necessary modification.

(5)  This section applies to a provision of an Act or statutory rule except in so far as the contrary intention appears in the Act or statutory rule concerned.

[Emphasis added]


	
	It would seem this section overcomes many of the differences which might otherwise indicate some distinction was to be drawn between the various forms of penalty provisions in the IR Act. Section 18(1) for example indicates that, whether or not the particular section uses the language of “guilt”, “offence” or “punishment”, the effect of specifying a penalty is to indicate that a person who contravenes the section commits an offence punishable on conviction by the imposition of a penalty up to the maximum specified.
	
	
	However, s 357 of the IR Act also specifies a penalty. The question then is whether s 357 exhibits a “contrary intention”, within the meaning of s 18(5), so as to limit the application of s 18 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Thus the argument comes full circle and is driven back to the terms of s 357.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that proceedings under s 357 of the IR Act, in its statutory context, are civil in nature and, as such, the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. Ms Wallace’s submissions traversed many of the points referred to above but also dealt with the historical development of the section. She submitted:
	


“The nature of statute dealing with a failure to observe the provision of an award has altered over time. Whereas previously such proceedings were characterised as criminal in nature, more recently enforcement measures are rather by civil proceedings.

In 1943, the Industrial Relations Act 1940 (which had in 1940 replaced the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912 in essentially the same terms) was significantly amended and the amendments to s.93(1), which dealt with breaches of an industrial instrument, were found to have made it one of a criminal nature: Platt v Treweneck [1953] AR (NSW) 642 at 658-659. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the amendments had the effect of altering the method of recovery of a penalty, such that it was no longer recovered in the same fashion as a civil judgment, rather, such penalties were to be recovered in accordance with the Justices Act 1902, with the effect that a person who defaulted on payment of a penalty would be liable to imprisonment.

In 1991, the Industrial Relations Act 1940 was replaced by the Industrial Relations Act 1991, which provided in s.166 that the breach of an industrial award was an offence with a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units.

In 1996, the Industrial Relations Act 1991 was then replaced by the Industrial Relations Act 1996. In the second reading speech of the Industrial Relations Bill 1996, the Hon. J Shaw said of s.357:

“Part 1 of chapter 7 deals with the breach of awards and other industrial instruments. It provides a civil penalty carrying a maximum fine of $10,000 which may be imposed by the commission in court session or a Local Court constituted by an industrial magistrate. The breach of an award or enterprise agreement is presently a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of $5,000. The new provision will remove the criminal nature of non-compliance proceedings and the civil standard of proof will facilitate enforcement. (Legislative Council, Hansard, 23 November 1995, p.3856) ([Ms Wallace’s] emphasis)”


	
	This history indicates an intention of the legislature to change the nature of the proceedings from criminal to civil.
	
	
	In regard to the differences between s 357 and criminal offence provisions in the IR Act, the respondent submitted:
	


“Section 357(1) explicitly describes a penalty under s.357 as a “civil penalty”.

Section 357 of the IR Act makes no reference to a conviction following the imposition of a civil penalty.

The terms of s.357(1), which prescribe the maximum amount of a civil penalty that may be imposed upon an industrial court finding a contravention, is not specified at the end of the section or subsection as one would expect where the penalty imposed is for a criminal offence: see s.18(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, an example of which is in s.360 IR Act (advertisements that contravene industrial instruments).

Like s.357, s.360 is in Part 1 of Ch.7 of the IR Act. But s.360(1) clearly prescribes an offence, having regard to s.18(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The contrast in structure with s.357 fortifies a view that s.357 differs from s.360 and is not intended to make conduct that contravenes s.357 a criminal offence.

Section 357(1), prescribes a maximum amount in monetary terms - $10,000 – rather than prescribing a maximum penalty in penalty units to be calculated by reference to s.17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, although that in itself is not determinative. From time to time other provisions that deal with maximum penalties for criminal offences prescribe a maximum monetary penalty.

Having said that, I cannot see any penalty for a criminal offence in the IR Act that is imposed in monetary terms – the IR Act appears to prescribe all penalties for offences against it in penalty unit terms.

The language of s.357(6) of the IR Act distinguishes civil penalty proceedings from ""criminal proceedings"" in that the costs provisions applying to criminal proceedings are made to expressly apply to proceedings for a civil penalty by s.357(6).

The language of s.357(7)(b) of the IR Act distinguishes civil penalty proceedings from ""criminal proceedings"" as the provisions applying to criminal proceedings for an offence against the IR Act apply to proceedings for a civil penalty only as provided for by s.357(7)(b). Section 357(7)(b) of the IR Act provides that the provisions of “any Act relating to the recovery of penalties imposed for an offence” apply to proceedings for a civil penalty in the same was as they apply to criminal proceedings for an offence against the IR Act.”


	
	The validity of these distinctions is borne out by my above analysis of the various forms of enforcement provisions. I am not convinced that it can be said that the penalty in s 357 “is not specified at the end of the section or subsection as one would expect where the penalty imposed is for a criminal offence”. It is true that the penalty is specified as part of subsection one but I don’t think it can be described as being anywhere other than at the end of the subsection. I accept the submissions otherwise.
	
	
	The respondent further submitted:
	


“[T]he IR Act has different requirements for criminal and civil penalty proceedings in terms of the authority to prosecute, the issuing of penalty notices, and the time for instituting proceedings.

First, s.399 prescribes that proceedings commenced for an offence under the IR Act may be commenced by the Minister, an inspector or a person of a class prescribed by the regulations (an “industrial organisation concerned in the industry to which the proceedings relate” has been so prescribed by cl.37(2) Industrial Relations (General) Regulation 2001). By way of contrast, under s.357(2) proceedings for a civil penalty may be instituted by an inspector, an employer bound by the industrial instrument, an industrial organisation concerned in the industry or other person prescribed by the regulations.

Secondly, penalty notices may be issued for a list of offences in the IR Act (s.396 IR Act, cl.39 and Sch. 2 Industrial Relations (General) Regulation 2001) but s.357 is not on that list.

Thirdly, proceedings for offences under the IR Act must be commenced not later than 12 months or five years after the offence was alleged to have been committed (s.398 IR Act) whereas proceedings for a civil penalty may be instituted within 6 years after the contravention (s.357(3) IR Act).

A distinction is also made in s.197(1) of the IR Act, which differentiates between ‘any conviction or penalty imposed…for an offence” (s.197(1)(b)), and “a civil penalty imposed for contravention of an industrial instrument.’”


	
	Again these submissions accord with my analysis above and I accept them as pointing to the different legislative treatment of s 357.
	
	
	It appears the practice of the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court in dealing with proceedings for a civil penalty, such as those under s 357 of the IR Act, is to determine them on a balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the decisions of Chief Industrial Magistrate Miller in Joy Pride v Mark Hansen Real Estate Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCIMC 54 and of his Honour Peterson J in Ian Robertson v Marrickville Council as the basis for s 357 proceedings to be decided on a civil standard of proof rather than the criminal standard.
	
	
	In Ian Robertson v Marrickville Council the defendant conceded the criminal standard of proof applied. Notwithstanding this, Peterson J regarded, at [26]:
	


“… the very description of penalty in s 357 as a “civil penalty.”

as a compelling indication of the nature of proceedings under the section.


	
	I accept that s 383 of the IR Act provides that the Criminal Procedure Act and other Acts regulating the procedure before the Local Court, excluding the Civil Procedure Act, apply to s 357 proceedings.
	
	
	I also accept that, in practice, the words ‘prosecution’, ‘guilt’ and ‘plea’ are used in relation to s 357 proceedings, no doubt because of the application of the Criminal Procedure Act, but the language of the section, the statutory context and the history of the development of the section, particularly the change in 1996, satisfy me that the proceedings are civil in nature.
	


The Standard of Proof


	
	There is no dispute that the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies in any s 357 proceedings
	
	
	Section 140 of the Evidence Act, which prescribes the standard of proof in civil proceedings, provides:
	


140 Civil proceedings: standard of proof

(1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:

(a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and

(b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and

(c) the gravity of the matters alleged.


	
	It follows that the standard to be applied in this case is satisfaction on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that s 140 of the Evidence Act in large measure encapsulates in statutory form the relevant observations by the High Court in Briginshaw at 360-363 per Dixon J.
	
	
	In Briginshaw, Dixon J said at 362 that:
	


“[R]easonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of a fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal. In such matters ‘reasonable satisfaction’ should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences.”


	
	In its written submissions to the CIM (which were also relied upon on appeal) the respondent made the following points about the application of the standard:
	


“As explained by the plurality in Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited [[1992] HCA 66] (1992) 110 ALR 449, per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ at [450]: “[T]he strength of the evidence necessary to establish the fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought to prove.” So, where so serious a matter as, for example, fraud is to be found then clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary: Neat Holdings. That proposition reflects that a court should not lightly find that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.”


	
	It is as well to bear in mind the explanation by the plurality in Neat Holdings [1992] HCA 66; (1992) 110 ALR 449 of this concept of qualification of the standard. Their Honours noted that descriptors such as “clear”, cogent” and “strict proof” are not directed to the standard of proof. They stated at 450:
	


“Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.”


	
	In Neat Holdings the parties each alleged that the other had falsified the financial records. Their Honours observed, at 451, that when faced with such competing propositions of fraud:
	


“…generalisations about the need for clear and cogent proof are likely to be at best unhelpful and at worst misleading. If such generalisations were to affect the proof required of the party bearing the onus of proving the issue, the issue would be determined not on the balance of probabilities but by an unbalanced standard. The most that can validly be said in such a case is that the trial judge should be conscious of the gravity of the allegations made on both sides when reaching his or her conclusion. Ultimately, however, it remains incumbent upon the trial judge to determine the issue by reference to the balance of probabilities.”


	
	These passages signify that there is but one standard applicable to civil proceedings but in applying it one must have regard to the gravity of the matters alleged, the inherent likelihood and the context in which they are to be determined.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the appellant submitted that even if the standard of proof in s 357 proceedings is found to be on the balance of probabilities, the Briginshaw test applies. It was submitted that the Bringinshaw test had been held by the Commission on a number of occasions to be appropriate given the gravity and consequences of a finding of breach of an industrial instrument. Examples cited were: Bluescope Steel Limited v The Australian Workers' Union, New South Wales; and Bluescope Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Australian Workers Union, New South Wales [2005] NSWIRComm 99; (2005) 138 IR 324.
	
	
	The relationship between s 140 of the Evidence Act and Briginshaw was recently adverted to in Curtis v Harden Shire Council [2014] NSWCA 314; (2014) 203 LGERA 352. Beazley P stated at [174]:
	


“The Evidence Act 1995, s 140, which now specifies the standard of proof that applies in civil cases, restates the common law position that the civil standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities: s 140(1). Section 140(2) provides that the matters the court may (non-exclusively) take into account in deciding whether it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities include: the nature of the cause of action or defence (para (a)); the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding (para (b)); and the gravity of the matters alleged (para (c)). It has been accepted that para (c) reflects the common law principles stated in Briginshaw: see Pedler v Richardson (unreported, Supreme Court, Young J, 16 October 1997); Wily v Fitz-Gibbon (unreported, Federal Court, Hill J, 2 March 1998);Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [60]. In Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008[ FCA 69 at [139], Branson J adopted the language of the High Court in Neat Holdings v Karajan Holdings, in finding that under s 140:

‘… the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove.’”


	
	Thus s 140 of the Evidence Act and Briginshaw intersect, but the application of the latter does not involve all of the former.
	
	
	I am of the view that the relevant standard of proof for s 357 proceedings is the civil standard, having regard to the considerations relevant under s 140(2) of the Evidence Act.
	


Reasoning disclosed


	
	As I have noted her Honour’s judgment was delivered on 27 June 2014, approximately 3 months after the conclusion of the evidence and some 6 months after hearing the bulk (he was recalled briefly on the second day of hearing) of the evidence of Mr Kumar.
	
	
	Her Honour first set out the terms of s 357 of the IR Act. She then turned to the question of onus, referring to the history of the legislation, earlier decisions of the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court and the decision in Ian Robertson v Marrickville Council. Her Honour also referred to decisions of the federal Court relating to enforcement of civil penalty provisions. The CIM then set out the terms of s 140 of the Evidence Act and specifically referred to s 140(2) and Briginshaw quoting from the judgment of Dixon J.
	
	
	Her Honour then referred to the submissions of the prosecutor (set out above) as to the history of the legislation, the legislative context, the nature of the proceedings and the application of the civil standard of proof. The CIM accepted that the proceedings were civil and therefore, in accordance with s 140 of the Evidence Act were to be determined on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The CIM recorded next the matters not in dispute. She then stated the question to be determined: whether Mr Kumar was paid his annual leave?
	
	
	Her Honour summarised the prosecution’s evidence from Mr Kumar and Mr Ghannoum. She notes that Mr Kumar was extensively cross-examined and that:
	


“Credit was plainly an issue during these proceedings. It was suggested to him that he wrote the reference for the real estate agent, the issue being that Mr Kumar said it was given to him in February 2009 whilst Mr Tanwar said it was July 2009 because it was not on Tanwar letterhead. This was strongly denied.”


	
	Her Honour made no observations as to the demeanour or credibility of either witness.
	
	
	The judgment then continues with a summary of the evidence called on behalf of Tanwar beginning with the evidence of Ms Kaur who was employed as the assistant accountant. At the conclusion of that summary her Honour made the following observation:
	


“Ms Kaur was a witness who was somewhat dogmatic in her approach to giving evidence. She did not make allowances in her evidence and as an employee of Mr Tanwar, cannot be seen to be wholly objective.”


	
	The evidence of Mrs Tanwar was next summarised. The CIM noted that she was a joint proprietor of the business with her husband to whom she had been married for 22 years. Her Honour observed:
	


“Mrs Tanwar cannot be described also as an independent witness”


	
	Then followed a summary of the evidence of Mr Tanwar at the conclusion of which the CIM observed:
	


“His answers were in my view, controlled and measured.”


	
	Then follows her Honour’s consideration. It is contained in the following four paragraphs:
	


“This matter relies essentially on an assessment of credit of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances of the interactions between the parties. The reference letter given to the real estate agent is an important issue in assessing credit. Mr Kumar asserts that he asked Mr Tanwar for a letter of reference in February 2009 as he was looking for a new rental property. His evidence was that Mr Tanwar prepared the reference letter, signed it and gave it to him in February 2009. He said he used this reference letter on several rental applications between February and July 2009.

He said he was renting a property at 3/69 St Ann Street, Merrylands for a period of three years until he moved to 101 Myall Street, Merrylands on 13 July 2009 and that he provided a copy of the reference letter to the real estate agency prior to his application for tenancy being accepted for the Myall Street property.

He denied that he made any alterations to the document. Mr Ghannoum said that he did not see any alterations or additions to the document from the real estate agency files from June 2009 which included a tenancy application for Mr Kumar. I am satisfied that the reference letter to confirm Mr Kumar’s employment signed by Mr Tanwar was dated 6 February 2009 and not 6 July 2009 as asserted by Mr Tanwar. I am satisfied that Mr Tanwar spoke to a representative of the real estate agent on 26 June 2009 and told them that Mr Kumar was a permanent fulltime taxi driver, earning $850 a week and that Mr Kumar had been employed for one year. These are plainly untruths.

I am satisfied that Mr Tanwar did not advance $2,000 to Mr Kumar on 6 July 2009. There is no evidence of how that figure was calculated, evidence of very poor bookkeeping practices and further that as the pay ins were Mr Tanwar’s bread and butter, it is totally improbable that he would have been prepared to advance $2,000 to a taxi driver who was in arrears and always in arrears with his pay ins.”


	
	The above review of her Honour’s judgment shows that she correctly held the proceedings were civil proceedings and that the standard of proof was on the balance of probabilities. The CIM specifically referred to s 140(2) of the Evidence Act and Briginshaw. These factors suggest that her Honour identified the appropriate standard. The appellant however challenges the application of that standard.
	
	
	The determination of that question requires analysis of her Honour’s reasons. Grounds (2), (3) and (6) of the appeal allege error on the basis that the reasons given were inadequate. It is convenient to deal with the latter issue first. I note that Ground (4), which alleges a denial of procedural fairness, is also related to the failure to give reasons.
	


Whether the CIM failed to give sufficient and adequate reasons


	
	It is now well accepted that the giving of reasons is an essential aspect of the judicial function: Wainohu v State of New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 at [54]-[59] per French CJ and Kiefel J and per Gummow, Hayne Crennan and Bell JJ at [92]-[94]. In particular French CJ and Kiefel J stated at [56] (Citations omitted):
	


“Gummow J in Grollo described the essential attributes of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in familiar terms by reference to the resolution of justiciable controversies by ascertainment of the facts, application of the law and the exercise where appropriate of judicial discretion, adding “which are delivered in public after a public hearing, and, where a judge is the tribunal of fact as well as law, are preceded by grounds for decision which are animated by reasoning.” Heydon J in AK v Western Australia described the duty of judges to give reasons for their decisions after trials and in important interlocutory proceedings as “well-established”. His Honour adopted as a summary of the objectives underlying that duty an extra-curial statement by Gleeson CJ:

‘First, the existence of an obligation to give reasons promotes good decision making. As a general rule, people who know that their decisions are open to scrutiny, and who are obliged to explain them, are more likely to make reasonable decisions. Secondly, the general acceptability of judicial decisions is promoted by the obligation to explain them. Thirdly, it is consistent with the idea of democratic institutional responsibility to the public that those who are entrusted with the power to make decisions, affecting the lives and property of their fellow citizens, should be required to give, in public, an account of the reasoning by which they came to those decisions.’

The duty does not apply to every interlocutory decision, however minor. Its content - that is, the content and detail of the reasons to be provided - will vary according to the nature of the jurisdiction which the court is exercising and the particular matter the subject of the decision.”


	
	Thus, although there is an obligation to give reasons, there is no single prescription of what constitutes adequate reasons. The instant case involved the determination of entitlements under an industrial instrument and the imposition of a civil penalty. The importance of these issues to the individuals and to the broader public indicate that the process of reasoning ought be clear and comprehensive at least in relation to the decisive issues in the case. That proposition is reinforced by the fact that the orders are subject to appeal.
	
	
	The decisive issue in this case, according to her Honour’s reasons, involved “an assessment of credit of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances of the interactions between the parties”. It appears her Honour resolved that issue by reference chiefly to the “reference letter”. I have noted what may be considered as comments by her Honour as to the demeanour of the appellant’s witnesses. There were no comments about the respondent’s witnesses. It may be inferred that these observations or absence of them played a role in the decision making: see Abalos v Australian Postal Commission [1990] HCA 47; (1990) 171 CLR 167 at 179.
	
	
	In considering this aspect I am mindful of the limitations of an appeal. It is timely to recall the words of Gleeson CJ in Fox v Percy. His Honour said at [23]-[24]:
	


“[23] … On the other, [the appellate court] must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the  “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.

[24] Nevertheless, mistakes, including serious mistakes, can occur at trial in the comprehension, recollection and evaluation of evidence. In part, it was to prevent and cure the miscarriages of justice that can arise from such mistakes that, in the nineteenth century, the general facility of appeal was introduced in England, and later in its colonies. Some time after this development came the gradual reduction in the number, and even the elimination, of civil trials by jury and the increase in trials by judge alone at the end of which the judge, who is subject to appeal, is obliged to give reasons for the decision. Such reasons are, at once, necessitated by the right of appeal and enhance its utility.”


	
	I should observe that the comment in relation to Mr Tanwar is not obviously critical. A description of a witness as “controlled and measured” may be regarded as a positive observation. Further the appellant submitted that it is difficult to make such an observation in a critical way when the witness was asked on numerous occasions to slow down in giving his evidence. At one point her Honour explained to the witness the issue as to the speed of his evidence in the following way:
	


“HER HONOUR

Q. It’s very difficult. I know it feels artificial, but I’ve got to write it down and I can’t keep up.

A. I understand. Sorry.”


	
	A further example came shortly after:
	


“HER HONOUR: Slow down. “Been. I’ve been trying—

JACKSON

Q. Maybe if I just see whether I can slow you down.

A. Bit difficult.

Q. Very difficult.

HER HONOUR

Q. This is the most important part, Mr Tanwar, so I’ll need to get everything down.

A. Yes, sure. Sure.

JACKSON

Q. Perhaps if you could actually tell her Honour rather than me.

A. Okay. I’ll – I’ll just slow down.

HER HONOUR

Then just stop each time you give a sentence so that I can catch up, and I’m sure Ms Wallis also needs to write it down.

A. Yes, sure.”


	
	There are many examples in the transcript of her Honour reminding the witness to slow down. That is not intended in any sense to be a criticism of her Honour who was diligently seeking to make accurate notes of the evidence. However, given those repeated instructions, one may accept that a witness who is attempting to comply may sound “controlled and measured”.
	
	
	Nevertheless, her Honour’s comment as to the statements made to the real estate representative as “plainly untruths” would seem to suggest that her earlier comment as to Mr Tanwar’s style of giving evidence was intended to be negative. I shall return to this consideration after reviewing the evidence of Mr Ghannoum.
	
	
	The observations as to the independence of Mrs Tanwar and, to the extent it may be implied, Ms Kaur that they were not “independent“ witnesses, is something that may obviously be said of Mr Kumar. As no such observation was made about him one must conclude that her Honour did not have regard to it. Her Honour does not seem to have had regard either, to the evidence of Mr Kumar that he relied on the reference letter in several applications to real estate agents, and thus willingly and knowingly made representations which were “plainly untruths”.
	
	
	There are several aspects to her Honour’s assessment of the evidence of the “reference letter”. There is the evidence of Mr Kumar, that of Mr Ghannoum and that of Mr Tanwar and Ms Kaur.
	
	
	It appears her Honour regarded Mr Ghannoum’s evidence as pivotal. His evidence therefore requires analysis. Before coming to that it is appropriate to review the evidence of Messrs Kumar and Tanwar and to do so in the context of some key dates.
	
	
	The bailment operated from 8 January to 26 June 2009. Mr Kumar moved house on 13 July 2009 having occupied his previous residence for about 3 years. The “reference letter”, which on Mr Kumar’s evidence was required to support his tenancy applications, was dated either 6/2/09 or 6/7/09. The only application to a real estate agent put into evidence was dated 25/6/09. Mr Kumar gave evidence that he gave notice to the agent for the St Ann Street property (his previous residence) “around about 13 June”. The application bears handwritten notes of what appear to be various telephone checks in relation to the application. One note dated “26/6” refers to a check of the employment details given by Mr Kumar. Mr Kumar’s evidence was that, after his final shift, he returned to Tanwar’s base only once in early July 2009.
	
	
	It is also helpful to be aware of the terms of the “reference letter”. The letter read as follows:
	


To Whom it may concern

Mr. Ranjeev Kumar of 3/69 St. Ann Street Merrylands 2160 is working with me as a full time taxi driving since six month. We are located at 281 New Canterbury Road Lewisham and my business name is Tanwar Petroleum. Mr Ranjeev’s weekly income is $850. If you have any question please feel free contact me on my mobile number [number given] or my business number 02 [number given].

Kind Regards

Ramesh Tanwar


	
	The cross-examination of Mr Kumar in relation to the letter was extensive. It was suggested that he wrote the letter and asked Mr Tanwar to sign it. He denied doing so. It was also suggested to him that he didn’t require the letter until July because it was at that time that he was seeking to move homes.
	
	
	In the course of the cross-examination, Mr Kumar said:
	


“Q. Now, when that document was prepared, it was actually - you actually wrote it for—

A. No, I didn’t wrote it.

Q. --Mr Tanwar to sign it; is that right?

A. No. No, I didn't wrote it. He did it by himself.

Q. You say you didn’t write it; you didn’t write that document?

A. No.

Q. You didn’t write that document and ask him to sign it?

A. No. I didn’t.

Q. If I suggest to you that you did, you'll say you didn’t; is that right?

A. Yeah

Q. But, nevertheless, the contents of the document, you checked that they were true and correct before you allowed Mr Tanwar to provide it to you?

A. No, he, he prepared it and signed it and gave it to me.

Q. But the information contained within it was accurate?

A. Think so yeah. Maybe that generally now I, I don't think that the information was accurate in there.

Q. I beg your pardon?

A. The information wasn’t accurate in there.

....

Q. What wasn’t accurate about the information?

A. The time I worked with him. He, he put it I worked for six months and I only worked for him for him a month, and so—

Q. Are you sure you are not anticipating what the problem is with the date you say you were given that letter?

A. What do you mean?

Q. Are you anticipating what the problem is? Because if the letter were, in fact, given to you in July 2009—

A. Mm-hmm.

Q. --then it wouldn't [sic] be correct to say that you’d worked for Mr Tanwar for six months, wouldn’t it?

…

Q. So you say, do you that you’d been working there for a month and that you ask the court to believe that Mr Tanwar wrote you a reference to say that you’d been working there for six months; is that right?

A. I was working there for a month and I ask him to do the letter for me and—

Q. And did you ask him—

A.—it’s what—

Q. -- to write six months?

A. No, I didn't ask him to write six months. I, I told him that I'm looking for a place to move because I, I need more room for my family.

Q. Did you ask him to correct the letter when you saw that it said that you’d been working there for six months?

A. I ask him. I said, “You put it six month.” And he said, “That’s how it goes.”

Q. Well, are you sure you’re not just making that up? I mean, that’s not something you told Ms Wallis.

A. I’m not making it up.

...

Q That’s not something you told Ms Wallis, is it?

…

Q. You didn’t tell Ms Wallis that you asked Mr Tanwar to correct the letter, but that Mr Tanwar for some reason wouldn’t do it; is that now your evidence?

A. I didn’t remember at that time. I remember now that I didn’t ask—

Q. Now you—

A. --him to do this for me.”


	
	Objectively, if the letter was written in July 2009 the contents were correct; if written in February 2009 they were incorrect. No suggestion was made as to Mr Tanwar’s motive for making a false representation in the letter. The evidence was he hadn’t met Mr Kumar until early January 2009 when Mr Kumar approached him for work driving a taxi.
	
	
	On the other hand Mr Kumar was cross-examined as to his motive for suggesting that the letter was written in February. Further cross-examination of Mr Kumar as to the emergence of the need for the letter was undertaken:
	


“Q. … On 13 July 2009 you moved to a new property.

A. Yes I did.

Q. You needed proof of employment and you needed a letter from your employer in order to obtain a lease on a new property on 13 July 2009; that’s correct, isn’t it?

A. I was looking for my property for a considerable time since February till July so—

Q. Well, that’s simply not true, is it?

A. It’s true.

Q. No.

A. It’s true.

Q. You’re just making it up.

A. I’m not making it up; it’s true.

Q. Well, I suggest to you that it’s just a pure fabrication and you know that it was in July 2009 that you needed a reference from Mr Tanwar as July –

A. No, I didn’t. I didn’t ask him the reference in July. I ask him in the February and that’s, that’s what the letter is all there. The other you got is fabricated by him.

Q. And the reason you think that – the reason you want to say that that letter was given to you in February 2009 and not July 2009 is because you want to deal with the fact that the only meeting you say happened in July 2009 was at Mr Tanwar’s request to talk about pay-ins. That’s the only reason you want to say that that letter was given to you in February and not July 2009?

A. That’s what you are saying and that’s what you are saying. That’s not the truth.”


	
	There is a real difficulty in understanding why Mr Tanwar would make such a misrepresentation for someone he barely knew and which appears could not benefit him in any way. In my view it was incumbent on her Honour to explain her reasons on this decisive issue. It is contended that it was a question of credit and her Honour possessed an advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses but, as I have noted, the comments as to credit or demeanour, such as they are, are hardly compelling and they do not in my view overcome or outweigh other significant considerations.
	
	
	Mr Tanwar gave his reasons for providing the reference in July 2009. He said Mr Kumar approached him and “begged” for his help. He said that Mr Kumar told him he needed to move house and to facilitate that he required a reference letter to supply to the estate agent. Mr Tanwar succumbed to his entreaties, not only to provide the letter but to give him an advance on his holiday pay to meet his rental bond in the amount of $2,000. He did these things notwithstanding that Mr Kumar was behind in his pay-ins and had not been in contact for about 10 days. He said it was a “business decision”. He wanted Mr Kumar to continue to hire his taxi in the hope that they would both make money. I note parenthetically that the “advance” in fact represented an estimate of Mr Kumar’s accrued entitlement according to the evidence of Mr Tanwar and Ms Kaur.
	
	
	No doubt there are aspects of the explanation which her Honour may have regarded with a degree of scepticism. Those matters were the subject of cross-examination. But, as was observed by the cross-examiner at the end of the cross-examination, the witness had “an explanation for everything”. Clearly her Honour did not regard all the explanations as convincing in that she found it improbable that Mr Tanwar would advance holiday pay when Mr Kumar was behind in his pay-ins. That view is no doubt shaped by her Honour’s assessment as to credibility. There is no analysis however, of what, in my view, was an unsatisfactory explanation offered by Mr Kumar as to the inaccuracy in the letter and his asserted attempt to correct it. Nor is there any apparent consideration of how Mr Kumar could, in good conscience, rely on the letter in several applications for tenancy between February and July 2009 knowing its contents not to be true.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Ghannoum then needs to be considered.
	
	
	The circumstances of the calling of Mr Ghannoum also need to be understood. As has been observed, Mr Kumar was cross examined about the “reference letter”. He was asked if he had the original. He said his solicitor had it. He also suggested that a copy could be obtained from LJ Hooker Parramatta or from Starr Partners who took over responsibility for the property to which he had moved. He was asked if he could obtain these various documents and he said he would try.
	
	
	When the proceedings resumed on 10 March 2014 Mr Kumar produced a bundle of documents said to have been obtained from the real estate agency. The prosecutor sought to tender those documents. The appellant objected and required the agent to attend to be examined about the documents. Mr Kumar gave some further evidence about the method of obtaining the documents. He was cross-examined and there were some unsatisfactory features of that evidence. He was asked:
	


“Q. You looked at the property, the agent probably said something like, “there are a number of people interested in this property,” something like that, and suggested you put in an application straight away, was that the sort of thing that happened?

A. Don’t remember. We went there, saw the property, they gave us the application, we filled it.

Q. You went from the property to the office?

A. No, they gave the application on the spot. They, they have applications at that time, they give it to you.

Q. So you filled out the application and handed it back to them at that point?

A. Handed or faxed

Q. Any documents that you weren’t able to provide at the time of application you provided prior to the application being approved?

A. Yeah, that’s the process. They look at everything then they approve you.

Q. So at some point, I want to suggest to you that the agent said to you that one of the documents that they required was a letter of employment.

A. Everything was together with the application.

Q. Well, I want to suggest to you that that’s not true, that you did not submit all of those documents on 25 June.

A. No, I did. I did, I gave all the documents on that day.”


	
	Then in re-examination he was asked:
	


“Q. My friend asked you some questions about when you provided the documents in the application form. Your response to one of those questions was, “Everything was together with the application”. What did you mean by that?

A. All the documents, electricity bill, bank statement, employment letter, payslips.

Q. It was all together with the application for tenancy?

A. Yep.

Q. When did you provide that to the real estate agent?

A. The day we put the application in.

Q. Was that the day you’d seen the property?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did you submit that application with the documents to them at the property, or did you visit them at the real estate?

A. Office, at the office.”


	
	Further cross examination was then permitted. Mr Kumar was asked:
	


“Q. Did you say you provided pay slips?

HER HONOUR: Yes, he did.

WITNESS: I said whatever was needed.

Q. You said you provided payslips. Did you say you provided payslips?

A. No, there was employment letter.

JACKSON: Did your Honour hear him—

HER HONOUR: Yes, I’ve written it down.

JACKSON

Q. Is there a reason you have removed those from the bundle you were given?

A. What bundle?

Q. The bundle from Parramatta Professionals?

A. No, I didn't move anything, I didn’t add anything to the application. The agent have the application. Can I ask him to bring it, compare with it?

Q. What documents did you actually ask for from the agent?

A. My document, the application form.

Q. And attachments?

A. Yeah.

...

Q. You don’t know why the payslips didn’t form part of the bundle you were given?

A. Payslips?

Q. Yes

A. I didn’t have payslips at that time. What payslips are we talking about?

Q. Well, apparently that’s what you said—

A. Taxi drivers don’t get any payslips.

Q. We’ve heard this before, Mr Kumar.”


	
	As I have earlier noted, Mr Kumar denied receiving any documents from Tanwar including tax invoices evidencing pay-ins. His evidence as to payslips was inconsistent with those denials. That was one unsatisfactory element. Perhaps more important was the ease with which Mr Kumar shifted ground in relation to where and when he completed the application form and, even more importantly, where and when he provided the supporting documents.
	
	
	The latter included the “reference letter”. It was important to Mr Kumar that he show the letter was in existence prior to 6 July 2009. If he had provided it to the agent on 25 June 2009 it must have been in existence prior to that date. Equally for Tanwar, its case was the letter was required for the purpose of this application. The lease did not commence until 13 July 2009 and the letter was signed by Mr Tanwar on 6 July 2009. It is consistent with that case that the letter was provided between the date of the application and the approval or execution of the lease.
	
	
	The agent Mr Ghannoum was called the following day. He confirmed that the documents produced the day before were those provided by his office. He said they were copies because the originals had to be passed to another agent when management of the property changed. He confirmed that he was not the agent who took Mr Kumar’s application or completed any of the checks. He was asked to say when the “ticks” on the document, indicating the provision of supporting documents, were inserted. As to that he said:
	


“A. Look, as soon as we’ve received the document, which is usually on submission, we usually don’t accept applications without submissions of at least you know, the – the documents that we request. There is, for example, like, like, a tenancy reference letter or a rental ledger, sometimes we don’t get them submitted immediately due to the fact that, you know, by the time they go to the agent and then submit it. So we usually just call the agent, send the declaration through, and they fax over those documents to us, or email them to us, sorry.

Q. So what you are saying is that this application would not have been accepted without those documents.

A. That’s correct.”


	
	The difficulty I have with this last response is that it is not at all clear what is meant by “those documents”. It would seem to me that he is referring to the “tenancy reference letter” and “rental ledger”. It is equally unclear what is meant by the application being “accepted”. Does it mean received or approved? Moreover, Mr Ghannoum’s evidence indicates that supporting documents are “usually” provided on submission of the application. It follows that is not a universal practice. That was confirmed in cross examination.
	
	
	Mr Jackson asked:
	


“Q. That when you take an application for tenancy—

A. Yeah

Q. –and its filled out and the employer’s phone number is included in the application—

A. Yes

Q. --and obviously the tenant authorises you to contact the employer—

A. Yep. Yes.

Q. –you might at that stage, at the point of the application, for the sake of, as you say, because you want to deal with the matter expediently—

A. Yep

Q.—you might accept verbal confirmation on the point.

A. Correct, yep.

Q. It’s possible isn’t it? I’m only asking you to consider what’s possible.

A. Yeah

Q. It’s possible also, isn’t it, that a landlord – the landlord is your client – the landlord might say, “I’d be more comfortable or I’d be happy if you could obtain a written reference,’ that’s a possibility?

A. Yeah, I mean, it could be, but it’s just – every scenario’s different so it’s a possibility, but yeah, it could be, I couldn’t say why it wouldn’t be.”


	
	So Mr Ghannoum’s evidence is simply to confirm the documents produced come from the agency’s records. He was not the person who made the relevant checks or received the various documents. In the end his evidence as to practice is that every scenario is different. It follows that the documents produced are consistent with both the case for the prosecutor and the case for the respondent because they simply don’t say at what date the “reference letter” was provided.
	
	
	There is another aspect that emerges from these documents which was apparently not considered by her Honour. The “untruths” told to the real estate agent were told, without doubt, by Mr Kumar. He wrote them in his tenancy application. Indeed on his evidence even the listing of Tanwar as the “employer’ was inaccurate, not because of the legal nature of the relationship but because, as at that date, Mr Kumar had decided not to work with the appellant any longer and had found alternative work. None of these “untruths” were expressed to tell against the credit of Mr Kumar. Nor were any reasons given which explained why they were not significant.
	
	
	Mr Tanwar said that he was surprised to hear the evidence as to the employment reference check recorded in the document. He accepted that his name was Ramesh but said that he had no recollection of such a phone call. Moreover, he said he does not describe himself as “manager” but as “owner” or “director”. The contention then, that he made such representations, is dependent on challenged hearsay evidence. Moreover, in contrast to Mr Kumar, Mr Tanwar’s evidence was that he had expected Mr Kumar to resume work once he had moved house. In other words he did not know that Mr Kumar no longer worked with the appellant.
	
	
	A further point of interest emerging from the documents is that Mr Kumar was required to pay, and paid, a bond, rent in advance and an agreement fee totalling $1,995. That is very close to the $2,000 which Mr Tanwar said Mr Kumar sought from him for his bond. True it included only $1,320 for the bond and the amount was paid prior to the date that Mr Tanwar says was the date of their conversation but, if no such conversation occurred, as was Mr Kumar’s evidence, Mr Tanwar appears to have been extremely lucky in the figure he chose as the amount requested and said to have been advanced.
	
	
	Finally, this was not a simple case of one person’s evidence being preferred over another. Mr Tanwar’s evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Ms Kaur and Mrs Tanwar.
	
	
	Mrs Tanwar said that Ms Kaur came to her on 6 July 2009 and asked for $2,000 cash for “Ranjeev for advance holiday pay”. She took the cash from the till, counted it, and gave it to Ms Kaur who also counted it. Mrs Tanwar then made a note of the “cash out” in her daily reconciliation or sale register. That document was tendered.
	
	
	Ms Kaur’s evidence was that she had telephoned Mr Kumar about his outstanding pay-ins. He came to Tanwar’s premises on 6 July 2009. Mr Kumar and Mr Tanwar had a conversation in her presence. She said Mr Kumar produced the reference letter and asked Mr Tanwar to sign it. He also asked for some financial assistance. Mr Tanwar asked her how long Mr Kumar had been working with them. She said about 6 months. Mr Tanwar directed her to give him $2,000 as advance holiday pay. She reminded Mr Tanwar of Mr Kumar’s outstanding pay-ins, but Mr Kumar said he would resolve that soon and Mr Tanwar directed her to pay him.
	
	
	Ms Kaur said she then went to Mrs Tanwar, who was working on the counter in the service station, and asked her for the cash. She gave evidence which was consistent with Mrs Tanwar about recording the reason for the “cash out” in the daily reconciliation. She then returned, gave the money to Mr Kumar and, after asking him to count it and having made a copy of the “reference letter” signed by Mr Tanwar, she made a note on it of the payment in advance of holiday pay.
	
	
	The appellant submitted, and I accept, that in order to find the defendant guilty of the offence, her Honour really had to do more than skirt around that evidence; it really must have been a concocted fabrication of lies between three people who were deliberately perjuring themselves, and not only that, had concocted documents to support their perjury. The defendant in the proceedings below submitted:
	


“If you are to accept Mr Kumar’s evidence on the critical question of whether the $2,000 advance on his holiday pay was made, you would have to find that,

1) Shirley Tanwar has lied on oath to the court.

2) Shirley Tanwar has manufactured and provided a false business record to the court (the cash balance sheet);

3) Both Ramesh Tanwar and Gurpreet Kaur have lied on oath to the court;

4) Gurpreet doctored a business record tendered to the court and lied about having done so in her evidence (the letter of employment) when she has added a purported contemporaneous file note to the letter.

All of these findings are very serious findings, and the court would require a very high degree of satisfaction, taking into account the caution with which such findings should be made (Briginshaw). As the Plaintiff says in his written submissions, clear, cogent, or strict proof is necessary (Neat Holdings Pty Ltd).”


	
	Findings of such gravity need to be fully explained in the court’s reasons. They are not the kind of findings which may be inferred or which are implicit in the short observations as to credit of the appellant’s witnesses. Had this been a case in which the court was faced with competing evidence one on one then, of course it is necessary to determine which is to be preferred. But in this instance there is corroborating testimony from two other witnesses and contemporaneous records which also had to be fabricated in some way. In particular, the adjustment of the reconciliation sheet to record the payment would have been a very elaborate ruse to undertake.
	
	
	In my view, her Honour has failed to provide adequate reasons and has therefore fallen into error.
	


Application of the Standard of Proof


	
	On the analysis of the CIM’s reasons I am also satisfied that her Honour has not applied s 140(2) of the Evidence Act correctly. 
	
	
	The rejection of the appellant’s case required very serious findings going to the character and credit of the appellant’s witnesses. The totality of the evidence does not permit those findings. The criticisms made against each of the appellant’s witnesses were open to be made against Mr Kumar. He certainly can’t be said to be independent. He was very dogmatic about aspects of his evidence (but was conveniently flexible about other aspects), and he was the propagator of the “blatant untruths” for which Mr Tanwar was exclusively held accountable.
	
	
	I accept there were some apparent inconsistencies which emerged particularly in cross-examination of the witnesses. Many of these were explicable by the fact that the witness box was an unfamiliar place for them and that English was clearly a second language for all of them. They each appeared to have a reasonable command of the language but each of the witnesses presented difficulties related to the speed of their speaking exacerbated by (it appears from the transcript) their accents. On many occasions the witnesses and I include Mr Kumar, were asked to slow down by the advocates or the court or were interrupted in their answers because they could not be understood. Such circumstances, which are of nobody’s making, can cause difficulties for the assessment of the evidence of the witnesses. They can also cause difficulties for the witness. For example, a witness who may be embarrassed that their answer is not clear may too readily accept a reformulation (genuinely offered) by the questioner.
	
	
	Due allowance needs to be made for these sorts of factors when assessing apparent inconsistencies in the evidence. I acknowledge the added advantage the trial court does have of seeing and hearing the witnesses: Fox v Percy. The inadequacy of the reasons, which I have found, does not reveal how or whether that advantage was used. In my assessment of the evidence I have sought to make due allowance for these considerations.
	


Disposition of the appeal


	
	It follows from these findings of error that the appeal against the orders of the CIM should be allowed. As this is an appeal by rehearing the next question is whether I should proceed to determine the matter myself or, as s 197(4) of the IR Act permits, refer the matter back to the CIM’s Court. The parties submitted I should determine the matter. In all the circumstances, including the lapse of time, the amount in issue and the question of costs I accept that I should proceed to determine the matter.
	
	
	In analysing the adequacy of the CIM’s reasons I have referred to much of the evidence of significance to the determination of this issue. In particular:
	



	
	The evidence of Mr Tanwar and Ms Kaur as to handing Mr Kumar $2,000 in respect of annual leave;
	
	
	The evidence of the contemporaneous note of that payment by Ms Kaur;
	
	
	The evidence of Mrs Tanwar as to giving Ms Kaur $2,000 for holiday pay for Mr Kumar;
	
	
	The evidence of her entry into the daily business reconciliation sheet of that amount and the reason for it;
	
	
	The evidence of that business record.
	



	
	All of this evidence points directly to the satisfaction of the entitlement to the accrued holiday pay. Against that is the denial by Mr Kumar of having received that amount. I have noted above a number of misgivings I have about the credibility of Mr Kumar. The prosecutor submits however that his evidence is corroborated, in a negative sense, by the “reference letter”. I say in a negative sense because the letter, absent the notation made by Ms Kaur, makes no reference to annual holiday pay. In the prosecutor’s case it is important because it casts doubt on the credit of the appellant’s witnesses.
	
	
	I have noted the issue as to the date of the letter. The appellant did not and does not suggest, as I understand it, that Mr Kumar altered the date on the letter. The key issue was whether the number of the month should be read as a “2” or a “7”. Mr Tanwar said he wrote the date. Towards the end of his cross-examination he was shown two versions of the letter, one with Ms Kaur’s annotation and one without, Exhibits 3 and 8 respectively. Exhibit 8 also had a finger print or hand print ink smudge. He gave an explanation of how that came to be on the version which was Exhibit 8. The cross–examination then continued:
	


“Q. Did you put the ink there?

A. No.

Q. Are you trying to cover up the date from the second to the seventh?

A. No.

Q. Because the original doesn’t contain that date, does it?

A. Same date. What do you mean doesn’t contain same date?

Q. The original doesn’t contain the ink smudge mark.

A. Yes, it doesn’t, no. But this is not the original. Is it original?

Q. That’s the original?

A. Is it?

Q. Exhibit 3. So you say the date on the reference letter is July?

A. Yes.

Q. That was your earlier evidence?

A. Yes.

Q. It’s actually February, isn’t it?

A. No. No.

Q. How do you explain the reason why it looks like a two?

A. Well, that’s the – I was explaining before, I write the seven with the stroke in between, and when I was writing, I was writing, maybe leaning something and the stroke gone to the middle gone to the bottom and that’s the way I do seven.

…

Q. The truth is that you actually signed that document in February, wasn’t it?

A. I said no, and I don’t - I do it like this, I write two very differently.


	
	Mr Tanwar’s reference to “earlier” was to his examination in chief. At that time he said he was sure it was a seven. He gave the same explanation as to how he writes a “7” with a line through the middle. He said he was writing hurriedly and suggested, although he didn’t remember, that he was leaning on something and that caused his line to be at the bottom. A review of the document does not suggest the explanation is implausible.
	
	
	It is also inconsistent with the concept of a carefully constructed fiction that the witnesses have concocted, that they would choose to write on an otherwise totally irrelevant document, a note as to the payment. What would be the point of such an elaboration? They had the reconciliation sheet and the evidence of three witnesses.
	
	
	I am inclined to accept Mr Tanwar’s explanation. It is consistent with the evidence of Ms Kaur as to the date the letter came into existence. I have noted above the evidence of Mr Ghannoum and the documents produced by the real estate agency do not contradict that finding.
	
	
	In the result I find that on 6 July 2009 the appellant made a payment of $2,000 to Mr Kumar in respect of accrued holiday pay. That payment was more than enough to satisfy the entitlement under the Determination.
	
	
	It follows that I dismiss the application for a civil penalty and the claim for recovery.
	


Costs


	
	The appellant acknowledged that costs were only available against the respondent if “they’ve acted in some way inappropriately and I don’t say that.” As a result costs were not sought.
	


Orders


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	



	
	If leave to appeal is required, leave is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is upheld.
	
	
	The orders of Magistrate Goodwin sitting as the Chief Industrial Magistrate are set aside.
	
	
	The proceedings in the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court are dismissed.
	
	
	No order as to costs.

		13 April 2016",2015-07-20 00:00:00,NSW Industrial Court
2703053,R v Boyd [2015] NSWSC 1065,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	This is a release application under the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) as amended by the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW). The 2014 amendments are particularly important in a consideration of this application because of the provisions in s 16A which provides a show cause requirement in certain situations, certain offences and in certain circumstances.
	
	
	The issues that arise on this application are first, whether or not the applicant has shown cause why his continued detention is not justified and assuming persuades me of that matter, whether or not there are unacceptable risks of the kind referred to in s 19, namely; that he will fail to appear, commit serious offences, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	Ms Campagna, who appears for the applicant, has presented a compelling case on both of those issues. The Crown, represented by Mr Curran, opposes the grant of bail and points to the facts of the current offences, the criminal history of the applicant and submits that he has not shown cause.
	
	
	However, having heard the evidence and submissions, Mr Curran took an appropriately restrained approach to making those submissions. However, he maintains the Crown’s position.
	
	
	I have come to the conclusion that the applicant has shown cause why his continued detention is not justified and I have also concluded that the conditions proposed by Ms Campagna are such as to alleviate the bail concerns that I do have. These are my reasons for those conclusions.
	
	
	The applicant stands charged with a number of extremely serious offences under ss 33, 35 and 93(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Those offences were allegedly committed on 22 February 2015. At that time the applicant was on parole in relation to an offence for which he was sentenced in 2011 and which occurred in 2009. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an application for leave to appeal against sentence in 2012.
	
	
	As a result of the timing of the present alleged offences he was on parole and therefore s 16B(1)(h) provides that he must show cause why his detention is not justified.
	
	
	Further, as a result, he is currently back in custody serving the balance of parole on that sentence which is not due to expire as I understand it until 22 November 2015. However, there is a parole review hearing on 24 July 2015.
	
	
	Nothing that I may say in these reasons should be interpreted by the Parole Authority as being relevant to the job that it has to do and whether or not he is ultimately released prior to the end of his parole period will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	The facts of the alleged offences for which bail has been to this point refused are, as I have said, extremely serious in their nature. They involve what might be described as vigilante activity on the part of the applicant and others or, on a less benign view, acts of revenge as a result of crimes committed by or at least allegedly committed by the ultimate victims of the offences.
	
	
	Early in the morning of 22 February 2015 there was an aggravated break and enter offence committed at premised in Bowen Mountain Road, Bowen Mountain. That was the home of the co-accused and as a result the co-accused, a Mr Abrahams, and the applicant sought to establish who was responsible and, having established who they believed was responsible, set about finding them and extracting revenge in a most gruesome way.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to go through all of the details but ultimately the victim, Mr Wilson-Hore, who is alleged to be perpetrator of the break and enter, was located. He was forced to the ground, he was punched repeatedly and he was stomped on the head by the applicant.
	
	
	The assault thus inflicted was an extremely brutal one and, if accepted, a rather cowardly one. It resulted in extremely serious injuries, the extent of which are not presently known but which did involve serious brain injury, such that the victim was admitted to Westmead Hospital where, at least at the time of the production of the statement of facts before me, remained in a medically induced coma.
	
	
	At some point during the course of the attempt to locate the perpetrators of the break and enter the applicant pretended to be a detective, stopping cars in the middle of public places for that purpose. There is said to be CCTV footage which depicts the applicant attempting to grab another alleged perpetrator of the break and enter from a car or taxi. It needs hardly be said that that represents extremely serious criminality.
	
	
	In addition, the applicant has what can only be described as an appalling criminal history. I will not go through it but there are a number of previous offences of violence as well as a number of earlier breaches of bail and failures to appear. There are many crimes of dishonesty and ironically enough, given the context in which this application is made, the matter for which he is currently serving the balance of parole was itself an aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence. In relation to that matter he was sentenced to 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.
	
	
	As I said in the course of argument when the application was being pursued, there is a disconnection between those facts, that criminal record and the material (exhibit 1) tendered on behalf the applicant. That material consists of a letter from Ms Cilla Lavender, who is the partner of the applicant, along with a letter from his mother and an extensive resume showing the applicant’s qualifications in electrical fitting and his extensive and impressive academic record and employment record. It is very difficult to reconcile that material with the material in the criminal history.
	
	
	In addition to the material to which I have referred, there are also letters from a Tony Dunn, who is a crime prevention and rehabilitation therapist, who has known the applicant for many years and describes him as a decent and compassionate individual who is however, under extreme pressure, capable of irrational and detrimental decisions. Mr Dunn has indicated a preparedness to assist the applicant in his rehabilitation by providing him with counselling.
	
	
	Ms Campagna puts to me a combination of factors which she says satisfies the requirements of s 16A, that is to say, shows cause why the applicant’s detention is not justified.
	
	
	I accept that a combination of factors may constitute satisfaction of the show cause requirement and I refer to the decision of R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499 where Johnson J held that exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of bail in a murder case could be established or achieved by reference to a combination of factors. There does not have to be just one particular aspect of the case.
	
	
	Ms Campagna refers to the fact that the applicant strenuously denies the charges, that he is presumed to be innocent and, most cogently, that there will be an extremely lengthy delay between the time of this application and the time that he comes to be able to test the prosecution case at trial.
	
	
	At this stage most, if not all, of the prosecution brief has been served and it is to be replied to in August of this year. However, Ms Campagna’s inquiries suggest that it is unlikely that there will be any trial date until 2016. My understanding of the trial lists in Western Sydney confirms that that is indeed likely.
	
	
	The words of Sperling J in R v Cain (2001) 121 A Crim R 365 at 367 maintain their resonance under the current bail regime. His Honour said this:
	


“As to the interests of the applicant, he has a legitimate claim to be at liberty to go about a lawful life and to be with his family pending trial. He has been in custody for over a year. I am told by the Crown that the present charges might not come to trial for a further year. The prospect that a private citizen who has not been convicted of any offence might be imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is, absent exceptional circumstances, not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights.”


	
	Ms Campagna then refers to the complexity of the likely issues in the trial and the fact that a large part of the prosecution case will be dependent on the evidence of an informer who was, on the Crown’s own case, a co-accused or co-offender.
	
	
	He, that is to say, the applicant is currently in custody at the North Coast Correctional Centre at Kempsey, whereas his proposed legal team is in either Parramatta or the Lower Blue Mountains, such that his being involved in the preparation for this complex trial is extremely difficult.
	
	
	Ms Campagna then relies on his family circumstances and his community support. She refers to the fact that he has four children aged 17, 14, 9 and 5, that he is qualified as an electrical fitter with an excellent employment history and good prospects of obtaining work. She also refers to the possibility that he will be able to receive counselling by Mr Dunn.
	
	
	I am satisfied on all of that material and with the combination of circumstances that the applicant has shown cause why his detention is not justified. It is established that that question is to be considered separately and not conflated with the question of whether or not there are bail concerns and unacceptable risks for the purposes of ss 17 and 19 of the Act, although it has also been held that the facts and material relevant to one question might also be relevant to the other: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	
	
	Because of the criminal history including the record, albeit somewhat historic now, of failing to appear and the frequency of offences over many years, I do have bail concerns pursuant to s 17 and, in particular, concerns that the applicant will fail to appear, commit serious offences or endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community.
	
	
	The bail conditions that have been proposed are extremely stringent and when taken in combination with the involvement of Mr Dunn, I am satisfied that those concerns are alleviated to such a degree that there is no unacceptable risk of the matters to which I have referred.
	
	
	In coming to that conclusion I have taken into account the matters referred to in the exhaustive list of factors in s 18. I have considered his excellent community ties but also his appalling criminal history; I have considered the nature and seriousness of the offence; I have, insofar as I can, considered the strength of the prosecution case and his history of violence.
	
	
	I have considered the other matters referred to in the following paragraphs of s 18, but in view of the time and busyness of the list I won’t go through all of them now. He does have a need to be free for other lawful reasons, namely, caring for his young family and providing for them, as well as a need for him to be free to prepare for his appearance in court and obtaining legal advice.
	
	
	A very significant factor is that in sub section (h) which is to say, the length of time he is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused. It is also the fact of course that if he is convicted of this offence a lengthy period of imprisonment is virtually inevitable.
	
	
	I have taken all of the matters that arise under s 18 into account in coming to my conclusion that there is not an unacceptable risk and for that reason bail will be granted on the following conditions.
	



	
	To be of good behaviour.
	
	
	To report to Windsor Police Station daily between the hours of 9am and 5pm.
	
	
	To live at [REDACTED].
	
	
	To appear at Penrith Local Court on 14 August 2015 and on such date thereafter as required.
	
	
	Not to drink alcohol or enter any premises in which alcohol is sold.
	
	
	Not to take any illegal or prescription drugs (other than a drug prescribed to the applicant by a doctor).
	
	
	Not to associate or communicate by any means (except through his/her lawyer) with Joe Bee Abrahams and Matthew Anderson.
	
	
	The applicant is not to be absent from the address at which he/she is required to live between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am.
	
	
	Not to have any contact in any way (except through a legal representative) with any person identified as a prosecution witness brief including but not limited to [REDACTED].
	
	
	To attend counselling sessions with Tony Dunn once or twice weekly as required by Mr Dunn.
	
	
	The applicant is to deposit $ 2000 and agree to forfeit it if he fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	To present him at the front door at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.
	
	
	To undertake any testing at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the drug/alcohol abstention condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that the applicant may have consumed drugs/alcohol in breach of the bail acknowledgment. Such testing may only be non-invasive and carried out with respect given to the applicant’s privacy.

2703057,R v Castaneda [2015] NSWSC 964,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: Yesterday on 13 July 2015 the accused was arraigned on a charge that on 23 February 2013 at Cecil Hills in this State she murdered Gregory Peck.
	
	
	The Court has today received evidence on the voir dire to resolve issues of admissibility of evidence sought to be led by one of the parties, which is objected to by the other party. The evidence in each case is from a witness who is resident in the United States of America and who is unavailable as a witness in this jurisdiction.
	
	
	The accused seeks to lead evidence from Cassandra Lucas. The Crown seeks to lead evidence from Stephanie Seracco. There is an additional piece of evidence sought to be tendered by the accused referred to as the “Invacare evidence”.
	


   The Lucas evidence


	
	Tendered by the accused on the voir dire was a series of electronic communications in hard copy form between the accused and Cassandra Lucas in March 2010, which annex other electronic communications between the deceased and Ms Lucas which were sent between December 2008 and April 2009. Those documents are exhibits F, G, H and J on the voir dire.
	
	
	The communication trail establishes that the deceased and Ms Lucas were involved in a relationship together in the period before the deceased came to live and work in Australia. They had lived together for a period of two or so years and there was at least initially, some prospect that Ms Lucas would join the deceased in Australia.
	
	
	Although they maintained communication into 2009, Ms Lucas did not in fact travel to Australia, and the relationship ended. There appears to have been a period of some months, perhaps six or so months, when the deceased was both involved with the accused in Australia and in communication with Ms Lucas in the United States with a view to rekindling his relationship with her.
	
	
	In March 2010 the accused contacted Ms Lucas electronically with a view to seeking information from her about the deceased. Although Ms Lucas was initially unwilling to communicate with the accused, she eventually did exchange messages with her via email and Facebook about her relationship with the deceased. The accused seeks to adduce the evidence of the email and Facebook trail to do a number of things.
	
	
	The evidence is said to be relevant to the issue of self-defence.
	
	
	It is contended that the evidence is capable additionally of establishing that the deceased had a tendency to be violent, particularly when affected by alcohol, with women with whom he was involved in a relationship, and that the evidence should be admitted pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	It is additionally contended that the evidence is capable of rebutting evidence that may be led in the Crown case to the effect that the accused was possessive and jealous and irrational in her conduct to and connected with the deceased.
	
	
	The accused further argues that the evidence is relevant to a proper assessment of the credibility of the deceased’s account of his relationship with the accused in that it is capable of establishing that he was a less than reliable historian, particularly in matters connected to his relationship with the accused.
	
	
	Finally, the accused suggests that the evidence is capable of supporting the credit of the accused and of making it more probable that the account that she gave to a Triple 0 operator, and thereafter to police, of the deceased attacking her prior to the stabbing which resulted in the deceased’s death, is true.
	
	
	The Crown objects to any of this evidence being adduced.
	
	
	The Court was referred to three decisions from Victoria and South Australia, being: Re Knowles [1984] VR 751; R v PP [2002] VSC 523; (2002) 135 A Crim R 575; R v Hajistassi [2010] SASC 111.
	
	
	I have additionally had regard to two decisions from New South Wales, both from the Court of Criminal Appeal, being: R v Cakovski [2004] NSWCCA 280; (2004) 149 A Crim R 21 and Elias v R [2006] NSWCCA 365.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties I have concluded that some but not all of the evidence deriving from Ms Lucas is admissible.
	
	
	It seems to me that what is of relevance here is not the trail of communications per se, being communications in which Ms Lucas expresses her opinions of the deceased and portrays him in a less than favourable light, but the fact of what she communicated to the accused in March 2010, that being that:
	



	
	the deceased was violent and aggressive when drunk;
	
	
	that he had on one occasion dragged Ms Lucas across the floor by her hair during the course of an argument;
	
	
	that he had on one occasion locked her out of the house when she was not dressed; and
	
	
	that he had been verbally abusive to Ms Lucas during the course of their relationship.
	



	
	Evidence that Ms Lucas told the accused these things about the deceased is in my view relevant to the issue of self-defence which is, it seems to me, the only real issue in the trial.
	
	
	The accused’s case is summed-up to a degree by her comment to a Triple 0 operator immediately after the deceased was stabbed, and by her account of the stabbing to the police officers who attended the scene at first instance, that material being before the Court as part of the Crown case statement.
	
	
	That account is, in brief, that during an argument the deceased moved to hit the accused and, having obtained a knife, the accused stabbed the deceased believing that that action was necessary in her own defence.
	
	
	Consideration of whether the Crown has proved its case to the requisite standard by negativing the issue of self-defence will include an assessment by the jury of the state of mind of the accused at the relevant time.
	
	
	Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused believed her conduct was necessary in her own defence?
	
	
	If there is, is there a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances, the circumstances being as the accused perceived them to be?
	
	
	The information given to the accused by Ms Lucas is relevant to both questions in my view.
	
	
	The first of the questions involves an assessment of the accused’s state of mind, that being a wholly subjective consideration. The second, whilst the reasonableness of the response of the accused is to be assessed objectively, the question of the circumstances as she perceived them to be contains a further subjective element that falls to be assessed.
	
	
	That the accused had been told by a former partner of the deceased that he was violent when drunk and had in fact been violent and abusive to her, that is Ms Lucas, is evidence capable of informing the assessment of the subjective aspects of self-defence. It is therefore relevant and admissible.
	
	
	I do not regard the temporal lapse between the recounted events and the stabbing as significant in these circumstances.
	
	
	The evidence however is not admissible in the present form of the email and Facebook communications. It may be that it can be led by way of a s 191 agreed statement of fact; through questions directed to the police officer in charge of the investigation; or, by way of tender of the relevant transcript from the committal hearing; but the document trail itself contains much which is inadmissible and it cannot be admitted in that form.
	
	
	If led to support the credibility of the accused’s account of the stabbing, the evidence must additionally be categorised as tendency evidence.
	
	
	I have had regard to the provisions of s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 which refers to the requirement for notice.
	
	
	Although no evidence has been led as to notice given to the Crown by the accused, I infer that s 97(1)(a) has not been complied with. Despite that, and quite properly in the circumstances of this case, where the Crown had until very recently proposed to lead the evidence of Ms Lucas itself, no issue was taken by the Crown with the lack of notice. The Court may, pursuant to s 100 of the Evidence Act 1995, dispense with the requirements for notice, and insofar as that is necessary I do so.
	
	
	Evidence of the deceased’s character, reputation or conduct, or a tendency to act in a violent manner towards female partners when intoxicated is not admissible unless, having regard to the evidence to be adduced by the accused, the Court thinks the evidence will have significant probative value.
	
	
	In circumstances where the accused’s case is to be one of self-defence, in my view the evidence of the deceased’s character and reputation, and of his conduct towards Ms Lucas and the tendency to violence that that conduct is capable of establishing, will have significant probative value. The requirements of s.97 are thus met.
	
	
	I have considered in reaching that conclusion the many authorities on the meaning of significant probative value. ""Probative value"" as defined in the Dictionary of the Act means ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"". That is, the extent to which the evidence is relevant. ""Significant"" has been held to mean ""more than mere relevance"", but less than a ""substantial"" relevance. It also must be ""important"" and ""of consequence"": R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457; R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356. This formulation has been endorsed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in DSJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 84 NSWLR 758 at [60] as the correct approach in relation to “significant probative value” as it applies to s 97 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It is noted that s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 does not apply in these circumstances because the tendency evidence that is sought to be adduced does not relate to any purported tendency the accused may have.
	
	
	The evidence of what Ms Lucas said the deceased did to her (particularly when affected by alcohol) having met the test set out by s 97, is additionally admissible as tendency evidence.
	
	
	Once admitted, the jury may use the evidence derived from Ms Lucas to assist it to assess the question of whether the Crown has negatived self-defence. It is clearly relevant to that assessment.
	
	
	The evidence admitted on these bases may be further admissible pursuant to s 108A of the Evidence Act 1995 as the accused contends, but it seems to me that it is premature to decide that issue at this stage, before the detail of the Crown case and any evidence to be led of representations made by the deceased concerning the accused, is known. It is similarly premature to determine the question of whether the evidence is available to rebut aspects of the Crown case. That will depend upon the evidence led by the Crown before the jury. These issues can be reconsidered later in the proceedings if necessary.
	


The Invacare evidence


	
	It is convenient to deal with that evidence here in that it is further evidence sought to be led by the accused as relevant to an assessment of the deceased’s credibility as an historian.
	
	
	Exhibit K is a series of documents concerning purported misconduct by the deceased in the course of his employment in late 2008. The relevance of the material is said to be to demonstrate the deceased’s unreliability as an historian, with that unreliability said to extend to the deceased’s account to others of his relationship with the accused.
	
	
	In email exchanges with Ms Lucas in April 2009, which is part of exhibit F on the voir dire, the deceased told Ms Lucas that his employment in Australia had been “cancelled” before it began because of (what I take to be a reference to) the global recession. The deceased complained in that email to Ms Lucas of impecuniosity, to the point where he was homeless.
	
	
	The contents of exhibit K, being the Invacare evidence, make it clear that the deceased’s account of his circumstances was false. The accused contends that the evidence in exhibit K, coupled with that in exhibit F, demonstrates that the deceased was not someone whose accounts of his personal circumstances should be accepted.
	
	
	I have already ruled that exhibits F, G, H and J are not admissible in their present form; that is by tender of the emails and Facebook printouts themselves. It is not the messages that are relevant, but the information conveyed to the accused about the deceased’s former violence to Ms Lucas and the nature of that purported violence. Accordingly, the email concerning the deceased’s unemployment and the circumstances and consequences of it is not of itself relevant.
	
	
	There is thus no need to adduce the evidence contained in exhibit K to demonstrate that the account given in exhibit F by the deceased is a lie.
	
	
	This evidence really amounts to no more than evidence of bad character, which is led to establish that the deceased was not a person to be believed; that is, that he was a person lacking in credit. That sort of evidence is not ordinarily admissible.
	
	
	Section 102 of Part 3.7 of the Evidence Act 1995 applies. Although the deceased is not a witness as referred to in s 101A, he is in my view what is referred to in that section as an “other person”, and so the provisions of the Evidence Act with respect to credit apply to accounts of potentially relevant matters purportedly given by the deceased to others. As a consequence, evidence going to the deceased’s credit is not of itself admissible.
	
	
	It may be that the Invacare evidence becomes relevant because of some feature of the Crown case when it is called before the jury. At this stage, however, I am not persuaded that it falls within any relevant exception to the credibility rule and I decline to admit the Invacare evidence.
	


The Seracco Evidence


	
	The final piece of disputed evidence is that sought to be adduced by the Crown, being the evidence of Stephanie Seracco.
	
	
	Ms Seracco, like Ms Lucas, is a resident of the United States of America. She first met the deceased in 1998 and, as a friend, maintained contact with him until very shortly before his death. In a statement, which is exhibit E on the voir dire, Ms Seracco refers to a conversation that she had on the telephone with the deceased in March 2011.
	
	
	At [13] of her statement, Ms Seracco says that on an evening in March 2011 she received an incoming call from the deceased and, in the subsequent conversation she had with him, he told her about an incident which had just transpired. The material parts of the conversation are that, at that time, March 2011:
	



	
	the deceased told Ms Seracco that he had been involved in a fight where there was a bottle thrown and some glass broken;
	
	
	that the fight was between he and the accused and both had been drinking; and
	
	
	that both the deceased and the accused had “put their hands on each other during the fight”.
	



	
	As that recitation makes plain, Ms Seracco’s account of what she was told is sparse of detail.
	
	
	The Crown contends that this evidence is relevant to put in context other evidence which it will call as part of the Crown’s obligation to put all relevant evidence before the jury. That is evidence that in March 2010 police obtained an apprehended domestic violence order for the protection of the accused from the deceased, after an allegation from the accused that the deceased had put his hands to her throat and attempted to choke her.
	
	
	I am informed by the Crown that the narrative that formed part of the application for the apprehended domestic violence order contains no reference to a bottle having been thrown or glass smashed.
	
	
	The Crown says Ms Seracco’s evidence of what she was told in March 2011 of an incident that had just occurred puts this evidence of the apprehended domestic violence order incident into context in that it shows that both the deceased and the accused dealt with each other violently. The Crown says that because there was only one occasion when police were involved with the deceased and the accused, the incident recounted by Ms Seracco and that recorded by police must be the same, despite the factual differences in the two events, and despite the difference in time of one year.
	
	
	Insofar as it says anything about the accused’s conduct towards the deceased, that is no more than that she had put her hands on the deceased during an argument. Who threw the bottle and in what circumstances is not established, and nor is there any explanation of what it may mean for the accused to have put her hands on the deceased during an argument.
	
	
	Even if one accepts that the incident recounted to Ms Seracco in March 2011 and that which occurred in March 2010 are the same - and I for one, do not draw that conclusion - the former can say little, if anything, about the latter, and it fails to place it into any meaningful context in my view. The detail is wholly absent so as to render what was said to Ms. Seracco devoid of ascertainable meaning.
	
	
	The evidence fails to meet the test of relevance set out at s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 and I reject it.

2703064,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police – s 19 application for restraint of assets [2015] NSWSC 948,"Judgment


	
	This is an application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police for restraining orders pursuant to section 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The application is supported by an affidavit of Darren James Burtenshaw sworn on 13 July 2015. Mr Burtenshaw deposes to the fact that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	Mr Burtenshaw swears that he suspects that the property specified in schedules 1 and 2 of the summons is wholly or partly the proceeds and/or the instrument of an indictable and serious offence within the meaning of section 19(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act. The offence is dealing with money that is reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime and at the time of dealing the value of the money is $A100,000 or more, contrary to section 400.9(1) of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He also suspects that the property is wholly or partly the proceeds and/or instrument of an indictable and serious offence, being the offence of depositing money into bank accounts for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the money involved in the transaction was deposited in a manner and form that would not give rise to a threshold transaction that would have been required to have been reported under section 43 of the Anti-money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), contrary to section 142(1) of that Act.
	
	
	The offences against section 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code and section 142(1) of the AML Act are both indictable offences and serious offences for the purposes of those Acts.
	
	
	Mr Burtenshaw sets out the grounds for his suspicion which is based principally on a statement of facts prepared by the criminal case officer responsible for investigating two named persons. It is not necessary to detail the factual basis for Mr Burtenshaw's suspicion. I am satisfied, from a reading of the statement of facts and the other documents annexed to his affidavit, that his suspicion is held on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	Section 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act requires the making of a restraining order in circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or an instrument of a serious offence and that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	Section 26(4) of the Act requires that the Court must consider the application without notice having been given to any person if the responsible authority, that is the Commissioner of the AFP, requests the Court to do so. The Commissioner has so requested.
	
	
	For those reasons it is appropriate that I make the orders that are set out in the short minutes of order.    I note the usual undertaking as to damages that has been given by the solicitor for the plaintiff.
	
	
	I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7 of the short minutes of order. The proceedings are listed for further directions before the Common Law Registrar on 14 October 2015 at 9am. Liberty is given to restore the matter on three days' notice and I direct that the orders be entered forthwith.

		16 July 2015",2015-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2703092,Gladio Pty Ltd v Buckworth [2015] NSWSC 922,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR:   What should have been a simple claim for return of a deposit of $145,000.00 has given rise to a hearing extending over six days in this Court, occupying the attention of four separately represented parties. Litigation on that scale over such a sum defies common sense. It is very difficult to see how parties, properly advised and aware of their obligations under s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), could have permitted matters to come to such a pass.
	


Nature of the case


	
	The deposit was paid pursuant to a contract for sale of shares, ownership of which carried the right of exclusive occupancy of a “company title” home unit in a building, known as “Ashdown”, at Elizabeth Bay. The first defendant (Ms Buckworth) was the vendor. The plaintiff (Gladio) was the purchaser. The second defendant (Ashdown) is the proprietor of the land, and is the company, the shares in which were the subject of the contract for sale. The cross-defendant (SCTM) was Ashdown’s managing agent.
	
	
	Gladio’s primary case is that it rescinded the contract for sale pursuant to an express right to do so. It brings alternative cases against Ms Buckworth alleging misleading or deceptive, or unconscionable, conduct. Alternatively, it says, the contract for sale was frustrated. Ms Buckworth cross-claims against Gladio (for damages for breach of contract) and against Ashdown (for indemnity, in the event that Gladio succeeded against her).
	
	
	Gladio says, alternatively, that Ashdown owed it, and breached, a duty of care in relation to communications. There was also an alternative case brought against Ashdown, alleging misleading or deceptive conduct.
	
	
	Ashdown joined its managing agent, SCTM, as a cross-defendant. Ashdown says that if it had some liability to Gladio, that liability arises out of acts or omissions of SCTM. In addition, Ashdown raises issues of proportionate liability, involving not only the parties to the litigation but also a legal searcher, EYEON Group Pty Ltd (Eyeon), which caused to be carried out pre-contractual searches of the records of Ashdown maintained by SCTM.
	
	
	Those disputes generated three versions of a statement of a claim, and responsive pleadings (and of course the cross-claim pleadings). The final articulation of Gladio’s case is to be found in the Further Amended Statement of Claim (FASOC) filed on 12 May 2015. That is a prolix and absurdly over-complicated document. It comprised 16 prayers for relief and 142 paragraphs defined into 10 “Chapters”, one of which was subdivided into four “Divisions”.
	
	
	The prolix and overly complex nature of the FASOC, and the corresponding complexity of the defences to it, make it impossible to attempt any more helpful distillation of the real issues in dispute than the brief and inadequate summary that I have given already. Thus, although with reluctance, I propose to deal with the matter by setting out the background (and mostly uncontroversial) facts, and then turning to the case against each of the defendants, and to the cross-claims. To the extent necessary, when I deal with the case against one or other of the defendants, and to the cross-claims. I will make such further findings of fact as are necessary to explain the conclusions to which I have come.
	
	
	Once I have dealt with the issues between the parties, I shall deal with two interlocutory rulings. One is the ruling on the admissibility of documents, to which objection was taken on the basis of “settlement privilege” (Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 131). The other is an application made by Ms Buckworth for leave to withdraw an admission.
	


Background facts


	
	Prior to 24 April 2009, Ms Buckworth and her then partner Ms Daley bought shares in the capital of Ashdown that gave them the exclusive right of occupancy of what was known as “unit 20” (which included a separate car parking space). At some time after April 2009, the relationship between Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley having broken down, Ms Daley transferred her interest in the shares in question to Ms Buckworth.
	
	
	The previous owners of the shares, who were the vendors to Ms Daley and Ms Buckworth, had sought and obtained the consent of Ashdown to the carrying out of certain works. Those works included the construction of a pergola on a terrace located at the western end of unit 20, and the installation of air-conditioning. The ducting and some of the machinery for the air-conditioning were to be installed in the roof space above unit 20 – in what would be “common property” if the building were a strata title development.
	
	
	It seems that the previous owners had made application to Sydney City Council for consent to those works. Of necessity, that application required the consent of Ashdown, which consent had been given. Although Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley wanted to have a pergola and air-conditioning, what they wanted varied from what had been approved. Accordingly, they had to make application for a variation to the existing consent (see s 96 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)). That s 96 application required the consent of Ashdown.
	
	
	On 24 January 2009, Ms Daley wrote to a member of the Board of Ashdown. She enclosed a “completed application request for Renovation”. That application disclosed the nature of the works as:
	


RELOCATION OF EXISTING APPROVED (BUT UNBUILT) TERRACE PERGOLA FROM NORTH TO SOUTH RUNNING, TO JUST LOCATED ON SOUTH SIDE

REINSTATEMENT OF AIR-CONDITIONING DA


	
	The “affected areas”, as to the air-conditioning, were said to include the living room, the dining room, the main bedroom and the second bedroom. The “affected surfaces” were said to include the walls and the ceilings.
	
	
	In response to a question “Do you wish to remove any walls in part or whole? (Please specify)” the reply was given:
	


ONLY TO FACILITATE THE AIR-CONDITIONING VENTS


	
	Both Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley signed the application.
	
	
	Documents attached to the application dealt with the change to the pergola. None of them seems to have referred specifically to the air-conditioning.
	
	
	The application was considered at a meeting of Ashdown’s directors held on 31 March 2009. Item 6 of the minutes is in the following terms:
	


6.   Renovations Unit 20. Detailed drawings were tabled for consideration. The work involved includes the installation of air conditioning and a free standing pergola. As these items had been deleted by the previous Section 96 application it will be necessary for another Section 96 to be lodged with Council.

After discussion it was agreed:-

*   These renovations will not need to be presented to the shareholders as they were on the original Development Application approved by the shareholders,

*   Permission be given for the lodgement of the Section 96 Application,

*   Luca Turnbull will be engaged to inspect the membrane when the pavers are removed and before the timber decking in [sic] installed,

*   Weir & Phillips, architects, to inspect the installation of the air conditioning in the roof space,

*   The shareholders will undertake to address any problems with the air conditioning such as noise but the Board of Directors reserve the right to withdraw the approval for the air conditioning if the problems can be resolved,

*   The pergola will not be attached to the building and will be held down by the timber decking,

*   All of the heavy planter pots will be removed from the roof deck.


	
	On 24 April 2009, Ms Daley and Ms Buckworth wrote to Ashdown in the following terms:
	


Virginia Buckworth and Louise Daley, owners of shares in Ashdown Home Units Pty Limited relating to apartment 20, as part of the application for air-conditioning seek consent to utilise the roof space above our apartment to locate ducting and the compressor unit in accordance with the specifications that have been presented to the Board.

In making this application we acknowledge:

the space we seek to utilise for the above purpose is company property and not subject to any rights of exclusive use; and

in the event the company decides to use, for any purpose, all or part of the roof space within which the ducting and compressor unit is located, then we agree to remove these items as required, at our expense, and agree that we are not entitled to any compensation for the loss of use of this space and removal of those items.

We note that if any problems arise with the installation in the roofspace, we will be given the opportunity to resolve these issues, but that the Board of Directors reserves the right to withdraw approval for the air conditioning installation if problems continue.

We will locate the air conditioning items in the roof space as close as possible to the terrace at the Western end of the area, and should there prove to be noise disturbance to unit 21 from the operation of the air conditioning unit, we will install agreed acoustic separation.

We also note that this arrangement will also apply to any future shareholders of Unit 20, and that House Rules of Ashdown Home Units will be amended to include these conditions of approval.”


	
	There is no evidence of any resolution that in terms accepts, or agrees to, that letter prior to 28 October 2013 (after the contract for sale between Ms Buckworth and Gladio was made and (purportedly) rescinded). On 28 October 2013, the Board resolved as follows:
	


House Rules:   The Board resolved that a new Rule 22 would be made as follows:

22.   AIR CONDITIONER FOR UNIT 20: Unit 20 was permitted to install an air-conditioner and related equipment on company property in the roof space above the apartment. The terms and conditions on which this permission was granted are set out in the letter (and documents accompanying the letter) dated 24 April 2009 attached as Appendix 1 to these Rules (Letter). As indicated in the Letter, the shareholder(s) of Unit 20 from time to time is (are) bound by the terms of the Letter.

Carried, with L. Roylance abstaining.


	
	The abstaining director, Ms Roylance, gave evidence. She was the only person (at least, who gave evidence) who had been a director both in 2009 and 2013. She accepted that there was no record of any resolution, dealing with the letter of 24 April 2009, between the date that letter was written and 28 October 2013. Her attention was not (in this context) directed to the email dated 9 August 2013, to which I refer at [52], [53] below.
	
	
	On 25 or 27 April 2009, Ashdown gave its consent to the s 96 application. It did so by affixing its common seal to the document. That was authorised by two directors, Ms Cannane and Mr Carter (on 25 April), and the company’s secretary, Ms McDonald (on 27 April). (The evidence suggests that the company secretary of Ashdown from time to time was an employee of whoever was its managing agent at the time.)
	
	
	The works were in due course carried out. The installation of the air-conditioning involved, as I have said, the location of some machinery within the roof space of the building. The parties conducted the litigation on the basis that this was outside the boundaries of “unit 20”.
	
	
	It was Ms Buckworth’s case that the ducting for the air-conditioning was located, at least in part, within the roof space. However, such evidence as there was on the point suggests that the ducting is located:
	



	
	in some rooms, within a bulkhead that was constructed below the soffit of the ceiling; and
	
	
	in other locations, in the walls of unit 20.
	



	
	There were no drawings in evidence which would show the details of the air-conditioning installation. However, as a matter of common sense, it must be the case that even for the outlets located in the bulkheads to which I have referred, some ducting is likely to pass from the machinery through a part of the roof space to the ducting located within those bulkheads.
	
	
	On 10 December 2012, Ms Buckworth leased unit 20 to Mr Robbiati. Mr Robbiati is the sole director and shareholder of Gladio. The lease to Mr Robbiati required, and had, the consent of Ashdown (given by its directors). It is apparent that, at least in the opinion of some of the directors and some of the residents of Ashdown, Mr Robbiati was not a satisfactory tenant. Apparently, his partner would from time to time visit him and bring with her a dog. It seems that the dog was given to barking (not an uncommon habit of the canine species, particularly when kept in confined spaces), and that its barking was a source of annoyance to other residents.
	
	
	Ms Buckworth wanted to sell “unit 20”. Mr Robbiati was interested in buying it. Ultimately, on 16 July 2013, they made the contract for sale of shares that is the subject of this litigation.
	
	
	For reasons that are unclear (and in any event are probably irrelevant), Mr Robbiati decided to buy the shares in the name of Gladio. He instructed a firm of solicitors, Day Legal, to act for Gladio. Mr Day of that firm had responsibility for the matter. Ms Buckworth instructed Hunt & Hunt. Mr Lane of that firm had responsibility on her behalf.
	
	
	Before contracts were exchanged, Mr Day caused searches to be made by Eyeon. Eyeon retained an independent searcher, Ms Kritikos, to carry out searches of Ashdown’s records. Ms Kritikos did that, at the offices of SCTM, on 21 June 2013.
	
	
	Gladio’s pleaded case was that the records made available to Eyeon on 21 June 2013 did not include the 24 April 2009 letter or any Board minute or other records relating to the air-conditioning in unit 20. It will be necessary to return to the detail of that evidence. However, for present purposes, it is enough to note that I find that the records made available to Ms Kritikos for inspection did include, in at least two places, copies of the letter of 24 April 2009; and included, further, a copy of the Board resolution of 31 March 2009, with item 6 in the terms set out at [17] above.
	
	
	I do accept (and it was not challenged) that the report that Eyeon made to Day Legal did not include any reference to that letter or that resolution. It follows, and I find, that Mr Robbiati caused Gladio to enter into the contract for sale unaware of the terms of the letter of 24 April 2009. In particular, I find, Mr Robbiati caused Gladio to enter into the contract for sale unaware of the circumstances that (as that letter records):
	



	
	Ashdown could require the air-conditioning equipment to be removed if it wished itself to use the roof space;
	
	
	the approval for the air-conditioning installation could be withdrawn in the case of “problems” – either with the installation generally, or specifically with noise; and
	
	
	the terms of “this arrangement” were to be reflected in the House Rules so as to make them applicable to future shareholders.
	


The contract for sale and subsequent developments


	
	The contract for sale identified the subject matter of the sale as certain identified “Shares” in the capital of Ashdown. It recited that those shares:
	


… entitle the holder to the exclusive use and occupation of the home unit no. 20 and garage space 2 contained in the building situate at… Elizabeth Bay NSW (collectively referred to in the agreement as “Unit”).


	
	By cl 4, a 5% deposit was payable, in the sum to which I have referred, direct to Ms Buckworth:
	


4.   Deposit

Upon the date of the making of this agreement the Purchaser will pay the Vendor a deposit of 5% of the Price being $145,000.00 which will be accounted to the Vendor forthwith and the balance of the Price must be paid to the Vendor’s solicitors in cash on completion or as they may otherwise direct in writing.


	
	Clause 6.1 dealt with consent:
	


6.   Consent to transfer 

6.1   Date by which consent to be obtained 

This agreement is subject to the written consent of Ashdown Home Units Pty Limited ACN 000 176 009 (“the Company”) to the transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser. If consent is not obtained within 38 days from the date of the making of this agreement either party may by notice in writing to the other rescind this agreement and thereupon the deposit will be refunded to the Purchaser and upon return to the deposit neither party will have any claim on the other arising out of this agreement.


	
	It was common ground on the pleadings that the last date for satisfaction of cl 6.1 was 23 August 2013.
	
	
	Clause 9 dealt with Ashdown’s Constitution and “House Rules”:
	


9.   Memorandum and Articles of Association and House Rules 

9.1   Copy attached 

The Shares are held by the Vendor and sold subject to the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company and the House Rules and a copy of each is attached to this agreement (“Articles of Association and House Rules”). The Purchaser has satisfied itself from its review of the Articles of Association and House Rules that on completion of the sale, ownership of the Shares will entitle the owner (subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association and House Rules and the Lease) to the exclusive right of use and occupancy of the Unit.

9.2   Purchaser review 

The Purchaser acknowledges that prior to entering into this agreement it has satisfied itself as to the Articles of Association and House Rules of the Company.

9.3   No warranty 

The Vendor discloses that it made application to the Company before the date of this agreement for a complete copy of the Articles of Association and House Rules, inclusive of any resolutions to vary or amend as may have been resolved by the Company from time to time. The copy of the Articles of Association and House Rules attached to this agreement were supplied by the Company to the Vendor in response to the Vendor’s request and the Vendor makes no warranty they are complete or accurate. The Purchaser must satisfy itself in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the Articles of Association and House Rules prior to entering this agreement and can make no claim, requisition, and objection or purport to rescind or terminate this agreement on the grounds of anything referred to in or arising from this clause.


	
	Clause 10 set out a number of “conditions of sale”, including, relevantly:
	


10.   Conditions of sale acknowledged by vendor 

The Vendor acknowledges and agrees that it is a condition of this agreement:

   …

(g)   that the respective registers of members, directors and charges and all other books of the Company required by law to be kept by it are properly kept;


	
	Clause 12 dealt with requisitions:
	


12.   Requisitions 

All requisitions which the Purchaser is entitled to make will be made and delivered to the Vendor or their solicitor within 21 days of the date of the making of this agreement and all requisitions not so made shall be deemed to be waived. If the Vendor is unable or unwilling to comply with or remove any objective or requisition which the Purchaser has made and not waived within 14 days after the Vendor has given to the Purchaser written notice of intention to rescind this agreement the Vendor will be entitled to rescind this agreement and all money paid or given by the Purchaser will be refunded and the Vendor will not be liable to any sum for damage or expenses whatsoever.


	
	The annexures to the contract for sale included the lease to Mr Robbiati, the Articles of Association of Ashdown, and the “Rules and Regulations” (or, as they were often called, “House Rules”). Relevant provisions of the Articles include articles 41, 118, 121 and 161:
	


41.   The right of members to transfer their shares shall be restricted as follows:-

(a)   Shares shall only be transferable in the groups specified in Articles 4 and 4(a).

(b)   The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of a group of shares upon which the Company has a lien.

(c)   No transfer shall be made to an infant or person of unsound mind but the Directors shall not be bound to enquire as to the age or soundness of mind of any transferee.

(d)   Deleted 25.9.72 New Article Substituting:

Companies Act, 1936,

Section 98.

Ashdown Home Units Pty. Limited 

At the Annual General Meeting of the abovenamed company duly convened and held at the Mansions Hotel, Room 100, Kellett Street, Kings Cross on Monday, 25 September, 1972 the following alteration was made to the Articles of Association for the company.

“By deleting paragraph (d) of Article 41 and substituting the following new paragraph:

Subject to the provisions of Clauses (a) (b) (c) of this Article, the Directors may decline to register any transfer of shares to a transferee of whom they do not approve (and who they have not previously resolved is approved as suitable to be a member of the company) and shall not be bound to assign any grounds or reason for so declining. If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of any shares, they shall forthwith send to the transferee notice of their refusal as required by Section 97 of the Companies Act.”

DATED at Sydney this Twenty-fifth day of September, 1972.

                   P. C. ABRAHAMS

                     SECRETARY

118.   The Directors shall cause minutes to be duly entered in books provided for the purpose:-

(a)   Of the names of the Directors present at each meeting of the Directors and of any Committee of Directors.

(b)   Of all declarations made or notice given by any Director pursuant to the requirements of Section 129 of the Companies Act.

(c)   Of all orders made by the Directors and Committees of Directors.

(d)   Of all resolutions and proceedings of General Meeting and of

meetings of the Directors and Committees.

And any such minutes of any meeting of the Directors or any

Committee of the Company if purporting to be signed by the Chairman of such meeting or by the Chairman of the next succeeding meeting, shall be receivable as prima facie evidence of the matters stated in such minutes. The books containing the minutes of General Meetings shall be kept at the office and shall during business hours be open for the inspection of members.

…

121.   The Directors shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal and the Seal shall not be used except by the Authority of the Directors or a Committee of the Directors, and in the presence of at least two Directors who shall sign every instrument to which the Seal is affixed and every such instrument shall be countersigned by the Secretary or some other person appointed by the Directors.

…

161.   The Directors may from time to time make regulations for the efficient and economic conduct of the building known as “Ashdown” and a copy of such regulations and of any amendments from time to time thereto shall be forwarded to every shareholder or other the occupier for the time being of flats in the said building and such regulations shall have effect as if they had been incorporated in and formed part of these Articles.


	
	As to the annexed House Rules, all that needs to be said is that they did not include any rule relating to the air-conditioning installation that serviced unit 20, nor did they contain any rule of the kind contemplated by the last paragraph of the 24 April 2009 letter.
	
	
	No copy of that letter was annexed to the contract for sale. Nor was a copy of the relevant resolution of 31 March 2009 annexed. There was nothing in the contract that would have alerted Mr Robbiati or Mr Day to the existence of the letter, or to the terms of the resolution preceding it.
	
	
	Day Legal made requisitions on title on 22 July 2013. Requisition 21 was as follows:
	


21.   If the Vendors have a lease or licence agreement with the company:-

(a)   an assignment of such lease or licence agreement, with the consent of the company endorsed and signed by the Vendors, must be handed over on completion, or    

(b)   a new lease or licence agreement between the company and the Purchasers, executed by the company, must be handed over at settlement.

(c)   Please provide us before settlement with the documentation for the Purchasers to sign.


	
	Hunt & Hunt replied on 3 September 2013. The reply to requisition 21 was:
	


21.   The vendor does not have a lease or licence agreement with the company.


	
	It is convenient to note at this point that Mr Lucarelli of Counsel, who appeared for Gladio, submitted that the 24 April 2009 either was, or evidenced the terms of, a licence to use what he called “common property” in connection with the unit 20 air-conditioning. Mr Grieve of Queens Counsel, who appeared for Ms Buckworth, maintained that requisition 21 was not a proper requisition on title, and hence that even if the reply were incorrect (which I do not think he conceded), nothing turned on it.
	
	
	On 24 July 2013, Hunt & Hunt sought Ashdown’s consent to the transfer of shares from Ms Buckworth to Gladio. The letter and its attached documents made it clear that Mr Robbiati was the sole director and shareholder of Gladio. The letter said of him that:
	


… that gentlemen [sic] presently rents the property and he was previously approved by the company to occupy the premises as a tenant.


	
	It is clear that the Board of Ashdown was concerned by the possibility of having Gladio as a shareholder, and Mr Robbiati as an “owner” / resident. Some of that concern at least appeared to relate to the “barking dog” issue. There was also a question, in the minds of some of the directors at least, as to whether Ashdown’s constitution permitted corporate shareholders.
	
	
	By the end of the hearing, it was common ground between Ashdown, Ms Buckworth and Gladio that whether or not SCTM had actual authority to communicate, so as to bind Ashdown, matters such as (for example) approval or non-approval of applications to become a shareholder, it had at least ostensible authority to do so. It was equally clear that, on matters of any importance whatsoever, as between Ashdown and SCTM, the latter was only to communicate on the instructions of, and in the terms authorised by it, Ashdown. On important matters, the precise terms of the reply were communicated by Ashdown to SCTM, so that they could be cut and pasted into an email or letter by SCTM to whoever was to be the recipient of the communication.
	
	
	On 31 July 2013, Mr Greene, an employee of SCTM, sent an email to Mr Lane. It was Ashdown’s practice to communicate through SCTM rather than direct. That email stated, so far as it is relevant:
	


We are the managing agents for Ashdown Home Units.

I have been informed by the directors of Ashdown Home Units that they are not prepared to accept the above transfer in its present form.

Ashdown Home Units Pty Ltd is unable to consider a request to transfer shares to a company, as it is clear in the Articles of Association that only a person can be a shareholder..

Please advise your client to change the entity of the proposed shareholder to a person.

Once this is done, and a fresh application is received, it will be considered in the normal manner with an interview to follow.

Please advise this position to your client and let me know the new arrangement.


	
	Mr Lane responded swiftly, saying that he had to leave the office and would communicate further upon his return and after he had spoken to his client. The next day, Mr Lane replied in the following terms:​
	


…

We have reviewed the constitution of Ashdown Home Units Pty Ltd. We cannot see any reference in the constitution that prohibits a shareholder from being a corporation.

To the contrary, the constitution does indeed clearly provide for non-natural persons to hold shares and we draw your attention to:

the definition section in clause 1 whereby the term “person” also means a “corporation”; and

clauses 82 and 83 which set out the proxy requirements for a shareholder that is a corporation.

Copies of the above clauses are highlighted and attached to this email.

If, as you contend in the 3rd sentence of your email, “it is clear in the Articles of Association that only a person can be a shareholder” then could you please direct us to the relevant provision within the constitution that supports that position. We do not believe that is the case and this is clearly supported by the clauses in the constitution we have brought to your attention in the attached.

We would appreciate the executive reviewing its decision in light of the above and look forward to receiving a formal response to our client’s request for consent to the transfer of her shares.

Please also note that our client is incurring additional legal fees in having to deal with the position as presented in your email yesterday and we reserve her rights.


	
	Not surprisingly, Mr Lane’s reply led to considerable discussion between the directors of Ashdown. Those directors included (I think this is a recognised collective noun) a quarrel of lawyers: highly experienced and well-regarded legal practitioners. One matter which arose out of those discussions was “an additional rule to cover shareholders who are not real persons”. In the course of those discussions, it seems that Mr Bell (a solicitor, and a director at the time) spoke to Mr Robbiati. Their conversation covered the following matters (email from Mr Bell to other directors of 2 August 2013):
	


…

I just spoke to Tarek.

1.   He said he is amenable to give an undertaking to comply with the rules as if her [sic] were a shareholder himself personally.

2.   He is unaware of the air conditioner unit agreement – I told him I would send him a copy of that.

3.   His partner has a dog when she comes from Melbourne. He said he might as well state now that he will be making an application for the dog. I told him we had amended the rules to prevent the board from having any power to permit dogs. I explained to him the problem we’ve had. No [sic] sure we resolved anything, but told him that dogs were a problem.


	
	On 5 August 2013, Mr Lane emailed Mr Greene in the following terms:
	


…

I refer to our telephone conversation this morning and understand that the directors will consent to the share transfer on the proviso that the corporate shareholder director provides some agreement to be personally liable for levies etc.

As mentioned this morning, I am representing a client mid–conveyance and would appreciate if the [illegible – to the effect of “directors could”] clarify their position in writing as soon as possible.


	
	Mr Greene forwarded that email to the Board for instructions. He was instructed to reply in terms to the following effect:
	


… it will require a change to the House Rules to accommodate the request for a corporate entity to buy shares in Ashdown. This at least is easier than a change to the Articles of Association. An out-of-course director’s meeting has been scheduled for Thursday 8 August to discuss a new rule to accommodate the request. Naturally the Board has taken legal advice to ensure the new rule or rules protect both the prospective purchaser and Ashdown…

A copy of the new rules will be sent to your promptly after the meeting. You can then send them to Mr Dale [sic; presumably, “Mr Day”].


	
	On 9 August 2013, Mr Lee on behalf of the Board emailed Mr Greene, giving him instructions on the application by Gladio to become a shareholder. Those instructions were:
	


…

Last night the Board discussed the application by Gladio Pty Ltd to purchase shares and become a member of Ashdown. The Board has agreed to this purchase, as usual subject to interview, and therefore asks you to contact Mr Robbiati and ask him when he might be available for this interview.

The Board has amended two rules (15 has been tightened and 20 has been liberalised, both in the light of recent experience) and created two new ones (22 and 23). The new rules 22 and 23 were created specifically to accommodate Gladio Pty Ltd’s purchase of the shares. They are not especially noteworthy (and certainly not in the least oppressive) and are designed merely to satisfy the Board of continuity of current arrangements under the new ownership structure. Could you please inform Mr Robbiati’s solicitor of these changes and send him a copy of the amended rules.

Could you also please inform Chris Dale [sic] of this news and send him a copy of the amended rules for his information.

…


	
	The attached House Rules read as follows:
	


22.   AIR-CONDITIONER FOR UNIT 20: Subject to the terms of a letter from the owners of that unit to the Board dated 24 April 2009, unit 20 was permitted to install an air-conditioner and related equipment on company property in the roof space above the apartment. In the event of any complaint or dispute (for example over noise), the owners of unit 20 are obliged either to remove or sound-proof the air-conditioner at their expense. The Board has the right to withdraw this permission at any time and the air-conditioner’s removal will be entirely at the expense of the owners of unit 20 if such permission is withdrawn.

23.   SHAREHOLDING BY A COMPANY: In the event that a company becomes a shareholder of Ashdown, whoever is a director of that company at the time of purchase shall be bound to comply with all Articles and Rules of Ashdown as if they were a shareholder. The director must provide full details of the purchasing company to the Board before any shares are registered in the name of the purchasing company. The only persons permitted to occupy the unit thus purchased are those who were directors or the immediate family of directors at the time of purchase. Thus the standard residence requirements of shareholders as outlined in the Articles and Rules apply to the directors of a company purchasing the shares.


	
	Mr Greene did not comply precisely with the terms of the instructions given to him. On 9 August 2013, he emailed Mr Lane in the following terms:
	


…

Please be advised that the board of directors of Ashdown have given approval to the above sale proceeding provided you instruct your client of the amended rules and regulations here attached. (in particular to clause 23)

I hope this has cleared the obstacles to this conveyance matter.

…


	
	Significantly, Mr Greene did not note that the “approval” was “as usual subject to interview”.
	
	
	Ms Buckworth relies on SCTM’s email of 9 August 2013 as being a sufficient consent for the purposes of cl 6.1 of the contract for sale. Gladio says otherwise. It was not in dispute – at least, by the time of submissions – that if the email is to be characterised as a consent, it was, in all the circumstances, a consent binding on Ashdown notwithstanding that it went beyond, or did not reflect, the terms of the instructions given by Ashdown to SCTM.
	
	
	On 12 August 2013 (9 August was a Friday and 12 August was the following Monday), Mr Lane forwarded SCTM’s email of 9 August 2013 to Mr Day, noting “that your client has been approved as transferee of the shares”.
	
	
	Also on 12 August 2013, an employee of Day Legal sent two documents to Mr Greene to be executed by or on behalf of Ashdown. Mr Greene sent those documents on to Ashdown. He did so by forwarding an email chain which included Mr Lane’s email to Mr Day noting that Gladio had been approved as transferee of the shares. To jump ahead for a moment: some days later, on 22 August 2013, Mr Greene forwarded to the Board another email from Mr Lane, which included the comment that:
	


My client appreciates that the Board approved the transfer of her shares to Gladio…


	
	Perhaps not surprisingly, Mr Day was concerned by the amendments to the House Rules by the inclusion of rules 22 and 23. He emailed Mr Lane on 16 August 2013 commenting among other things that:
	


It is disturbing, to say the least, that it appears that a number of the amendments to the Rules and Regulations which were not disclosed in the Agreement for Sale of Shares have been made specifically by the Board of Directors in response to the Purchasers [sic] request for consent to register the Transfer of Shares.

…

In the meantime, I reiterate that we reserve all of the Purchaser’s rights, including the right to rescind…


	
	On 26 August 2013, Mr Day sent a further email to Mr Lane in which he “formally reiterate[d] the reservation of the Purchaser’s rights…”
	
	
	Mr Lane’s position, as expressed in his email in reply, was simple:
	


Your client was approved as transferee of the shares on 9 August 2013 as confirmed by email from the company’s managing agent… which was forwarded to you on 12 August 2013.

The condition precedent in clause 6 of the contract was satisfied within the time provided by that clause.


	
	There was further discussion and correspondence, both among the directors of Ashdown and between Day Legal and Hunt & Hunt. Ultimately, Gladio took the view that cl 6.1 had not been satisfied. It instructed Day Legal to give notice of rescission on its behalf. This Day Legal did on 26 September 2013. The notice recited the grounds to rescind as follows:
	


…

The Purchaser’s grounds to rescind the Agreement include:

1.   That the Company did not consent to the transfer of the Shares from the vendor to the Purchaser within the time and upon the terms specified in the Agreement,

2.   In the alternative, that the Company did not unconditionally consent to the transfer of the Shares from the Vendor to the Purchaser within the time and upon the terms specified in the Agreement,

3.   In the alternative, that the Rules attached to the Agreement were not the Rules of the Company as at 16 July, 2013,

4.   In the alternative, that the Vendor did not disclose in the Agreement that the Airconditioning System is located wholly outside the Apartment and no right to retain the Airconditioning System attaches to the Shares or the exclusive use and occupation of the Apartment,

5.   In the alternative, that the Vendor did not disclose the terms of the AC Agreement to the Purchaser in the Agreement or prior to 16 July 2013,

6.   In the alternative, that the Agreement does not comply with the provisions of the Home Building Act 1989 and the Regulations made under that Act, and

7.   In the alternative, that the Vendor has engaged in deceptive and misleading conduct in the terms of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and other NSW and Australian legislation.


	
	The expression “the AC agreement” was a reference to what was (in Gladio’s view):
	


…

A written agreement between, inter alia, the Vendor [Ms Buckworth] and the Company [Ashdown] dated 24 April 2009… that the company could enforce the removal of the Airconditioning System at any time.


	
	In turn, the “Airconditioning System” was said to be:
	


The airconditioning system, plant, condenser unit, fan unit and ducting which are a fixture to the Apartment… [which] is located wholly outside the Apartment and no right to retain the Airconditioning System attaches to the Shares for the exclusive use and occupation of the Apartment.


	
	In passing, it might be wondered how something could be both “a fixture to the Apartment” and “located wholly outside the Apartment”; or how something which was “a fixture” could not be the subject of a right of exclusive use and occupation of that to which it was affixed.
	
	
	The asserted claim under the Home Building Act 1989 (NSW) was not a matter that occupied any attention in the pleadings, nor time at the trial.
	
	
	The notice of rescission made no reference to the breach of cl 10(g) which was pleaded and which was in issue at the trial. That breach, according to Mr Lucarelli, is to be found in the failure of Ashdown to minute and retain what he said must have been the decision, or resolution, of the Board to accept the terms of the 24 April 2009 letter.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli submitted that his client was entitled to rely on that breach of condition even though it had not been relied upon in the notice of rescission. He relied on the principles stated in Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd (1931) 45 CLR 359.
	
	
	Mr Grieve did not accept that cl 10(g) stated a “condition” properly so called, breach of which could found a right of termination. He did not appear to dispute that, if the contrary view were to be taken, Gladio was entitled to rely upon it notwithstanding the failure to specify it in the notice of rescission. Since the parties proceeded on the basis that it was open to Gladio to rely on the Shepherd principle, it is not necessary to consider the extent to which that principle applies outside the situation of discharge by breach (see Dixon J in Shepherd at 377-378; and note the discussion in Melbourne Stadiums Ltd v Sautner (2015) 317 ALR 665 at [97] and following).
	


Validity of the notice of rescission


	
	The principal bases on which Mr Lucarelli sought to uphold the rescission were that:
	



	
	Ashdown had not given a consent, of the kind for which cl 6.1 calls, by 23 August 2013;
	
	
	in any event, Gladio was entitled to “rescind” for breach of the condition stated in cl 10(g); and
	
	
	alternatively, Gladio was entitled to rescind for innocent misrepresentation.
	



	
	However, the notice of rescission (see at [62] above) set out a greater number of grounds (which did not include breach of the condition set out in cl 10(g)). I propose first to deal with those that were addressed at trial, in the order that they appear in the notice (grouping some together for convenience), and then to deal with the further pleaded grounds on which Gladio relied.
	


No sufficient consent? 


	
	Clause 6.1 provided that the agreement was subject to Ashdown’s written consent to the transfer of the subject shares to Gladio. It is not necessary to consider whether it was the agreement itself which was intended to be conditional, or the performance of the agreement up to and including completion. If consent were not obtained by the specified time (agreed to be 23 August 2013), either party had the right to rescind.
	
	
	In my view, in calling for “written consent… to the transfer of the Shares” to Gladio, cl 6.1 required that there be an unambiguous and unqualified statement of consent. For example, a statement of consent “subject to interview” (which may be what the Board of Ashdown had instructed Mr Greene to convey) would not have satisfied cl 6.1.
	
	
	The question is whether the email of 9 August 2013 communicated an unconditional approval to the contract. Mr Grieve submitted that it did. Mr Lucarelli submitted that it did not, both in terms and, in particular, when read against the background of the preceding email correspondence between Mr Lane and (through SCTM) Ashdown.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli submitted that everyone knew that Ashdown would not give consent to the transfer of shares until there had been an interview. The interview process had been intercepted, because of the debate as to whether Ashdown’s constitution provided for corporate shareholders.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli then submitted that, viewed against the background of the correspondence relating to that debate, the “approval” that was stated to have been given could only have been an approval of the concept of a sale to a corporate entity (i.e., a reversal of the directors’ initial view on that point). That was confirmed, Mr Lucarelli submitted, by the expression of a hope that “this has cleared the obstacles to this conveyance matter”.
	
	
	The proper characterisation of the 9 August 2013 email must depend to some extent on the context in which it is to be placed. However, in my view, that context should be confined to matters of which both contracting parties – that is to say, Gladio as well as Ms Buckworth – had knowledge. As I have said, Mr Lane took the view that the 9 August 2013 email did communicate approval, and sent an email to Mr Day on 12 August 2013 informing him among other things that by the email (which Mr Lane forwarded), “your client has been approved as transferee of the shares”.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that Mr Day was aware of the detail of, let alone provided with copies of, all the correspondence between Mr Lane and Ashdown (through SCTM) that preceded SCTM’s sending of its 9 August 2013 email.
	
	
	When Mr Lane sought Ashdown’s consent to the transfer of shares to Gladio, he noted that the proposed transferee was a company of which Mr Robbiati was the sole director and shareholder; and that Mr Robbiati had previously been approved as a tenant in the building. That should be taken to suggest that Mr Lane was aware that, as Gladio was a corporate entity, the question of approval would need to be assessed by reference to the person who stood behind it and who would receive the benefit of residence conferred by the shares if they were transferred to Gladio.
	
	
	In my view, the most significant matter of mutually known background which is referable to the proper construction of the 9 August 2013 email is article 41(d). I have set that out at [38] above. It grants the directors power to “decline to register any transfer of shares to a transferee of whom they do not approve (and who they have not previously resolved is approved and suitable to be a member of the company)”. By the terms of that paragraph, the essential question is approval of someone as a transferee of shares. Plainly enough, where the proposed transferee is a corporate entity, the question of approval would require consideration of the natural persons who stand behind the corporation, and who would benefit from the corporation’s exercise of the rights attached to the shares if the transfer were registered.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli submitted, in another part of his case, that Ashdown’s directors must have realised that contracts for the sale of shares in its capital would contain a provision, such as cl 6.1 of the contract for sale, making completion dependent on consent. I think that is correct. It is not necessary to find (and I do not find) that Ashdown’s directors knew of the precise terms of the contract for sale from Ms Buckworth to Gladio. It is enough to find, as I do, that they must have realised, had they turned their minds to the question, that the contract would be subject to their giving approval to the transferee.
	
	
	Although those submissions were made in respect to another part of the case, they are in my view equally relevant to the present issue. That is because they focus attention on precisely what meaning is to be attributed to the giving of “approval to the above sale proceeding” as stated in the 9 August 2013 email. What would a reader of that email, armed with the mutually known background knowledge to which I have referred, make of that expression? In my view, that reader, knowing what cl 41(d) said as to the necessity of approval, would have understood that the approval that was given was an approval in terms of cl 41(d).
	
	
	True it is that there were other matters in dispute which, if resolved one way, could prevent the sale from proceeding. But they were, for one reason or another, reasons why the Board might decide to decline to approve the transfer. Put perhaps less delphically, they were reasons why the Board, pursuant to the discretion conferred by article 41(d), might decline to approve of Gladio as a transferee.
	
	
	Thus, in my view, the plain meaning of the 9 August 2013 email is that the directors, in exercise of a power vested in them to do so, have given approval to the sale proceeding – by inference, to completion. Although article 41 included three other reasons why the right to transfer shares was restricted, any person having knowledge of the mutually known background facts must have understood that the only power to approve was that contained in para (d). Thus, logically enough, such a person would have read the email as constituting an exercise (by granting approval) of the power to approve.
	
	
	In my view, read in context, the email does signify objectively that the Board of Ashdown has resolved to approve Gladio as a transferee of shares in the capital of Ashdown. Further, in my view, that reading of the email would stand even if it were permissible to take into account those other matters of background, known only to Ms Buckworth, to which Mr Lucarelli referred in his submissions on this point.
	
	
	As I have noted, Mr Lucarelli submitted also that any approval given was given on a proviso, which rendered it relevantly qualified, and thus not an unconditional approval of the kind for which cl 6.1 of the contract for sale called. I accept that submission.
	
	
	What follows the statement of approval is a proviso:
	


… provided you instruct your client of the amended rules and regulations here attached. (In particular to clause 23).


	
	That of itself cannot be regarded as a condition of approval. It is no more and no less than a requirement that Mr Lane (the addressee of the email) advise his client of those amended rules. In passing, one might think that it was more important for Mr Day to advise his client of those matters. However, I do not see anything of particular significance turning on this.
	
	
	The proviso could not be regarded sensibly as a condition of approval, which if not satisfied would undo the approval or render it ineffectual. The Board would have no way of knowing whether “you” had ever “instructed” “your client” of the matters referred to. There is no basis for regarding something of which, by its nature, the Board could never be satisfied, as capable of amounting to a qualification on, or a condition possibly capable of undoing if not satisfied, the approval that had just been stated to be given.
	
	
	However, that analysis is insufficient to dispose of the point. The real question is not whether the “proviso” itself should be regarded as some sort of condition. It is, rather, whether read as a whole the “proviso” indicated, objectively and with reasonable clarity, that there were further obstacles to be cleared before the Board would register the transfer to Gladio. In my view, read in that way, the email did indicate that there were further obstacles.
	
	
	The starting point is that the email expressly related the “approval” that had been “given” to the “amended rules and regulations here attached”. It drew attention “in particular to clause 23”. In my view, considered objectively, the clear implication from the email as a whole (including the attachment) is that the approval incorporated, or was subject to the terms of, the new House Rule 23 (and, for that matter, the new House Rule 22).
	
	
	House Rule 23 purported to state “the standard residence requirements of shareholders as outlined in the Article and Rules apply to the directors of a company purchasing shares”. However, in my view, the rule imposed conditions on corporate purchasers that were more onerous than those imposed on natural person purchasers.
	
	
	Clause 4 of the Articles specified the rights given to shareholders: “the exclusive right subject to these Articles to use and occupy the flat” to which the shares were tied. It seems to me to be reasonably arguable that a natural person who held shares in Ashdown could “use” the relevant flat by (for example) permitting members of his or her family to reside there, and perhaps (again for example) by permitting others beyond the family to reside there, if they did so as part of a household including the shareholder. That use might also extend to permitting guests to reside in the flat.
	
	
	However, where the shareholder is a corporation, “[t]he only persons permitted to occupy the unit… are those who were directors or the immediate family of directors at the time of purchase”. And the concept of “use” finds no mention in Rule 23.
	
	
	Further, it seems to be reasonably clear that, for natural person shareholders, “use” may extend to letting in certain circumstances. That is covered by House Rule 20, which reads as follows:
	


20.   TENANTS:    Shares are intended for purchase by owner occupiers only and letting is not permitted. However, in certain extraordinary circumstances, after a period of not less than twelve months residence, shareholders may apply for, and if thought fit, receive approval to let to a tenant for a minimum of twelve months and a maximum of twenty four months. All proposed tenants must be interviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, after signing an agreement to abide by the Rules and Regulations of the Company. The shareholder will be required to lodge a refundable bond equivalent to one year’s maintenance levy with the company against any damage to the building by the tenant.


	
	Where the shareholder is a corporation, there is only a right of occupation given to directors or their immediate family at the time of purchase. The word “use” does not appear. It seems to me to be at least arguable that, in the case of corporate shareholders, letting is not permissible even “in certain extraordinary circumstances” as contemplated by House Rule 20.
	
	
	It is not necessary to consider whether the House Rules impermissibly restrict the rights granted by the articles: either generally, or specifically in the case of corporate shareholders. It is enough to note that, so far as the directors of Ashdown were concerned, their “approval to the… sale proceeding” was clearly intended to be given on the basis that House Rules 22 and, in particular, 23 applied to Gladio. Thus, in my view, properly read, the 9 August 2013 email is to be regarded as making the approval relevantly conditional.
	
	
	Further, House Rule 22 imposed conditions on the enjoyment of the air-conditioning in unit 20. As I have said, the clear implication is that the approval given by the email of 9 August 2013 required Gladio to accept, and abide by, those conditions. It matters not that Ms Buckworth was similarly bound. The simple fact is that Gladio, and purchasers from it, would be equally bound.
	
	
	Of course, it was open to the Board of Ashdown to make House Rules at any time. Provided they exercised their power to do so in good faith and for the benefit of the company as a whole, it is unlikely that any shareholder could challenge the exercise. Thus, if an unqualified approval had been given and Gladio become registered as a shareholder, it might have been open to the Board to make rules such as House Rules 22 and 23. But that is not the point. The point is that they did so between contract and settlement, and in substance required Gladio to acknowledge that the rights that it would acquire on registration were to be limited in the terms suggested by those rules.
	
	
	Thus, in my view, the approval that was given was relevantly, and in an onerous way, conditional. It was not an approval sufficient to satisfy the requirements of cl 6.1 of the contract for sale.
	


Non-disclosure of the rules as at 16 July 2013


	
	The House Rules attached to the contract for sale did not include rules 22 and 23. However, on the evidence, those rules were not made until about 8 August 2013. That is apparent from Mr Lee’s email of 9 August 2013 to Mr Greene, giving him instructions in relation to the question of approval. That email (see at [52] above) suggests that the rules were agreed at the Board meeting held “last night” – i.e., 8 August 2013.
	
	
	It follows that this asserted ground for rescission is not made out.
	


Rescission for misrepresentation 


	
	The right was characterised as a right to rescind in equity for innocent misrepresentation.
	
	
	The misrepresentation case proceeded on the basis that at all material times, Ms Buckworth had in her possession a copy of the letter of 24 April 2009. That was pleaded at FASOC [76]. It was not traversed. Although Ms Buckworth sought leave to withdraw the admission thereby taken to have been made, I refused to grant such leave. My reasons for doing so appear at [372] to [399] below.
	
	
	Thus, among other things, Ms Buckworth’s evidence (taken only on her application for leave to withdraw the admission), that she did not have a copy of the letter in her possession at the relevant time, is not evidence for the purposes of the hearing before me. However, I add that even if it had been admitted for all purposes, I regard it as inherently unpersuasive, having regard to her cross-examination on the point. I shall return to this.
	
	
	The submissions on this issue (and also on the related issue of misleading or deceptive conduct) at times appeared to be based on an unstated premise, that the subject matter of the sale was real estate. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that the subject matter was shares in Ashdown. Thus, what is important is the question of the rights attached to those shares. Subject to any limitation in the contract for sale, Gladio as purchaser would expect to have the unfettered and undiminished enjoyment of whatever those rights may be, under and subject to Ashdown’s constitution.
	
	
	As I have pointed out at [93], article 4 makes it apparent that those rights are “the exclusive right subject to these articles to use and occupy the” relevant flat. There are additional rights given in respect of garage spaces (article 4 (a)) and further rights in respect of roof space (article 4(c), which in fact are part of the “unit 20” rights), but nothing turns on these additional rights.
	
	
	The expression “the flat” is not defined. Clearly enough, the Articles proceed on the mutually understood basis that there were some 31 flats in the building, each separately numbered, and that rights of use and occupation that were given related to a particular numbered flat, the identity and location of which could be established by inspection.
	
	
	It seems to me that the expression “the flat” must include not just the physical space (analogous to a strata lot; but the analogy is imperfect in the extreme) but also the benefits or, more broadly, advantages (and disadvantages) pertaining to it.
	
	
	For example, each flat presumably has the benefit of electricity, water and (perhaps) gas. Of necessity, those benefits would be provided by services that come from outside the physical boundaries of the flat into the flat, terminating in light switches, power points, taps and the like. It would be fanciful to suggest that the rights conveyed by ownership of the shares did not include the rights to use water, electricity and (if available) gas.
	
	
	At this point, and in reference to one of Mr Grieve’s submissions, it would be obvious that the wiring which conveyed electric power to light switches and power points, and the piping which conveyed water to taps, must in part come from locations outside the physical boundaries of the flat. The wiring presumably passes through walls or ceilings; likewise, perhaps, water pipes. But it could not be said, simply because the source of those amenities lay outside the physical boundaries of the flat, that the right to use them was self-evidently by way of licence only, at the entire discretion of the Board.
	
	
	It may be accepted that air-conditioning falls into a somewhat different category to basic utilities such as electricity and water. Nonetheless, it was an obvious and attractive feature of unit 20:
	



	
	that it enjoyed the benefit of air-conditioning;
	
	
	which had been installed in what clearly appeared to be a permanent fashion.
	



	
	By way of illustration of the second point, this is not simply a case where an air-conditioning unit was bolted to the external wall, and fed air into the apartment by means of piping drilled through the wall. The installation was sophisticated, involving as I have said ducting through a bulkhead, vents at the end of the bulkhead, and vents in other walls. One would not ordinarily expect that the benefit of that sophisticated built-in system could be lost at the discretion of the Board.
	
	
	Mr Grieve submitted that the very fact that the air-conditioning installation was apparent to people in Mr Robbiati’s position, and should have been known to include ducting and other apparatus outside the boundaries of the flat itself, should be taken to convey that the benefit of the air-conditioning was available only at the discretion of the Board. I do not agree. On the contrary, in my view, someone who saw and appreciated the sophisticated nature of the installation would assume that it was a permanent feature of unit 20.
	
	
	I turn to the pleaded implied representations. To my mind, each of them overstates the position. I shall start by setting out FASOC [83] to [86]:
	


[83]   By not disclosing the 24 April 2009 Letter to Gladio Ms Buckworth has impliedly represented to Gladio that all the necessary air-conditioning equipment servicing Unit 20 was entirely within Unit 20 or, that to the extent any such equipment was located on common property then the owner of the Shares had exclusive rights to use such common property for that purpose.

[84]   In the alternative, by not disclosing the 24 April 2009 Letter to Gladio Ms Buckworth has caused Gladio to assume that there was no fact, matter or circumstance that would or could enable the Board of Ashdown to require the owner of the Shares at its expense to dismantle and remove the necessary air-conditioning equipment servicing Unit 20.

[85]   In the alternative, by not disclosing the 24 April 2009 Letter to Gladio Ms Buckworth has caused Gladio to assume that all the necessary air-conditioning equipment serving Unit 20 was entirely within Unit 20, that to the extent any such equipment was located on common property then the owner of the Shares had exclusive rights to use such common property for that purpose.

[86]   At all material times prior to and as at 16 July 2013 Ms Buckworth knew or ought to have known that, according to the express terms of the 24 April 2009 Letter, the House Rules were to be amended so as to apply the terms of the 24 April 2009 Letter to successors in title from Ms Buckworth.


	
	As to FASOC [83]: there could be no implied representation “that all the necessary air-conditioning equipment… was entirely within Unit 20”. On the contrary (and to this extent, I accept Mr Grieve’s submission), it must have been plainly apparent to Mr Robbiati that some at least of the equipment was located outside the physical boundaries of unit 20. I should note that the concept of the physical boundaries of unit 20 was not addressed in any detail in the course of submissions. Indeed, the submissions at one stage appeared to conflate that concept with the concept of a strata title lot: in other words, that “unit 20” was, relevantly, the cubic space defined by the inner surfaces of the ceilings, walls and floors. It is not necessary to pursue that question. Whatever “unit 20” might comprise, it would not ordinarily be thought to comprise the roof space above the flat (and no one submitted that it did).
	
	
	Further (and still dealing with FASOC [83]), I do not think that there was an implied representation of “exclusive rights to use… common property”. I do not focus on the infelicity of the expression “common property” in this context. The point is, rather, that the representation overstates what in my view a hypothetical reasonable purchaser would be entitled to assume.
	
	
	That purchaser would know that the subject matter of the sale was not real property (strata title or otherwise) but a parcel of shares. It would thus know that the substance of what was intended to be sold and bought was the rights attaching to those shares. The primary source of such rights is to be found in the Articles. In my view, the purchaser would be entitled to assume (for the reasons I have given) that the rights included the benefit of services such as utilities and, in this particular case, air-conditioning. However, the benefit of air-conditioning does not necessarily depend on some concept such as “exclusive rights to use… common property”. At most, the representation would be that all necessary permissions for the installation of equipment outside the boundaries of unit 20 had been given, and were not unreasonably revocable.
	
	
	I turn to FASOC [84]. That does not in terms plead a representation. It pleads an assumption that Ms Buckworth is said to have caused Gladio to make. Even if this is to be understood as pleading a representation, again it overstates the case. I do not think that it would be reasonable for any intending purchaser to assume that there could be no circumstance that would justify Ashdown or its Board in requiring the removal of the air-conditioning equipment. I accept that a purchaser would have thought that removal could not have been required arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably. But that is not the pleaded case.
	
	
	I turn to FASOC [85]. Again, in terms, that does not plead a representation but, rather, an assumption that Ms Buckworth is said to have caused Gladio to make. Treating it as a pleading of representation, it seems to me to suffer from the defects in FASOC [83] (which, accepting that [85] pleads an assumption rather than a representation, [85] otherwise mirrors).
	
	
	Since the pleaded misrepresentation case assumes in effect that Gladio made the assumptions that are set out in FASOC [84], [85], it follows from what I have said that I do not regard those as assumptions that it was reasonable for Gladio to make in all the circumstances. And to the extent that the case is based on the representation pleaded at FASOC [83], I do not think that the representation is made out.
	
	
	Accordingly, in my view, the pleaded case, that the rescission was justified on the basis on the alleged innocent misrepresentation, must fail.
	


Rescission based on incorrect answer to requisition 


	
	This is pleaded at FASOC [92A], which I set out (omitting its particulars):
	


92A.   Further, or in the alternative, upon receiving Ms Buckworth’s answers to Gladio’s requisitions on title Gladio was entitled to rescind the Share Sale Agreement for misrepresentation or alternatively treat that answer as a repudiation of the Share Sale Agreement, accept such repudiation and terminate the Share Sale Agreement.


	
	The requisition and reply are set out at [41] and [42] above.
	
	
	One important matter, which was not addressed in submissions, is whether, assuming (as I conclude) that the answer is incorrect (or, as Mr Lucarelli characterised it, “false”), Gladio would have been entitled to rescind.
	
	
	As I have noted, Mr Grieve submitted that requisition 21 was not a requisition on title. That was so, he submitted, because it did not go to the title of that which was sold. It was, at most, a requisition as to quality.
	
	
	Mr Grieve relied on well-known cases such as Fletcher v Manton (1940) 64 CLR 37 and Carpenter v McGrath (1996) 40 NSWLR 39. He placed particular reliance on the judgment of Young J in Eighth SRJ Pty Ltd v Merity (1997) 7 BPR 15,189. Those cases concerned contracts for the sale of land.
	
	
	In Fletcher, the alleged defect was a demolition order made, by a government authority having power to do so, after the contract was made but before completion. In Carpenter, the alleged defect was the absence of building approval for improvements erected on land the subject of a contract for sale. In Eighth SRJ, the alleged defect was termite infestation (the significance of which was to be assessed against representations made by the vendor’s agent to the effect that minimum maintenance was required, and that the purchaser would not have to do any work). It was held in each case that the defect was one as to quality, not as to title.
	
	
	Young J summarised the distinction between defects in title and defects in quality in Eighth SRJ at 15,193 as follows:
	


A very fine, but real, distinction exists between defects in title which entitle a person to rescind and defects in quality which do not.

What is a defect in title is difficult to define, but usually encompasses the situation where the vendor is unable to convey the full estate which it promised to convey to the purchaser. A defect in quality merely means that the purchaser obtains the appropriate title to the land but that there are some facts relating to the quality of the property sold which affects [sic] its value.


	
	With the greatest of respect both to the learned judges who decided those cases and to Mr Grieve, I am not sure that the decisions are of any real assistance where the subject matter of the sale is not real estate but, rather, shares in a “company title” scheme. The subject matter of the sale in this case is not just the shares – pieces of paper or their digital equivalents – but the rights that attach to them under the Articles of Association, as amplified (or perhaps confined) by the House Rules. The question is therefore whether the particular thing that is said to be a defect in title goes in some way to those rights, so as to proscribe or limit the purchaser’s enjoyment of them.
	
	
	That is no doubt an interesting question. Mr Grieve’s submissions did not really engage with it, because he rested his case on the basis of the real estate authorities to which I have referred. Mr Lucarelli’s submissions did not engage with it at all.
	
	
	Mr Grieve’s submission appeared to proceed as if the subject matter of the sale were real estate. It was not. The subject matter of the sale was shares in a special purpose company. The shares assured the right of use and occupation of a designated flat. The question is, thus, what were the nature of (and limits upon) those rights? So framed, in my view, a requisition inquiring as to a lease or licence agreement which could affect or limit those rights was, in context, a requisition on title.
	
	
	Even if I were wrong, and the requisition is not to be taken as one on title, the simple fact is, as I have noted, that Ms Buckworth answered it, and did so wrongly. She had in her possession at all relevant times a copy of the 24 April 2009 letter. She knew that it was an important legal document which would be highly material to any prospective purchaser, and that it was intended to bind any prospective purchaser (T114.1-.13):
	


Q.     You understood full well, when you signed this letter, that the terms of this letter were intended to bind any purchaser of your shares, correct?

A.     Correct.

Q.     Now let's just pause there.  You understood, didn't you, when you signed this letter that the terms of this letter were supposed to bind any purchaser of your shares, correct?

A.     Correct.

Q.     And that therefore you must have known when you signed this letter that this letter would be highly material to such any [sic] prospective purchaser of your shares, correct?

A.     Correct.


	
	Further, Ms Buckworth agreed that to her knowledge the letter, intended as it was to bind any purchaser of her shares, formed part of her rights and obligations as a shareholder (T116.42-117.14):
	


Q.   Have I understood your evidence, Ms Buckworth, you've agreed with me have you not that you knew that this letter of 24 April 2009 was an important legal document, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    You knew it was intended to bind any purchaser of your shares, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And you knew that the terms of this letter formed part of your rights and obligations as a shareholder of Ashdown, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    You knew that this letter was supposed to bind any purchaser of your shares, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    You knew that the terms of this letter set out the basis upon which Ashdown consented to your section 96 application, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    You knew that this letter contained two independent bases upon which Ashdown could withdraw its consent, correct?

A.    Yes.


	
	Ms Buckworth agreed that when the contract for sale was prepared, her solicitor asked for all documents relevant to the shares and to unit 20 (T133.45-.48). She gave the solicitor some documents, including those relating to the s 96 application. She did not give the solicitor a copy of the 24 April 2009 letter.
	
	
	Ms Buckworth was asked about the requisitions on title. She said she knew that they (and answers to them) were “part of the normal processes of conveyancing”, and that “the answers to these requisitions had to be correct” (T138.20-.26). She knew, further, that it would be serious if an answer were wrong or incorrect (T138.47-.49).
	
	
	Ms Buckworth agreed, further, that she received a copy of the requisitions from her solicitor at about the time they were made, and that she “needed to give [her] solicitor accurate and complete instructions in order to respond” (T139.1-.7).
	
	
	Ms Buckworth did not accept the proposition that the letter of 24 April 2009 was “in fact a licence agreement with the company”, although she accepted that it was “an important agreement concerning [her] licence to use the roof space” (T140.3-.9).
	
	
	In my view, the letter of 24 April 2009 was, or evidenced, a “licence agreement” between Ashdown and Ms Buckworth, for the purposes of requisition 21. Whether the letter is to be taken as an acceptance of the terms of the Board’s resolution of 31 March 2009, or whether it is to be taken as an offer that was accepted by implication or conduct, it sets out the terms on which Ashdown was prepared to permit Ms Buckworth (and, at the relevant time, Ms Daley) to use roof space that, on any view, was outside “unit 20”. That roof space, forming part of the realty, was vested in Ashdown. Ashdown had the right to use that, subject to the Articles, for the benefit of members as a whole. Any decision to permit one member to use part of that property, if it did not grant rights of exclusive use and occupation so as in law to amount to a lease, must be a “licence” as that term is understood both by ordinary English speakers and by lawyers.
	
	
	Thus, in my view, the answer given to the requisition was wrong. I accept that it was given innocently, in the sense that Ms Buckworth did not, before giving instructions for the answer, consciously turn to the subject matter and decide to withhold relevant information from her solicitor. Mr Lucarelli did not contend that it constituted anything other than an innocent misrepresentation.
	
	
	However, it was not a misrepresentation that preceded the making of the contract for sale. Thus it cannot be said to have induced Gladio to enter into the contract for sale.
	
	
	The question of rescission for innocent misrepresentation based on the requisition was not argued in any detail. It was addressed in Mr Lucarelli’s opening written submissions, but not in his outline submissions handed up on the conclusion of the evidence. Mr Grieve addressed the point on the basis that there was no requisition on title and, hence, that there was no right to rescind.
	
	
	In circumstances where the matter was not fully argued, and where its resolution is not necessary (as between Gladio and Ms Buckworth) I shall leave the point undecided. The relevant facts have been found (and are not to any extent controversial in any event). I have summarised each party’s submissions; and in any event, a more complete account of them is available from the written submissions and the transcript.
	


Misleading or deceptive conduct


	
	The factual material relied upon to support Gladio’s claim that Ms Buckworth had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct related, in substance, to her failure to disclose the 24 April 2009 letter before making the contract for sale. In that respect, it covered the same ground as the (pre-contractual) evidence relied upon in support of the claim for rescission for innocent misrepresentation.
	
	
	Although the source of the prohibition against misleading or deceptive conduct was not expressly mentioned in the FASOC, it was clear that Gladio relied on s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act  2010 (Cth), which has effect as a law of New South Wales by s 28 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW)).
	
	
	The immediate problem with reliance on s 18 is that it proscribes misleading or deceptive conduct “in trade or commerce”. Mr Lucarelli pointed to two matters as engaging that requirement:
	



	
	that, because the sale was subject to Mr Robbiati’s tenancy, it was a sale of an income-producing asset; and
	
	
	that the purchaser, Gladio, was a corporation.
	



	
	There have been numerous cases that consider the reach of the expression “in trade or commerce”. An early but important (for present purposes) decision is that of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in O’Brien v Smolonogov (1983) 53 ALR 107. That case related to the sale of land. The appellants offered a number of parcels of land for sale. The respondents were interested in buying one of those parcels. The respondents asserted that, in a telephone conversation, one of the appellants made misleading or deceptive statements about the land. The primary judge held that the sale was conducted in trade or commerce. The Full Court disagreed. Their Honours, after considering a number of cases including many from the United State of America, concluded that the sale had not taken place in trade or commerce. They said at 113–114:
	


In the present case, it cannot be suggested that the lands acquired by the appellants became trading stock (see FC of T v St Hubert’s Island Pty Ltd (in liq) (1978) 19 ALR 1; 138 CLR 211). Nor is it a case where the taxpayer’s activities amounted to more than the mere realization of a capital asset and constituted the carrying on of land development (see capital asset and constituted the carrying on of land development (see FC of T v Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd (1982) 39 ALR 521). The land itself was not used for any business activity: it was not used for farming or grazing.

It follows, in our opinion, that the only possible feature of the case which could conceivably be relied upon to suggest that the impugned conduct occurred in trade or commerce was the resort by the appellants to a newspaper as a medium of public advertisement of the land and the use made by the parties of the telephone for the purpose of conducting negotiations. It is true, as the learned judge observed, that the use of such facilities is common practice in the conduct of trade or commerce. It is also true, as Mason J observed in Whitfords Beach, supra  (at 537) that there is ambiguity in the adjectives “business”, “commercial” and “trading” which “have about them a chameleon-like hue, readily adapting themselves to their surroundings”. As his Honour said, in some contexts, phrases such as “business deal” and “operation of business” may signify a transaction entered into by a person in the course of carrying on a business; in other contexts they “denote a transaction which is business or commercial in character” (at 537). The same may be said of “commercial” or “trading”. But, in our view, the mere use, by a person not acting in the course of carrying on a business, of facilities commonly employed in commercial transactions, cannot transform a dealing which lacks any business character into something done in trade or commerce. Of course, the facilities mentioned have applications which are not commercial in any sense: advertisements in newspapers and the telephone are used by persons for purposes which are not commercial at all. With all respect to the learned judge, we are not persuaded that resort to them can create the business context required by the reference to “trade or commerce” in s 53A. The conduct complained of was not something done by the appellants in the course of carrying on a business and it lacked trading or commercial character as a transaction. It thus fell outside the scope of s 53A.


	
	In Argy v Blunts & Lane Cove Real Estate Pty Limited (1990) 26 FCR 112, Hill J concluded that the sale of a residence, whether by private treaty or by auction and whether personally or through a real estate agent, was not something done in trade or commerce. His Honour applied the reasoning of the Full Court in O’Brien.
	
	
	By contrast, in Shone v Davies [2012] WASCA 83, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia came to the conclusion that the relevant sale was sufficiently connected to activities of a trading or commercial nature so as to warrant the conclusion that it occurred “in trade or commerce”.
	
	
	Murphy JA (with whom Martin CJ and, relevantly, Buss JA agreed) considered the words “in trade or commerce” and their application at [102] and following. His Honour identified at [105] some eight matters that, at the time the sale was made, the respondents relied upon to justify the conclusion that it occurred in trade or commerce. His Honour agreed. His reasons are found at [108], [111] and [112] (omitting footnotes):
	


[108]   In my view, the matters referred to by the Davies are sufficiently connected in time and subject matter to the grant of the option as to provide relevant context to an assessment of whether the grant of the option occurred in trade or commerce. They formed part of the forensic contest at trial on the question of whether the alleged conduct was in trade or commerce, as is evident from the parties' written submissions at trial and the judge's reasons. They do not go beyond the scope of the matters litigated at trial.

…

[111]   I accept the thrust of the Davies' contention to the effect that the matters identified in [105] above import a commercial character to the grant of the option. The grant of an option is, in itself, typically regarded as a species of commercial transaction. It is a step removed from the ordinary sale and purchase of a home. The language and subject matter of the option deed - a 'call option' in respect of subdivisible property - also import the notion of commerciality into the transaction. The optionor's obligations under the deed were designed to assist the optionee in exploring the potential for, and in obtaining, subdivision of the property. The provision dealing with confidentiality also gives the transaction a commercial character. Further, the transaction falls to be considered in the context of the Shones' related dealings with a land developer and the earlier steps undertaken by the Shones with a view to subdividing the land.

[112]    In these circumstances, it cannot be said, as it was said by the court in O'Brien v Smolonogov, that the grant of the option 'lacked ... commercial character as a transaction'. Nor can it be said, as it was said in Argy v Blunts, that the 'present is purely a case of a person selling his house'. The house here was merely an incidental aspect of the land the subject of the option and was not in any sense a feature of the transaction. Further, none of the matters referred to by the Shones in [106] above assist in shaking off what is essentially the commercial character of the transaction.


	
	In essence, his Honour found that the context in which the transaction was effected and the way in which it was effected – specifically, by the grant of options – gave it a commercial character and removed it “from the ordinary sale and purchase of a home”.
	
	
	In this case, the subject matter of the contract for sale was shares in a company. No doubt there will be cases where the sale of shares does have a commercial character, so as to be something done in trade or commerce. But in this case, the shares carried with them, and were to be bought for the purpose of assuring to Gladio, the right of use and occupation of a home unit. In substance (and I think that the question of characterisation must depend on substance rather than form or technicality), what was sold and bought was a residence. In substance, Ms Buckworth agreed to sell her residence and Gladio agreed to buy it. Gladio did not buy it for commercial exploitation. It was not put to Mr Robbiati that (for example) he was to pay a commercial rent which would assure a commercial return to Gladio on the very substantial amount of money that it was required to pay to acquire the shares.
	
	
	Nor do I see any relevance in the fact that the sale was expressly subject to Mr Robbiati’s tenancy. The property was not sold as an income–producing asset; as I have said, it was not put to Mr Robbiati that he intended, through Gladio, to exploit the income–generating potential of unit 20. It was sold so that Mr Robbiati could continue to enjoy, as “owner” (through Gladio) rather than as tenant, the benefits of use and occupation of unit 20.
	
	
	The reason for making the contract for sale subject to Mr Robbiati’s tenancy was, presumably, to ensure that, since his title as tenant would not merge in his title as owner on completion (because he was not to become the owner), Gladio could not object to the tenancy.
	
	
	In my view, the sale is exactly analogous to the sale of someone’s own residence discussed in Argy, and is a transaction of a private and non-commercial character. Nor do I think that this conclusion changes simply because the purchaser is a company controlled by the individual who proposes to reside in the property, the right to occupy which goes with the subject matter of the sale.
	
	
	It follows that s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law has not been engaged. The claim based on misleading or deceptive conduct must fail.
	
	
	There is no need to analyse the facts to see whether or not there were misleading or deceptive conduct. The relevant facts appear from what I have said already. There is no need to lengthen these reasons by analysing those facts through the statutory lens.
	


Rescission for breach of cl 10(g)


	
	As I have said, this was not a ground for rescission alleged in the notice. However, Mr Lucarelli submitted, on well-known principles, that his client was entitled to rely upon it. Mr Grieve did not appear to contest that proposition. Mr Grieve did however submit that cl 10(g) was not to be regarded as a “condition” of the contract, properly so called.
	
	
	The essence of Gladio’s case on this point is that there must have been some decision or resolution by the directors of Ashdown to accept the terms proposed by Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley in the 24 April 2009 letter. That followed, Mr Lucarelli submitted, because the letter was not in terms referable to the resolution of 31 March 2009. Rather, he submitted, it was a submission of the terms that Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley proposed, in order to satisfy the requirement, specified in the minutes of 31 March 2009, for “[t]he shareholders [to] undertake to address any problems with the air-conditioning such as noise…”.
	
	
	The first point that Mr Lucarelli made was that the letter of 24 April 2009 went well beyond this requirement. It did of course undertake to deal with problems, both generally and in relation to noise. As to problems generally, it acknowledged that the approval could be withdrawn “if problems continue”. And as to noise, it agreed that if necessary “we will install agreed acoustic separation”. However, Mr Lucarelli submitted, the letter went further in at least two ways. First, it acknowledged as a separate matter that the air-conditioning must be removed, at the expense of the shareholders, if the company decided to use the roof space for its own purposes. Second, it specified that the arrangement was to apply to future shareholders and that the House Rules would be amended accordingly.
	
	
	In those circumstances, Mr Lucarelli submitted, there must have been some decision or resolution, because the installation had proceeded, Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley had enjoyed the benefit of the air-conditioning, and the Board had not required them to remove it. In those circumstances, Mr Lucarelli submitted, Ashdown was required to keep a minute, and had not done so. He relied on s 251A(1)(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
	
	
	Mr Grieve submitted that there was no evidence of any decision or resolution, and hence that there was nothing was that required to be recorded by way of minute. He submitted that the question had not been addressed until, admittedly belatedly, the Board turned to it on 28 October 2013. Since that resolution was passed well after the contract for sale was made, nothing turned on it in Mr Grieve’s submission. (His submission would also deal with the alternative date propounded at [101] above.)
	
	
	Although it is not necessary to decide the point, I shall do so, as it was fully argued. It seems to me, on reflection (and contrary to my initial view), that the position for which Mr Lucarelli contends is correct.
	
	
	The first point to note is that the letter speaks in the present tense: Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley “seek consent to utilise the roof space”. As Mr Lucarelli submitted, that is inconsistent with the existence of approval as at 24 April 2009. Likewise, the letter is in terms an “application”: something that would not be necessary had approval been given already.
	
	
	Those linguistic considerations gain force when the letter is put in context. The only evidence of any prior decision of the Board is that contained in the minutes of 31 March 2013. The subject matter of the discussion was the application for approval to the renovations. The Board decided in principle to give approval (that follows, if from nothing else, from the resolution to give consent to the s 96 application). However, there were conditions that remained to be satisfied including, of present importance, the requirement “to address any problems with the air-conditioning such as noise” and the reservation of right “to withdraw the approval… if the problems cannot be resolved”. Read in context, that seems that the consent that had been given was unconditional as to the renovations excluding the air-conditioning; but conditional (and revocable) as to the air-conditioning.
	
	
	Against that background, the letter, dealing as it does specifically with the question of the air-conditioning, should be read as setting out the terms that Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley proposed, in order to satisfy the Board’s requirements. However, those terms go well beyond what is suggested by the resolution. It does not seem to me to be credible that Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley would have offered those extra terms unless there had been specific negotiations with the Board as to the form and content of what it was the Board would find acceptable.
	
	
	When the matter is put in that way, it seems to me to be inescapable that either there was a “done deal” recorded in the terms of the letter (notwithstanding its language), or there was a decision by the Board after 24 April 2009 to accept the terms of the letter as setting out the basis on which the unit 20 shareholders from time to time could use the roof space for the purposes of their air-conditioning equipment. On either analysis, it seems to me, there must have been a “decision”, even if not formally resolved at a meeting, that the terms set out in the letter recorded the terms of use of the roof space for that purpose.
	
	
	If that analysis is correct, there was, as referred to in s 251A(1), a resolution (perhaps of an informal kind, without a meeting), which was required to be minuted. It was not.
	
	
	I should add that it would be quite extraordinary if the matter were left unattended for more than four years, until 13 October 2013. And when the Board did turn its attention (in my view, again) to the question, it did not deal with the terms of the letter of 24 April 2009 at large. It did not, for example, resolve to accept those terms. What it did was, relevantly, to pass the new House Rule 23, which formalised the last matter referred to in the letter: namely, attempting to make the terms of the letter binding on successors on title to Ms Buckworth and Ms Daley.
	
	
	I turn to the proper characterisation of cl 10(g).
	
	
	Mr Grieve submitted that, in contrast to other paragraphs of cl 10, para (g) was not to be characterised as a condition. He relied on the decision of the High Court of Australia in Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council v Sanpine Pty Limited (2007) 233 CLR 115.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli submitted that the parties had contracted that each of the provisions of cl 10 was to have the status of “condition” and that it should be construed accordingly.
	
	
	Although I have set out cl 10(g) above, it is convenient at this point to set out the whole of the clause:
	


10.   Conditions of sale acknowledged by vendor 

The Vendor acknowledges and agrees that it is a condition of this agreement:

(a)   that on completion the Shares will be fully paid up and that no moneys will be owing by the Vendor to any person or corporation in respect thereof, and that the Shares will be free from any lien charge or encumbrance whatsoever;

(b)   that the Vendor will subject to the provisions of this agreement perform all obligations in respect of the Shares up to the date of completion and that any accruing amount or payment due to the Company for which the Vendor or the Purchaser may be liable will be adjusted on completion in accordance with the provisions of this agreement;

(c)   that the land upon which the Unit is erected is the land described in Certificate of Title Identifier 1/79741 or Volume 4325 Folio 161 (“land”) and that the Company will be registered as proprietor of the [land] for an unencumbered estate in fee simple subject only to the notifications, if any, shown on the Certificate of Title at the date of this agreement;

(d)   that the Company is duly incorporated as a Company limited by Shares that it is not in liquidation nor so far as is known to the Vendor, liable to be wound up and that no action is pending in any court for the liquidation of the Company and that so far as is known to the Vendors no meeting has been called or is contemplated for the purpose of winding up the Company and that there are no proceedings pending in any Court against the Company;

(e)   that all liabilities of the Company other than current commitments and accruals have been fully paid and satisfied;

(f)   that until this agreement is completed the Company will not have entered into any agreement deeds contracts or agreements except in the ordinary or normal course of the Company business;

(g)   that the respective registers of members, directors and charges and all other books of the Company required by law to be kept by it are properly kept;

(h)   that the Unit or the Land is not at the date hereof affected by any:

(1)   scheme or proposed scheme under or pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 other than as disclosed in the attached certificate pursuant to s. 149 of that Act;

(2)   road widening (or proposed road widening) scheme of any competent authority or by any other scheme (whether of a like or different nature) of any other competent authority; and

(i)   should the Purchaser before the expiration of the time limited herein for the making of requisitions establish that at the date of this agreement the Land was affected as aforesaid the Purchaser is entitled to rescind this agreement but will not be entitled to make any other objection requisition or claim.


	
	When one looks at the various paragraphs of cl 10, it is apparent that many of them, quite apart from the parties’ express designation of them as “conditions”, are of such significance that they would be so regarded in any event. For example (and this by no means an exhaustive list), para (c) – that Ashdown will own the land and that its interest will be relevantly unencumbered; and para (d) – that Ashdown will neither be in nor liable to be placed in liquidation.
	
	
	The plurality in Koompahtoo (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ) dealt with the question, whether a contractual term should be treated as a condition or a warranty, in the context of breach entitling termination. At [47], their Honours noted that a breach by one party would entitle the other to terminate “where the obligation with which there has been failure to comply has been agreed by the contracting parties to be essential”. Their Honours’ noted that “[s]uch an obligation is sometimes described as a condition”.
	
	
	Their Honours referred to the judgment of Jordan CJ in Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632 at 641–642. In the course of those reasons, Jordan CJ said that:
	


The question whether a term in a contract is a condition or a warranty, i.e., an essential or a non-essential promise, depends upon the intention of the parties as appearing in or from the contract. The test of essentiality is whether it appears from the general nature of the contract considered as a whole, or from some particular term or terms, that the promise is of such importance to the promisee that he would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of a strict or a substantial performance of the promise, as the case may be, and that this ought to have been apparent to the promisor.


	
	Although the plurality in Koompahtoo qualified some aspects of what Jordan CJ said in that passage, they did say at [48] that:
	


It is the common intention of the parties, expressed in the language of their contract, understood in the context of the relationship established by that contract and (in a case such as the present) the commercial purpose it served, that determines whether a term is “essential”, so that any breach will justify termination.


	
	To my mind, both the observations of the plurality at [47], [48] and the observations of Jordan CJ that I have set out above suggest that if parties explicitly agree that a particular contractual term is to be treated as a condition, then, ordinarily at least, the Court will give effect to that agreement. This may be expressed, in terms of construction, by saying that, objectively, the intention of the parties that the term in question should be a “condition” is made manifest by their language.
	
	
	No doubt, there may be cases in which the Court might be justified as treating a so-called “condition” as a warranty only. That might be so, for example, if it were plain that the parties had not had the benefit of legal advice, and if they had used the words “term”, “condition”, “promise”, or “warranty”, and other such expressions, indiscriminately; and if it were plain, objectively, that the particular so-called “condition” was not, and had not been seen to be, essential. This is not such a case. The parties had the benefit of legal advice, of a high standard. The contract was drafted by Ms Buckworth’s solicitor and, presumably, approved by Gladio’s solicitor. The word “condition”, when used in a contract, has a meaning that is well-understood to lawyers. On any view, some of the covenants stated in cl 10 would be treated as “conditions” even if they had not been so described.
	
	
	In my view, the Court should not in this case disregard the clear intention of the parties, manifested objectively by the language of cl 10 read in context, that each of the “conditions” stated in it was to be treated as a condition in the sense described by the plurality in Koompahtoo, and by Jordan CJ in Tramways, in the passages quoted above.
	
	
	In any event, in the context of an agreement for sale of shares, ownership of which gave the right of exclusive occupation of a home unit, I see no reason for treating para (g) in any different way to the other paragraphs of cl 10. The subject matter of the sale is the rights attaching to shares, not real estate. In a very real sense, it seems to me, a purchaser of shares in a company such as Ashdown has a very real and substantial interest in knowing that registers, books and records, which may record matters affecting the extent of and encumbrances or limitations on those rights, are properly kept.
	
	
	It is common experience, and was not in dispute in this case, that prospective purchasers in the position of Gladio will (usually if not always) cause searches of the company’s records to be made before entering into the contract. The purpose of such searches is to give the prospective purchaser information as to factors that might adversely affect either the value of the shares or the enjoyment of the rights attached to them. The efficacy of such searches depends in part on the extent to which resolutions and the like are recorded in the company’s books and records. Of course, such searches cannot be guaranteed to produce that result: either because they may fail to turn up something which was available to be seen (as, it will be seen, is in my view what happened in this case), or because the relevant material was not required to be recorded in the company’s books and records.
	
	
	Making those allowances, it remains the fact that, so far as possible, it is of great importance to prospective purchasers that, in relation to the company’s books and records, what they see is what they get. So regarded, the condition stated in para (g) fits neatly into the scheme of cl 10 as a whole.
	
	
	However one deals with the question, the result in my view is that cl 10(g) did state a condition of the contract: that is to say, a state of affairs, breach of which would give a right of termination. The word “breach” is inapt, since cl 10(g) imposed no obligation on Ms Buckworth. It is, nonetheless, a convenient term to use to describe the non-existence of the state of affairs prescribed by, or non-satisfaction of the requirement stated in, cl 10(g).  
	
	
	Accordingly, were it necessary to do so, I would conclude that Gladio was entitled to “rescind” (or terminate) for breach of cl 10(g). Whether rescission or termination is the correct concept depends on the proper characterisation of cl 10(g), and the consequences of “breach” (in the sense just explained). It is unnecessary to pursue this.
	


Unconscionability; relief against forfeiture of deposit


	
	It is convenient to consider these two claims together, because Mr Lucarelli put the claim for relief against forfeiture of the deposit on the basis that Ms Buckworth’s conduct had been unconscionable to the point where, in conscience, she could not retain the deposit.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli relied both on unconscionability under the general law and on “statutory” unconscionability – that is, s 21 of the Australian Consumer Law.
	
	
	Again, the conduct relied upon is the conduct that I have discussed in connection with the claim for rescission for innocent misrepresentation. I am not sure whether Mr Lucarelli intended to include the evidence relating to requisition 21 and the answer. For reasons that will become apparent, it matters not to my conclusions whether that is or is not included within the range of material relied upon.
	
	
	So far as s 21 is concerned, there is again the requirement that the conduct must have been engaged in “in trade or commerce”. For the reasons I have given, the conduct upon which Mr Lucarelli relied was not conduct “in trade or commerce”.
	
	
	As to general law unconscionability (and leaving aside s 20 of the Australian Consumer Law, which again imports the requirement of “in trade or commerce”), the concept imported by the equitable doctrine of unconscionability is the knowing exploitation of special disadvantage.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli submitted (I think) that there was no requirement to demonstrate special disadvantage, in the sense in which the authorities use that expression. He relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal of this State in Tonto Home Loans Australia Pty Ltd v Tavares [2011] NSWCA 389. Mr Lucarelli relied in particular on what Allsop P said at [291]. His Honour observed that the word “unconscionable” involved concepts such as “a high level of moral obloquy” or must be “irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable”.
	
	
	His Honour was talking of statutory unconscionability: the equivalent of s 21 of the Australian Consumer Law. That is apparent from [291] itself, where his Honour observed that “the concept of unconscionable in this context is wider than the general law and the provisions are intended to build on and not be constrained by cases at general law and equity”.
	
	
	Nothing in the reasons of Allsop P in Tonto Home Loans suggests that the general law requirement for knowing exploitation of special disadvantage has gone by the board.
	
	
	There was no pleading of circumstances that created the necessary relationship of special disadvantage (or the knowing exploitation of that disadvantage). Mr Lucarelli did not seek to identify any such circumstances in his submissions. Accordingly, unless there has been some unheralded change in the equitable doctrines relating to unconscionability, these aspects of Gladio’s case must fail.
	
	
	I directed Mr Lucarelli’s attention to the decision of the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited (2003) 214 CLR 51. In that case, Gleeson CJ surveyed the authorities in his reasons from [6] to [14]. It is enough to say that I think the formulation given by Kitto J in Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362 at 415 remained, so far as Gleeson CJ was concerned, the touchstone:
	


It [the doctrine of unconscionability] applies whenever one party to a transaction is at a special disadvantage in dealing with the other party because illness, ignorance, inexperience, impaired facilities, financial need or other circumstances affect his ability to conserve his own interests, and the other party unconscientiously takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in his hands.


	
	After citing that passage with evident approval at [13], Gleeson CJ said at [14] that:
	


Unconscientious exploitation of another’s inability, or diminished ability, to conserve his or her interests is not to be confused with taking advantage of a superior bargaining position.


	
	At [15], his Honour confirmed the importance of the requirement that there be not merely “disadvantage” but, in the relevant sense, “special disadvantage”:
	


In the present case, there was neither a special disadvantage on the part of the lessees, nor unconscientious conduct on the part of the lessors. All the people involved in the transaction were business people, concerned to advance or protect their own financial interests. The critical disadvantage from which the lessees suffered was that they had no legal entitlement to a renewal or extension of their lease; and they depended upon the lessors’ willingness to grant such an extension or renewal for their capacity to sell the goodwill of their business for a substantial price. They were thus compelled to approach the lessors, seeking their agreement to such an extension or renewal, against a background of current claims and litigation in which they were involved. They were at a distinct disadvantage, but there was nothing “special” about it. They had two forms of financial interest at stake: their claims, and the sale of their business. The second was large; as things turned out, the first was shown to be relatively small. They had the benefit of legal advice. They made a rational decision, and took the course of preferring the second interests. What they lacked was the commercial ability to pursue them both at the same time.


	
	In joint reasons, Gummow and Hayne JJ likewise emphasised the requirement for special disadvantage and knowing exploitation, at [55]:
	


In Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio (77), Mason J referred to passages in the judgments of Fullagar J and Kitto J in Blomley v Ryan (78). Mason J said (79):

“It is made plain enough, especially by Fullagar J, that the situations mentioned are no more than particular exemplifications of an underlying general principle which may be invoked whenever one party by reason of some condition [or] circumstance is placed at a special disadvantage vis-à-vis another and unfair or unconscientious advantage is then taken of the opportunity thereby created. I qualify the word ‘disadvantage’ by the adjective ‘special’ in order to disavow any suggestion that the principle applies whenever there is some difference in the bargaining power of the parties and in order to emphasise that the disabling condition or circumstance is one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his own best interests, when the other party knows or ought to know of the existence of that condition or circumstance and of its effect on the innocent party.”

His Honour went on to emphasise (80) the need for the plaintiff seeking relief to establish the taking of unconscientious advantage of the plaintiff’s disabling condition or circumstance. It will be apparent that the special disadvantage of which Mason J spoke in the passage was one seriously affecting the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to that party’s own best interest.


	
	In circumstances where neither special disadvantage nor knowing exploitation was pleaded, and where the evidence that might support the existence of both those requirements was not addressed in submissions, I conclude that the case based on equitable unconscionability must fail.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Lucarelli put the case for relief against forfeiture fairly and squarely upon unconscionability. Accordingly, that claim too fails.
	


Frustration


	
	Mr Lucarelli relied also on the Frustrated Contracts Act 1978 (NSW).
	
	
	The asserted act of frustration was the Board’s act in resolving to make House Rules 22 and 23 after the contract was made and before it was completed. Mr Lucarelli submitted, in substance, that this had the effect of altering, in a way that was highly disadvantageous to his client, the rights that it had contracted to buy and their value.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission. True it is that the contract for sale was made on the basis of (and included a warranty as to) the articles of association, and the House Rules, as they stood at 16 July 2013. However, there is nothing the articles or in the House Rules that confines the ability of the Board to make new House Rules simply because a shareholder has entered into, but has not completed, a contract for sale of the shares that he or she holds. On the contrary, it is implicit that the power to make and amend House Rules can be exercised at any time. The parties must be taken to have contracted with the knowledge that this could occur.
	
	
	Once it is accepted that the contract was made on a basis which involved recognition of the fact that the House Rules might be amended between contract and completion, there is no warrant for regarding some amendments as frustrating, and others as not.
	
	
	Of course, Gladio could have sought to protect itself. It could have required (for example) a warranty that there would be no amendments to the articles or the House Rules before the date of completion. It is not uncommon in contracts for the sale of shares to see a term to the effect that certain matters are warranted to be correct (or are agreed to be conditions of sale) both at the date of contract and up until and at the date of completion.
	
	
	Whether or not that degree of commercial sophistication should be imputed to their parties (and bearing in mind that each of them had very capable legal advice, there is no reason not to do so), the simple fact is that the risk of amendment of the House Rules is necessarily implicit in the contract, and thus ought not be regarded as an event of frustration.
	
	
	Finally (on this issue) and fundamentally, nothing in those House Rules made further performance of the contract for sale impossible.
	


Gladio’s claims against Ashdown

The claim in negligence 


	
	The first pleaded claim that was pressed was that set out in the FASOC, chapter 9. Two duties of care were pleaded, at FASOC [122], [123]:
	


[122]   Upon receipt of that application for its consent to the proposed transfer of the shares, Ashdown came under a duty of care to Gladio to ensure that all communications relating to the issue of it granting its consent sent by Ashdown or on its behalf were accurate and not misleading.

[123]   Further, or in the alternative upon receipt of that application for its consent to the proposed transfer of the Shares, Ashdown came under a duty of care to Gladio to ensure that all communications by it or on its behalf in relation to Ashdown’s consent were duly authorised.


	
	However, it is apparent from FASOC [127] that the only duty of care said to have been breached is that pleaded at [122]:
	


[127]   If, which is denied, it is found that Ashdown had given its consent prior to the Consent Date and that, as a result, Gladio was not entitled to rescind pursuant to clause 6.1, then by causing, allowing or permitting STCM [sic] to send the 10 and 19 September 2013 letters asserting Ashdown had not yet consented, Ashdown breached its duty of care to Gladio.

            Particulars 

   If, which is denied, it is found that Ashdown had given its consent prior to the Consent Date, then STCM’s [sic] 10 and 19 September 2013 letters asserting Ashdown had not yet consented were not accurate and were in fact misleading.


	
	The letter of 10 September 2013 was sent by SCTM to Mr Robbiati. There is no doubt that it was sent on the instructions on Ashdown; indeed, I think, it was drafted by Mr Bell.
	
	
	At one point in that letter (the purpose of which was to set out Ashdown’s position in relation to the letter of 24 April 2009, and to invite discussions as to the form of House Rules 22 and 23), SCTM (or Ashdown through SCTM) said:
	


…

If it was not disclosed to you (whether in the contract or otherwise), that is not the fault of the Board or any member of it. The Board at the time in 2009 granted an indulgence to the then owners of Unit 20 to install the air conditioning equipment on common property on the terms in the letter. There is no right to exclusive use as a result. To grant you such a right would be in effect to appropriate common property to the shareholders in respect of Unit 20. The directors have great difficulty seeing how this could be justified in the interests of the company as a whole, even assuming it is within their powers.


	
	At the end of that letter, SCTM (or Ashdown) said:
	


…

As things presently stand, the directors have required that you correspond in relation to the air conditioning issue through us, SCTM, the managing agent engaged by Ashdown to receive and process such correspondence. Finally, all of the directors have requested that we convey their sincere hope that should the transfer of the shares to Gladio Pty Limited be approved, and you continue as a resident of Ashdown, it will be possible for everyone at Ashdown to put this behind them and enjoy good neighbourly relations for the years to come.


	
	The letter of 19 September 2013 responded to a letter sent by Mr Robbiati on 16 September 2013. In that letter, Mr Robbiati set out his view of the relevant background circumstances, and what he said was the substance of a conversation with Mr Bell. He then identified what he said were “the issues at hand” and proposed a way of dealing with those issues.
	
	
	The letter of 19 September 2013 stated that “the directors do not propose to respond to each of the matters you raise in detail”. Having said that, it made a number of points. The first was:
	


At the present point in time, your company is not a shareholder. The transfer of shares to your company is not yet approved. The directors do not understand how, as a prospective shareholder, your company would have any right to be consulted about real changes.


	
	Since both those letters were said to be “without prejudice”, there was an argument as to their admissibility. I give my reasons for concluding that the letters should be admitted in part (and explain why, ultimately, they were received in full) at [355] to [371] below.
	
	
	In essence, Gladio’s case was that each of the letters amounted to a negligent misstatement because it said (either by necessary implication or expressly) that the transfer of shares to Gladio had not been approved, whereas in truth it had been approved.
	
	
	Of course, this sits less than squarely with Gladio’s primary case: namely, that there was no sufficient approval. However, the claim against Ashdown was brought in the alternative to the claim against Ms Buckworth. For that reason, the claim against Ashdown does not really arise for consideration. Nonetheless, I propose to continue what I have started, and deal with it.
	
	
	Ashdown’s first line of defence was that it owed no duty of care to Gladio. In my view, that submission was well-founded. On any view, the duty alleged is one to avoid the suffering of pure economic loss. Vulnerability, as a touchstone of the existence of such a duty, has been recognised very recently in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288 (2014) 313 ALR 408.
	
	
	Mr Lucarelli did not contest the proposition that vulnerability, in the relevant sense, was necessary for the duty of care pleaded in FASOC [122]. He did however submit that the duty of care pleaded in FASOC [123] was founded on express assumption of responsibility and known reliance, and submitted that this was a separate basis for finding the existence of a duty of care. As I have observed, the only pleaded and particularised breach is of the duty of care pleaded in FASOC [122].
	
	
	Mr Izzo of Counsel, who appeared for Ashdown, referred to the decision of the High Court in Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board (2001) 206 CLR 1. In that case, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ (who with Gaudron J formed the majority) dealt with the concept of assumption of responsibility and known reliance at [47] to [49]. Their Honours said that, if the law were to impose a duty of care on someone who provides information or advice, there were two particular matters that must be demonstrated. The first was that the speaker did realise, or the circumstances should be such that the speaker ought realise, that the recipient proposed to act on the information or advice in connection with some serious matter. The second factor was that it must be reasonable in all the circumstances for the recipient to seek advice and to rely upon it when given.
	
	
	In my view, Gladio was not relevantly vulnerable. It knew that it could not become registered as owner of the shares unless the Board approved it, and directed registration of the transfer to it. It knew that Board approval could not be taken for granted. (This must be so a fortiori in the particular case, where to Mr Robbiati’s knowledge a number of residents had expressed concern at aspects of his use of the premises during his tenancy.) Thus, Gladio must have known that the contract between it and Ms Buckworth needed to contain provisions that would protect it in the event that approval was withheld. The contract did in fact contain such a provision.
	
	
	If (as Ms Buckworth submitted) the Board had given approval to Gladio as a purchaser, for the purposes of article 41(d), then that was the end of the matter. Thus, if the email of 9 August 2013 did constitute an approval, the requirements of cl 6.1 would have been satisfied. I say that because, if approval had been given, it could not later be withheld or withdrawn (except perhaps – I need express no view – in circumstances such as fraud). This follows from para (d) itself which, when empowering the directors to decline to register a transfer to a transferee of whom they do not approve, excludes from the power to decline those whom they have “previously resolved is approved as suitable to be a member of the company”.
	
	
	However, if it were thought that there were some risk that approval once given might be taken away, it would have been a simple matter to word cl 6.1 by including a requirement that the approval once given should not be withdrawn or retracted. That was not done – perhaps because the lawyers recognised that once approval was given, that was the end of the matter.
	
	
	Regardless, the question is whether there was relevant vulnerability. Mr Lucarelli pointed out, correctly, that his client was dependent on Ashdown to make a decision, and submitted that it was “vulnerable” to intimations of a change in that decision. Again, I do not agree. As I have said, that is something that could have been covered in the contract for sale were it thought to be a real problem.
	
	
	Further, if there were intimations that the Board proposed to withdraw an approval that had been given, Gladio was well able to deal with that situation. It had ready access to legal advice, and ready access to Ashdown’s Articles of Association.
	
	
	Thus, in my view, Ashdown owed no duty of care to Gladio.
	
	
	It follows that the claim in negligence must fail for this reason. However, in my view, it must also fail on the facts. There are at least four reasons for this.
	
	
	First, the letters do not say in terms that any approval that had been given has been withdrawn. The letter of 10 September 2013 is premised on the absence of final approval, but does not state that the approval which (on Ms Buckworth’s case) had been given, was withdrawn.
	
	
	The letter of 19 September 2013 makes the point that Gladio is not a shareholder (unarguably correct), and states that the transfer has not been approved. Again, it does not say that any approval given is withdrawn.
	
	
	In substance, each of those letters attributes a particular characterisation to SCTM’s 9 August 2013 email. Neither says that if approval were given by that email, it was revoked.
	
	
	The second and related reason is that, objectively, the letters did not mis-state the position at all, because on the view to which I have come of the email of 9 August 2013, there was no approval for the purposes of cl 6.1. Translating that into the dispute between Gladio and Ashdown, there was no sufficient approval, so that the statements as to absence or want of approval were not inaccurate. Nor is that analysis affected because, subjectively, Ashdown’s position (or the position of its directors) at the time was that there was no complete or final approval, because there had been no interview.  
	
	
	The third reason is that in my view, Mr Robbiati did not rely on the statements in those letters. Further, if he did so rely, it could not have been reasonable.
	
	
	If the 9 August 2013 email did amount to a sufficient approval for the purposes of cl 6.1, Mr Robbiati or his legal advisers must have appreciated that, on the proper construction of article 41(d), it was not open to Ashdown to revoke that approval. If they overlooked this aspect of article 41(d), that is not something for which Ashdown should bear responsibility.
	
	
	Mr Robbiati’s evidence of reliance was exiguous; and what little there was, was not credible. The starting point is that the letter of 10 September 2013 was not even mentioned in the notice of rescission. This suggests that it could not have figured in the thinking that led to the giving of that notice. Indeed, when Mr Robbiati replied to the 10 September letter on 16 September 2013, he did not make any reference to the assertion that approval had not been given.
	
	
	Mr Robbiati’s affidavits made no mention of reliance on either or both of the letters as a factor in his decision to cause Gladio to rescind the contract for sale. The only evidence on the issue to which Mr Lucarelli could point came out in cross-examination. Although Mr Lucarelli relied on that evidence, it was in my view directed to a different issue.
	
	
	Mr Robbiati said that he did not believe Gladio had received consent to the transfer of the shares (T70.6-.11):
	


Q.   What were the other reason ‑ or what was the other reason or reasons for your decision to have Gladio purportedly rescind the share sale agreement?

A.     I believe I never received from Ashdown consent for the actual transfer of the shares to take place and that was a condition precedent in the sales agreement that was not fulfilled and that is one of the main reasons why I decided that Gladio should rescind the contract.


	
	If that were his state of mind, the letters of 10 and 19 September could have had no effect but to confirm it.
	
	
	A little later in his cross-examination, Mr Robbiati equivocated on this point. He was questioned about an email he sent on 19 September 2013 to Mr Day. In that email, Mr Robbiati forwarded to Mr Day the letter of 19 September 2013. He said of it:
	


…

Please see the attached letter. What is interesting is that they are saying that the transfer of shares to Gladio is NOT approved by the Board of the Company, therefore this has implications in relation to the Notice to complete and the deadline of 28 September that was imposed on us by Virginia and Chris. I think we need to hold firm and reiterate that we are surprised at the assertion that the share transfer was not approved. We were told it was approved subject to the Rules which have been significantly amended, between signing and completion.

…


	
	Of course, Mr Robbiati’s primary position was that there was no approval; that the email of 9 August 2013 did not give approval. Clearly, it could be thought that what he said, in the paragraph of his email of 19 September that I have just set out, was inconsistent. He suggested first of all that he was confused, and that his email of 19 September should not be read as suggesting that he knew or believed that Gladio had been approved as a purchaser (T74.10-.34). However, he accepted that his email to Mr Day “probably… should be read” as saying that he had been told that the transfer was approved subject to the House Rules. Nonetheless, he maintained at the end of this passage of his cross-examination that he found it “highly ambiguous”. I set out the whole of this passage of his evidence (T74.10-75.39):
	


Q.    The email from Mr Green says that, ""The board of directors of Ashdown has given approval to the above sale proceeding provided you instruct your client of the amended rules and regulations here attached.""  You agreed with me earlier that you had seen that email at about the time it was sent to Mr Day, do you remember that?

A.     Yeah.

Q.     So that when you say in the 19 September email ""we were told it was approved subject to the rules"", that is presumably isn't it a reference to what you had been told by Mr Green through Day Legal?

A.     No, because there was prior to the email of 9 August there was discussion as to whether or not the transfer of shares to the company could be authorised and approved.  And that appeared to have been cleared and when I drafted that email on 19 September I was referring to that issue not necessarily ‑ and I'll come back to this ‑ to whether the actual transfer of shares to Gladio was actually approved.  I found the email of 9 August incredibly confusing because Mr Lane was not my solicitor and he was asked to instruct his clients.  That can't be me because he wasn't acting for me, on the amended rules and regulations here attached, in particular rule 23.  And rule 23 refers to shareholding by a corporation hence my confusion when I read the 9 August 2013 email from Mr Green.  So I hope I gave you an understanding of why I am confused as to whether it's the approval of a transfer of shares to a company that has been approved, which I'm told it was, or whether the actual transfer of the shares was approved, which in my mind in the letter of 19 September I'm told it's not.

HIS HONOUR

Q.     Mr Robbiati, if you look at your email of 19 September?

A.     Yeah.

Q.     The second sentence says that, ""they"" presumably Ashdown ""are saying that the transfer of shares to Gladio is not approved by the board of the company"", is that correct?

A.     Yes, your Honour.

Q.     And then in the last sentence in the first paragraph you say, ""We were told it was approved subject to the rules"", et cetera.  The ""it"" that you were told is approved was clearly the transfer of shares to Gladio, wasn't it?

A.     You can take it like this, your Honour, but I was incredibly confused by the whole sequence of events.

Q.     The plain reading of a letter as I see it is that the ""it"" refers back to the transfer of shares to Gladio.  Are you saying that the letter should or should not be read that way?

A.     The letters says that a transfer of shares to Gladio is not approved.

Q.     Yes, and then you say two sentences later?

A.     Yes.

Q.     ""We were told it was approved"".  What I am saying is, that I understand that letter to mean that you were told that the transfer of shares to Gladio was approved subject to the rules?

A.     Yes.

Q.     Are you saying that's not how it should be read?

A.     Well it's probably how it should be read.

Q.     Yes, well whereabouts was the approval given to which you refer in the sentence, ""We were told it was approved""?

A.     There were a number of phone calls, conversations between the conveyance lawyers and this notion that ‑ and there were actually phone calls with the real estate agents as a matter of fact, and that's what I am referring to.  And yes, there is this 9 August email which I found highly ambiguous, that is part of the context, your Honour.

Q.     While I am interfering, you were asked to assume that the attached letter referred to in the first sentence of your email was the letter at tab 138.  Does it accord with your recollection that is the letter you are referring to?

A.     Certainly, yes, that I agree.

IZZO

Q.     May I ask you a further question about this, Mr Robbiati?  Can I suggest to you that the only fair reading of the sentence that we have been looking at, ""We were told it was approved subject to the rules"", which have been amended, a fair reading, the only fair reading of that is that you believed on 19 September that Gladio had been previously told that the transfer to it of Ms Buckworth's shares have been approved subject to the rules.  Do you agree with that?

A.     Yes, I agree with that.


	
	I interpolate that, if this were Mr Robbiati’s understanding at the time then, properly advised (as to article 41(d)), he could not rationally have regarded either of the September letters as withdrawing or revoking approval. A fortiori, he could not rationally have relied on those letters as a ground for rescinding on the basis of want of approval.
	
	
	Mr Robbiati then gave the following evidence, which Mr Lucarelli said was evidence of reliance (T75.45-76.19):
	


Q.   Ultimately you rescinded the share sale agreement on bases that included the fact that in the 19 September letter Ashdown indicated that it had not given its consent to the transfer. Do you agree with that?

A.    I agree with that.

Q.    You took that step without first asking Ashdown of what the reasons were for the inconsistency between the 19 September letter and what you had previously been told about the transfer being approved subject to the rules, didn't you?

A.     May I ask you to rephrase the question, Mr Izzo?

Q.     Yes.  You took the step of rescinding the share sale agreement on bases that included what is contained in the first dash point of the 19 September letter without first asking Ashdown for the reasons for the inconsistency between that first dash point and what you had been previously told about the transfer having been approved subject to the rules?

LUCARELLI: I object to that.  Relevance, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I allow the question.

WITNESS:    So the answer to your question is I made the decision ‑ I'm paraphrasing it ‑ I made a decision to rescind the contract on the basis of what was contained in the 19 September letter without checking with Ashdown as regard to the inconsistency between that letter and prior communications.


	
	When one puts that passage in context, it is in my view clear that Mr Robbiati was accepting the proposition that one of the grounds given for rescission was the statement contained in the letter of 19 September 2013 to which his attention had been drawn. That is a long way from saying that, subjectively, he relied on the truth of that statement as a basis for rescinding the contract.
	
	
	To my mind, this whole passage of Mr Robbiati’s evidence is lacking in credibility. Mr Robbiati impressed me as an intelligent man. I think that he perceived the conflict between his primary case and his email to Mr Day of 19 September 2013, and that he sought to tailor his answers to accommodate that difficulty.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Robbiati gave no evidence in chief to the effect that, subjectively, he relied on the letter of 19 September 2013 (or on the earlier letter, or on them both) as a factor that led him to cause Gladio to rescind the contract for sale. If that were his case, it should have been supported by evidence in chief so that Ashdown in particular could have an adequate opportunity of meeting it. In those circumstances, and repeating my observations as to the lack of credibility of this aspect of his evidence, I do not think that evidence directed to a different purpose, which in any event does not squarely confront the issue, should be accepted as sufficient to prove reliance.
	
	
	Mr Izzo submitted that Gladio would have rescinded the contract for sale in any event, regardless of the question of consent or the purported withdrawal of a consent that had purportedly been given. That is correct. However, as Mr Lucarelli submitted, if the reasons for rescission did include (contrary to my finding) reliance on the letters of 10 and 19 September 2013, the fact that there were other causal factors would not break the chain of causation.
	
	
	The fourth reason why, in any event, Gladio’s claim in negligence fails is based on Mr Izzo’s “Tepko” submission. It is necessary to identify the purpose for which the letters were sent, and the context in which they were sent, to see whether Ashdown should have realised that Gladio intended to rely on the communications and the purposes for which Gladio would rely. That will inform both Ashdown’s appreciation of the significance of what it was saying and analysis of the question of reasonableness.
	
	
	The letters were sent to and fro in the course of the parties’ discussion of the letter of 24 April 2009 and House Rule 22. Mr Robbiati’s concern, and complaint, was that his enjoyment of the benefit of the air-conditioning might be curtailed summarily and for any reason. The directors of Ashdown were seeking to meet that concern. No doubt, that is why they invited Mr Robbiati to submit a form of rule that would be acceptable to him.
	
	
	It was in that context that Ashdown sought to make the point that, as a prospective shareholder only, Gladio had no right to be consulted when House Rule 22 was made. The thrust of its correspondence was directed at rebutting Mr Robbiati’s complaints about non-consultation. It was not directed at questioning whether or not approval had been given at all (and I accept, as Mr Izzo submitted, that subjectively the directors did not believe that unconditional approval had been given at that point).
	
	
	It may be correct to say that, in relation to the air-conditioning, the directors should have realised that Mr Robbiati might rely and act upon what they said. It could not be correct to say that they should have realised that he would rely and act upon it for a totally different purpose: namely, to rescind the agreement because approval to the transfer had not been given.
	
	
	Before leaving the topic of negligence, I should note that Mr Izzo submitted that Gladio did not suffer loss by reason of the rescission. He relied on the fact that, on 12 November 2013, the directors resolved to honour the terms of the 9 August 2013 email, and waived the interview requirement. That decision was communicated to Mr Day on 12 November 2013. It said, among many other things:
	


Having now become aware of [the statement in the 9 August 2013 email] having been made, they consider they should no longer require the usual interview, as that statement having been made to Ms Buckworth’s solicitors by STCM [sic], it should, in the circumstances, be honoured by the directors. They have now approved the transfer of shares to Gladio.


	
	The notice of rescission was given on 26 September 2013. Once that notice was given, Mr Lane sent an email to Mr Greene referring to the notice and to the email of 9 August 2013. He said:
	


Please issue a notice that retracts any statement that the transfer of shares from my client to Gladio… is not approved immediately given that is not the case and that the directors had approved the sale transfer on 9 August 2013.


	
	However, on the same day, Mr Lane wrote to Mr Day, stating that Ms Buckworth treated the notice of rescission as a repudiation, and terminated the contract for that repudiation and forfeited the deposit.
	
	
	If the notice of rescission did constitute a repudiation of the contract for sale (and for the reasons I have given, it did not) then the acceptance of that repudiation and termination in reliance upon it brought the contract for sale to an end. Accordingly, by 12 November 2013, there was in that hypothetical universe no extant contract for sale which could have been performed.
	
	
	Were it necessary to decide, I would conclude in any event that the claim against Ashdown must fail.
	


The claim for misleading or deceptive conduct 


	
	Gladio said, in the alternative, that the facts relied upon in support of its negligence case against Ashdown gave rise to a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct. Again, that claim invoked s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law.
	
	
	In my view, the relevant actions of Ashdown, in causing the letters of 10 and 19 September 2013 to be sent, did not amount to conduct in trade or commerce.
	
	
	Ashdown was the proprietor of the home unit complex. Its function was to maintain and manage the building for the amenity of residents. It did not make a profit from that activity. Ashdown acted gratuitously in dealing with the consideration of Gladio’s application, and in its correspondence with Gladio more generally. It derived no revenue from that activity.
	
	
	In not dissimilar circumstances, in E v Australian Red Cross Society (1991) 27 FCR 310, Wilcox J said that the gratuitous supply of blood to hospitals was not something done in trade or commerce (at 350). To my mind, that is the position in this case also.
	
	
	Were I wrong in this, I would conclude, nonetheless, that the conduct in question was not misleading or deceptive. In essence, the reasons follow from what I have said.
	
	
	First, when one considers the context in which the letters were sent, they were dealing with the dispute over the air-conditioning and House Rules 22 and 23. They were not dealing with the question of whether the Board of Ashdown had approved Gladio as a purchaser. The statements contained in the letters as to want of approval should be read in that context.
	
	
	Second, if it were Gladio’s position and understanding that approval had been given under article 41(d), it must have appreciated that the approval could not in effect be revoked (again, with the possible exception of circumstances such as fraud; and I stress that there is no suggestion of fraud in this case). Thus, it could not have been reasonable for Gladio to rely on the statements as to want of approval in determining to act as it did, and give notice of rescission.
	
	
	Third, and again for the reasons I have given, Gladio did not in fact rely on those statements for that purpose. If that were its case, it was incumbent on Mr Robbiati to give evidence in chief directed to reliance. He did not do so. And this cannot be said to be a case where it was obvious, or likely, or intended, that Mr Robbiati would rely on those statements for the purpose of rescinding the contract for sale on the ground of want of approval.
	


Further but withdrawn allegation 


	
	I should note that Gladio had alleged also a separate duty of care, to comply with its statutory obligations and obligations under the articles to keep proper records of resolutions and the like, to make all such minutes available for inspection, and to make available for inspection the letter of 24 April 2009. That was part of the withdrawn claims pleaded in chapter 10 of FASOC. It is not necessary to consider it, although for the reasons I give below, I conclude that both the minutes of 31 March 2009 and the letter of 24 April 2009 were made available for inspection to Ms Kritikos.
	


Ashdown’s defence of compromise


	
	Ashdown submitted that it had reached a binding agreement for compromise with Gladio. It sought, by notice of motion, specific performance of that alleged agreement.
	
	
	The evidence was confined to three affidavits made by the solicitors involved: two by Mr Dillon, for Ashdown; and one by Mr Super, for Gladio.
	
	
	There was no cross-examination of either deponent.
	
	
	The only issue was whether the “deal” that undoubtedly they struck was one intended to be immediately binding, or intended to become binding only on the execution of formal documents giving effect to it.
	
	
	Since there is no dispute as to the facts, and the evidence falls within a very narrow compass, I will not take this matter any further.
	


Ms Buckworth’s cross-claim against Gladio


	
	Ms Buckworth cross-claimed against Gladio for damages for breach of contract. That cross-claim was withdrawn during the trial.
	


Ms Buckworth’s cross-claim against Ashdown


	
	Ms Buckworth seeks contribution or indemnity from Ashdown, in the event (which has happened, or will in due course happen) that Gladio’s claim against her succeeds. Her cross-claim is based on terms alleged to be found in what she calls the “constitutional contract”: the contract between her and Ashdown formed pursuant to s 140 of the Corporations Act. As the case was put in final submissions, some four separate terms were relied upon: two implied, and two express.
	
	
	As to the alleged implied terms, the starting point seems to me to be that the Court should be slow to imply terms into such a contract. The reasons why this is so were explained by Young J in Stanham v National Trust of Australia (NSW) (1989) 15 ACLR 87 at 90–91.
	
	
	The first reason that his Honour gave was that “it is far more difficult to imply a term in a case where parties have purportedly spelt out their rights and obligations in an extensive set of articles than it is where there is only a very summarised version of such rights and obligations”.
	
	
	The second reason given was that “it is customary in corporations to place very great store on the actual wording of each of the articles and very often parties govern themselves on the exact grammatical construction of each individual article”.
	
	
	The third reason given was the power of companies to amend their constitutions by special resolution. His Honour said that for this reason even if “there is a defect in the rules rather than imply a term the Court may very well leave the parties to have the majority pass the appropriate resolution”.
	
	
	In the present case, two of the implied terms relied upon relate to topics that are expressly dealt with in the articles.
	
	
	The first implied term is said to be that Ashdown would maintain records such as the 24 April 2009 letter and other records relating to the unit 20 roof space. However, the articles deal with record-keeping in article 118. In my view, bearing in mind both the general principles relating to implication of contractual terms and the specific matters relevant to corporations to which Young J referred in Stanham, the Court should not imply a term additional to, although dealing with the same general topic covered by, article 118.
	
	
	The second implied term is said to be that the Board must, on receipt of a reasonable request for transfer of shares, hold a meeting and promptly resolve to approve the transfer. It may be accepted that when a request for approval is received, the Board should deal with it promptly. As I have said, it is clear that the individual members of the Board would have appreciated that contracts for the sale of shares in the capital of Ashdown typically required consent to be given by a particular date (although there is no reason to think that they knew of the precise provisions and date in the contract between Ms Buckworth and Gladio). However, to say that the Board was required promptly to pass a resolution approving the transfer is inconsistent with article 41(d). That article expressly (and without any express qualification) permits the Board to refuse to register a transfer to a person who has not previously been approved and of whom it does not approve.
	
	
	The third term relied on is an express one: namely, the provision of article 41(d), to which I have referred already, to the effect that the Board cannot refuse to approve someone who it has previously resolved to approve as a suitable member of the company.
	
	
	In this context, too, I note that the correspondence relied upon did not purport to refuse or withdraw approval; it noted that approval had not yet been given. There was thus no breach of article 41(d). Mr Grieve did not submit that the approval of Mr Robbiati as a tenant meant that the Board could not withhold approval of Gladio as a shareholder.
	
	
	The fourth term relied on is article 118. However, the case misconstrues that article. It was said that article 118 imposes an obligation on Ashdown to keep minutes of meetings of directors. That is not correct. The obligation is imposed on the directors. If the directors fail to perform that obligation, that failure might be actionable at the suit of Ashdown. However, there would be no contractual right in members to have the article enforced, let alone a remedy in damages for alleged breach. I refer again to the decision of Young J in Stanham, at 90. His Honour said:
	


If one elevated every matter in the articles of association of a company to the status of a contractual right vested in each and every member the rule in Foss v Harbottle… would be able to be completely disregarded. The whole effect of that rule, despite the growth of exceptions, is that ordinarily the Court does not interfere at the suit of a member with an alleged wrong done with respect to administration of the company. True it is that it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between an individual right and a representative right…; nonetheless the rule for the most part prevails.


	
	In this case, the line is not at all difficult to draw. It is plain that article 118 confers no right on individual members.
	
	
	For those reasons (which do not exhaust the whole of the arguments on the point) Ms Buckworth’s cross-claim against Ashdown must fail.
	


Ashdown’s cross-claim against SCTM


	
	The premise of this cross-claim was that Gladio succeeded in its case against Ashdown. Since I have concluded that its case fails, it follows that the cross-claim should be dismissed. However, since the facts are not clear, I will deal with it as briefly as may properly be done.
	
	
	The case that Ashdown advanced against SCTM was summarised in para 64 of Mr Izzo’s closing written submissions. I set out that paragraph, omitting the footnoted reference to Astley v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1:
	


Gladio’s alternative claim based on the 10 and 19 September 2013 letters 

64.   If Gladio succeeds in its alternative case alleging negligence or misleading and deceptive conduct against Ashdown arising from the sending of the 10 and 19 September 2013 letters, Ashdown seeks to recover from SCTM any loss it suffers as a result. This aspect of the cross-claim is based on the contention that SCTM breached contractual and tortious duties of care owed to Ashdown by reason of the following:

a.   on 9 August 2013, Ashdown instructed Mr Greene by email to notify Ms Buckworth that Ashdown had approved the transfer of shares to Gladio subject to interview (CB Tab 94);

b.   Mr Greene appreciated that Mr Lane had been chasing a response to Ms Buckworth’s application for a transfer of her shares and that it was a matter of some significance to him to know what the Board was going to say about the application (Tr 196.39-42). He also appreciated that he needed to take care in sending any communication of importance to outsiders to ensure that what he said accurately conveyed Ashdown’s position (Tr 193.4-14);

c.   despite this, Mr Greene proceeded to inform Mr Lane that Ashdown had approved the transfer of shares to Gladio, without informing her [sic] that the approval which Ashdown had given was subject to interview (CB tab 98);

d.   at no time before November 2013 did Mr Greene say to Mr Lee or any other director that in his 9 August 2013 email he had omitted to mention to Mr Lane that the Board’s approval was subject to interview (Tr 200.5-22). This is despite the fact that

(i)   Mr Greene had received Mr Lane’s email of 22 August 2013 stating “My client appreciates that the Board approved the transfer of her shares to Gladio Pty Ltd” (CB tab 111, p 863) and knew that assertion was incorrect (Tr 201.20-21)

(ii)   Mr Greene accepted he would have read Mr Bell’s email (CB tab 111, p 225) asking him to indicate what had been communicated to the vendor and purchaser about the sale (Tr 203.17-18);

e.   Mr Greene subsequently sent the 10 and 19 September 2013 letters without first notifying Ashdown that, in so far as those letters suggested that Ashdown had not given its consent to the proposed transfer of shares to Gladio, they were inconsistent with the terms of the 9 August 2013 email. That is in circumstances where Mr Greene had read, at least, the text of the 19 September 2013 letter before he sent it (Tr 205.22-23).    


	
	I accept that SCTM owed the duties alleged (and this was not in dispute). The question is, did it breach them:
	



	
	by sending the 9 August 2013 email without stating that the approval was subject to interview?
	
	
	By sending the letters of 10 and 19 September 2013 without first warning Ashdown that they were inconsistent with the terms of the 9 August 2013?
	



	
	There was also a question as to whether SCTM had breached its duties to Ashdown by failing to make available to Ms Kritikos the letter of 24 April 2009.
	


Breach of duty in relation to correspondence?


	
	Ms Horvath of Counsel, who appeared for SCTM, submitted (and I agree) that the 9 August 2013 email should be viewed in context. Much of that context has been set out already. She submitted that it should have been apparent to everyone, including Mr Robbiati, from that context that the Board had not intended to waive, nor had it waived, the requirement for an interview.
	
	
	The starting point for analysis is that Mr Greene did not act in accordance with his instructions when he sent the 9 August 2013 email, because he did not include in it a statement that the approval was subject to interview. Whether or not Mr Lane (or for that matter Mr Day) should have appreciated that the approval would in any event be subject to interview is beyond the point. Mr Greene was given an express instruction to state that the approval was subject to interview. This he failed to do.
	
	
	Further, Mr Greene was made aware a few days later (on 12 August 2013) that both Mr Lane and Mr Day regarded SCTM’s 9 August 2013 email as evidencing approval of Gladio as the transferee of the shares. That awareness must have come from Day Legal’s email to Mr Greene of 12 August 2013 forwarding documents to be completed or executed by Ashdown. That was sent as part of a chain of emails which included Mr Lane’s email to Mr Day earlier on 12 August 2013, forwarding Mr Greene’s email of 9 August 2013, and noting “that your client has been approved as transferee of the shares”.
	
	
	Mr Greene forwarded the documents onto Ashdown for execution. He did not tell Ashdown that both Ms Buckworth and Gladio took the view that Gladio had been approved as transferee. He did not disabuse Hunt & Hunt or Day Legal of the notion that unconditional approval had been given. He did not tell them that he had made a mistake, and that the approval had been given subject to interview. Had he done so, there was ample time for the interview to be conducted prior to 23 August 2013.
	
	
	Ms Horvath’s submissions addressed s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). There is no doubt that s 5B (and succeeding sections) are relevant: see s 5A. Ms Horvath submitted that the relevant risk of harm was “that Ashdown would suffer loss if SCTM did not identify in the 9 August email that the approval was subject to interview” (compare Gummow J in Roads and Traffic Authority v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [59]).
	
	
	In my view, that may misdescribe the relevant risk of harm. The risk of harm may be that Ashdown would suffer loss if Ms Buckworth and Gladio proceeded on the assumption that unconditional approval had been given, rather than that the approval was subject to interview. However, in the event, I am not sure that it matters whether what I have just said is the correct characterisation of the risk, or whether it is to be characterised as Ms Horvath submitted it should be.
	
	
	In terms of s 5B(1)(a), the foreseeable risk of harm, following from the failure to disclose that the approval was subject to interview, was that Ashdown would be held to an unconditional approval: that is to say, that it would be required to accept as an “owner” / occupant, someone whom it had not been able to interview and of whom it might well disapprove. To my mind, that risk was not insignificant, and was one against which precautions could easily have been taken. However, even if Ashdown had lost the opportunity of interviewing Mr Robbiati, and even if it were forced to accept him as an “owner” / occupant, it is difficult to see how any recoverable loss could have followed from those matters. (One might think that the more likely loss would have been suffered by SCTM: being dismissed, for failing to comply with its instructions, as a result of which Ashdown was saddled with an “owner” / occupant of whom it did not, subjectively, approve.)
	
	
	Were it necessary to decide the point, I would conclude that SCTM did owe a duty of care to Ashdown, to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the email of 9 August 2013 accurately reflected the instructions given by Ashdown to SCTM. However, it would not follow from that the foreseeable damages flowing from breach of that duty would include such amount (if any) as Ashdown might be ordered to pay to Gladio or Ms Buckworth, as the case may be, arising out of the termination of the contract for sale.
	
	
	The second alleged duty relates to the letters of 10 and 19 September 2013. Ashdown says that SCTM should have appreciated that the statements in those letters, concerning the want of approval, was inconsistent with the actual position.
	
	
	Cutting to the chase, I do not accept that there was such a duty. The reason is simple. The two statements as to want of approval formed part of longer and more complex letters. The letters were dealing (and SCTM should have seen them as dealing) not with approval, but with a different question: namely, the disputes in relation to air-conditioning and House Rule 22.
	
	
	Further, SCTM had passed on to the directors of Ashdown both its own email of 9 August 2013 and a letter from Mr Lane asserting that, by reason of that email, unconditional approval had been given for the shares to be transferred to Ashdown.
	
	
	The directors of Ashdown included a number of lawyers. One would expect that they would read with some care correspondence passed onto them, particularly where that correspondence related to something that was quite clearly the subject matter of dispute. In my view, Mr Greene and through him SCTM were entitled to think that they had sufficiently apprised Ashdown of the view that consent had been given, and were not required to point out specifically the import of the correspondence that Mr Greene had passed on to the directors.
	
	
	In addition, it is clear that the relationship between Ashdown and SCTM was that, in all matters of significance, Ashdown would give instructions to SCTM, extending to drafting letters for SCTM to cut and paste and then send out on its own letterhead. The suggestion that it was part of SCTM’s functions to vet such letters to ensure that they were accurate is not persuasive.
	
	
	Of course, if SCTM were left to draft the letters as it chose, or at its discretion, very different considerations might apply. In those circumstances, SCTM might come under some duty to ensure that letters sent out by it on behalf of Ashdown were accurate, or reflected accurately what (to SCTM’s knowledge) had occurred. But this is not such a case.
	


Breach of duty in relation to Ms Kritikos’ search? 


	
	The next aspect of the cross-claim relates to what SCTM did when it made available to Ms Kritikos, for her inspection, the documents of Ashdown. Ms Kritikos is the sole director of a company known as Searches R Us Pty Ltd. She worked as a contractor to Eyeon. Eyeon retained Ms Kritikos’ company to search the records of Ashdown. There is no doubt that Ms Kritikos attended Ashdown’s premises at Willoughby on 21 June 2013, and that she there inspected records that were made available to her.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos gave evidence of her “usual procedure” when performing such an inspection (affidavit sworn 28 May 2014, paras 8 to 10):
	


8.   My usual procedure when performing a property record inspections (including company title inspections) is to:

(a)   look through the minute book for the past five years – this is because all changes have to be minuted and voted upon, and the strata company is obliged to maintain its records for at least five years;

(b)   look through the correspondence file – this is usually archived for three years, depending on the title manager and the size of the file;

(c)   check insurance documents, fire safety statements and other reports; and

(d)   look through any other documents available for inspection.

9.   If I find anything that is relevant, particularly if it is in relation to continuing matters involving the subject lot or unit or any records indicating that something is costing the strata or company ongoing money, I will make a note of it in my report. I will also make a note in my report of any records which I believe to be important and which appear to exist but which appear to be missing from the records.

10.   I will attach copies of important documents to the inspection report. For example, I will attach the minutes of at least the latest four meetings and at least up until the last annual general meeting. This is because the budget, levies and other major decisions are voted on by members or owners at annual general meetings.


	
	Ms Kritikos said that when she went to SCTM’s offices, she spoke to the receptionist and was directed to an area where she was given “hard-copy documents relating to the Ashdown building in general”. She did not recall being provided with a file specially relating to unit 20. That is not surprising, since SCTM did not maintain files for individual units in complexes under its management.
	
	
	For the purpose of swearing her affidavit, Ms Kritikos was provided with a number of documents. Of present relevance, the documents shown to her included the s 96 application and the letter of 24 April 2009. As to the first document, Ms Kritikos said that she did not recall seeing it, but that her usual practice was to take note of “DAs” (development applications).
	
	
	Ms Kritikos said that she was “quite certain” that the letter of 24 April 2009 was not among those shown to her when she inspected records on 21 June 2013. She said that she would have taken note of it because it related specifically to unit 20; it stated in essence that the air-conditioning might have to be removed; and it stated that the arrangements would be binding on successors on title. Ms Kritikos said, further, that as a matter of practice, had she seen that letter, she would have included it in her report.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos said, of various other documents that were shown to her for the purpose of swearing her affidavit, that it is likely that, had she seen them, they would have prompted her to carry out further investigations, even if they might not have been annexed to her report.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos said in para 34 of her affidavit:
	


I do not recall seeing any documents, including correspondence, board resolutions, board minutes, or reports relating to the installation of an air-conditioner for the Unit in 2009. In fact, I do not recall seeing a separate file for Unit 20 at all.


	
	SCTM called four witnesses. The first was Ms Wood. She was the founder and principal of SCTM until 3 December 2012. On that date, she sold two businesses, including SCTM, to a company known as Prudential Investment Company of Australia Pty Ltd (PICA). Ms Wood worked as a consultant to PICA for six months after the sale, until 14 May 2013.
	
	
	Up until 14 May 2013, SCTM had carried on its business from offices at Rockdale. On 14 May 2013, it moved to the Willoughby premises.
	
	
	Ms Wood gave evidence of system. She said that she instructed her staff to maintain the filing system that she instituted. That system included the following features:
	



	
	all records for one company (such as Ashdown) were kept and stored together under that company’s name.
	
	
	She did not keep a separate folder for each unit in a company title building.
	
	
	Documents were stored in coloured folders, according to the nature of the document. Correspondence was kept in green folders, minutes of meetings were kept in buff folders, and “documents” were kept in blue folders.
	
	
	What Ms Wood called “documents” included “documents that were ongoing such that we might need to look at them in the future… plans, signed agreements, articles of association, House Rules, survey reports and anything that was a legal document”.
	
	
	Within the blue documents folder, relevant documents were grouped together and placed in a clear plastic sleeve.
	
	
	When a folder became full, a new folder was started, maintaining the colour coding system.
	
	
	Older correspondence (green) folders were stored in boxes.
	
	
	All emails were printed out and placed in the correspondence folder; correspondence was filed in that folder in the order it was received.
	
	
	Documents were not retained in filing trays; staff were instructed to file them promptly and appropriately in the relevant folder in the order it was received.
	



	
	I accept Ms Woods’ evidence generally. Specifically, I accept her evidence of system and that she sought to ensure that her staff followed that system.
	
	
	Ms Wood said that SCTM took over the management of Ashdown from a company known as Fay McDonald & Associates (FMA) on 29 June 2009. When that happened, FMA handed over the records of Ashdown that were in their possession. Shortly after the handover, Ms Wood said, and I accept, that she refiled the records according to the system that I have described.
	
	
	Ms Wood was provided with the documents that had been shown to Ms Kritikos for the purpose of swearing her affidavit. She said that she had no recollection of seeing any of them (and this is hardly surprising). However, she said, had those documents been among the ones she received from FMA, she would have filed them according to her system.
	
	
	Ms Wood was given a plastic sleeve holding documents. I am satisfied that the plastic sleeve was taken from Ashdown’s records maintained by SCTM: specifically, from the blue documents folder. The plastic sleeve had “U20” written in the top right hand corner. Ms Wood identified that as her handwriting.
	
	
	The first document in the plastic sleeve was a printout of an email from Ms Roylance (then a director of Ashdown) to Ms Wood. The email referred to documents that Ms Roylance had given to Mr Lloyd of SCTM (who, at that time, had responsibility within SCTM for managing Ashdown’s affairs). The email asked Ms Wood to forward a copy of what Ms Roylance described as “the original of an agreement signed by Virginia Buckworth and Louise Daley regarding the addition of a timber structure on the penthouse terrace”, with the attached “copy of the DA variation”.
	
	
	Ms Wood wrote on the printout of the email:
	


Please copy documents and give to MB


	
	“MB” was a reference to Ms Wood, who for business purposes used her former name Muriel Barrass.
	
	
	Ms Wood gave evidence, which I accept, that, based on her usual practice, it is likely that she received the email, and arranged for the documents to be copied and sent to Ms Roylance. She then said that “following which, in accordance with my usual practice, I would have filed the plastic sleeve of [documents] in Ashdown’s “documents file”.
	
	
	SCTM produced the original files and they were tendered. It was not suggested that they had been disturbed, or otherwise molested, before they were produced. The documents to which Ms Wood referred (the documents in the plastic sleeve) were located between a letter dated 22 October 2013 (which was below the relevant sleeve) and a certificate issued on 23 May 2014 (which was above the relevant sleeve). The explanation for that is I think to be found in the evidence of Mr Greene.
	
	
	On the topic of records and their inspection, Mr Greene’s evidence was as follows. First, he substantially confirmed Ms Wood’s evidence as to the way in which documents were filed and kept. I might add that this evidence was confirmed by the other witnesses called for SCTM, Ms Cruz and Mr Lloyd, neither of whom was required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Greene said that on 18 September 2013, he received an email from Mr Bell asking for confirmation that the letter of 24 April 2009 was filed among Ashdown’s records. Mr Greene said that he searched through what he called the “Boxed Records” – that is to say, older records which had effectively been “archived” and stored in cardboard boxes. Those boxes, he said, were kept close to SCTM’s reception desk. Mr Greene found a copy of the 24 April 2009 letter in those records.
	
	
	On 8 November 2013, another member of Ashdown’s Board, Mr Peter Barakate, inquired if the 24 April 2009 was, as Mr Greene put it, “on SCTM’s files which are available for inspection by searchers”.
	
	
	Mr Greene then spoke to Ms Cruz. He ascertained that the records provided to searchers were the current records: namely, the coloured folders to which I have referred. Mr Greene then reviewed all those records. He found the 24 April 2009 letter in the “U20” sleeve in the blue folder, together with the print-out of the email from Ms Roylance to Ms Wood and the s 96 application.
	
	
	Mr Greene’s evidence suggested that the blue folder was not maintained chronologically, and that it was from time to time taken apart and refiled. He gave the following evidence (T189.45-191.8):
	


Q.     Ordinarily that blue folder is maintained chronologically, in the sense that material is added‑‑

A.    I wouldn't say chronologically ‑ that's not true.  Because these files are available to anybody; any inspector; any week, month or year; and they obviously don't put things back where they belong.  So, they're not in any great order.

Q.    But putting aside any change in order by a search agent, ordinarily those documents would appear in the order in which they are placed on the file, correct?

A.    No.

LUCARELLI: Could I approach, your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

LUCARELLI

Q.    The plastic sleeve with the asterisk appears after correspondence dated October 2013. Do you see that?

A.    Yes, I see that. The point I'm trying to make is a lot of people over a period of time pull these files apart. From there they take out the files they want - whether it's for copying, faxing or whatever - and put them back, not in necessarily the same order, so - I've seen plenty of people do that: inspectors, company title searchers.

Q.    Perhaps even your staff?

A.    True.

Q.    The location of that plastic sleeve, being after unrelated correspondence of October 2013, suggests to you, doesn't it, that at some time after October 2013 - wherever it was on that file - it's been put back?

A.    Correct.

Q.    In its current location?

A.    In the file somewhere - correct.

Q.    That is, assuming it was in the file before October 2013?

A.    Sure.

Q.    You can't give this Court any direct evidence, can you, at all as to whether that sleeve was on that file prior to November 2013; correct?

A.    Correct.

HIS HONOUR

Q.    May I just ask you this, Mr Green, as a matter of practice among SCTMs employees at least, if a document is removed from a file for inspection or copying, or whatever, is it normally after that is completed placed back in the same file?

A.    Yes, correct. I'm sorry, sir, this is the same file?

Q.    The blue folder, yes, the documents folder, as I think it's being called?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Has that been the position for as long as you've been at SCTM?

A.    At that stage, I was only there for about four months. I started in June,

June, correct.

Q.     As a matter of practice, documents that are removed from a particular file or folder are normally returned to that file or folder?

A.     That's correct.

Q.     Once the particular purpose for which they're removed has been satisfied?

A.     Correct, yes


	
	Ms Cruz gave affidavit evidence that, once the SCTM business was sold to PICA, she worked solely for SCTM in what she called “client support”. Her duties included booking inspections of records, preparation of the records for inspection, and general administrative support. In addition, she was SCTM’s receptionist after the sale to PICA.
	
	
	Ms Cruz said that the system for filing company title records that Ms Wood had instituted was maintained after the move to Willoughby, and has been maintained up to the present time.
	
	
	Ms Cruz gave evidence of her usual practice at inspections. That practice included the following matters:
	



	
	she would take the current records for the building from the place where they were stored and placed them on a desk that was allocated for the inspection;
	
	
	she would print out certain financial and other records and place them with the documents for inspection;
	
	
	when the searcher arrived, Ms Cruz would take the searcher to the place where the documents were located and leave him or her there to do the work;
	
	
	after about 15 minutes, Ms Cruz would inquire of the searcher whether he or she required any further information.
	



	
	Ms Cruz said that most searchers completed the task within two hours.
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the basis of Ms Cruz’s evidence, that the current records for Ashdown, including the coloured folders to which I have referred, were made available to Ms Kritikos for inspection on 21 June 2013.
	
	
	Mr Lloyd, a former employee of SCTM, gave evidence by affidavit. He was from mid-2009 until early December 2012 the person within SCTM who had responsibility for managing Ashdown’s affairs. He confirmed Ms Wood’s evidence of system.
	
	
	Mr Lloyd from time to time attended meetings of Ashdown’s Board. He recalled attending a Board meeting in early December 2012. His diary confirmed the date as 6 December (and Ms Roylance agrees that he attended a meeting on that date). It was at that meeting that Ms Roylance said she handed over documents including the 24 April 2009 letter and the s 96 application. Although Mr Lloyd had no recollection of being given those documents, he said that if he were given them, he would have placed them in the current green correspondence folder, which it was his practice to take to meetings.
	
	
	A green correspondence folder for Ashdown was tendered. It included a copy of the letter of 24 April 2009 together with the s 96 application. Those documents appear between a letter dated 11 December 2012 (immediately before the 24 April 2009 letter) and a letter of 16 January 2013 (immediately after it). Bearing in mind Ms Wood’s evidence of system – specifically, that correspondence folders were maintained chronologically – I find that the particular copy of the letter of 24 April 2009 (with the s 96 application) was placed in the correspondence folder between those two dates. I say that because I accept that the particular copy of the letter (with the s 96 application) was given to Mr Lloyd on 6 December 2013.
	
	
	It was not suggested to any of SCTM’s witnesses that the correspondence folder had been dismembered or molested, or that the copy of the letter of 24 April 2009 had been placed there at some later date.
	
	
	The evidence of SCTM’s present and former employees (including Ms Wood within that category) suggests very strongly that copies of the letter of 24 April 2009 and s 96 application were located within the records of SCTM in three locations when Ms Kritikos carried out her inspection on 21 June 2013. Specifically:
	



	
	one copy was located within the blue documents folder;
	
	
	another copy was located within the green correspondence file; and
	
	
	another copy was located within a box containing older, or archived, correspondence.
	



	
	There is no dispute, and I find, that the blue and green folders were made available to Ms Kritikos for her inspection. Equally, there is no dispute, and I find, that the archive boxes were not made available, although they would have been made available had Ms Kritikos asked for them.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos was shown a number of folders, including a blue folder relating to insurance (which is of no present relevance), and also the blue documents folder in which, at the present time at least, there is the “U20” sleeve and the documents to which I have referred within it. Of that folder, Ms Kritikos gave the following evidence (T35.19-36.14):
	


Q.    Can I show the witness another folder of blue headed documents. Again, excluding any documents that postdate 21 June 2013, can you indicate whether this is a folder of documents that you saw during your inspection on 21 June 2013?

A.    I can't recall.

Q.    So is it possible that this folder was amongst the records that you reviewed on 21 June 2013?

A.    I don't recall sighting it.

Q.    Are you certain that you didn't sight it, or do you just not have a recollection one way or the other?

A.    I don't have a recollection.

Q.    So you cannot exclude the possibility that this was one of the folders that you inspected on 21 June 2013?

A.    Yeah, no.

Q.    My question was‑‑

A.    Sorry.

Q.    That's okay. My question was that you cannot exclude the possibility that this was one of the folders that you inspected on 21 June 2013, can you?

A.    I can't absolutely discredit it, no.

Q.    Can I ask you to have a look at the seventh plastic sleeve from the front, I think it is the seventh plastic sleeve, so long as my maths is right?

A.    Mmm.

Q.    That's the plastic sleeve with the ""U20"" written on the plastic sleeve, isn't it?

A.    Yes.

Q.    That is the one that Mr Izzo asked you about, I won't repeat his questions, I promise. Your evidence is that you can't positively exclude the possibility that that folder was amongst the folders that you inspected on 21 June 2013, that's correct isn't it?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Is it also true to say that you cannot positively exclude the possibility that that plastic sleeve with that material was amongst that folder on 21 June?

A.    Correct, but again if I did sight it I would have taken more note of it being noted as Unit 20.

Q.    In accordance with your usual practice?

A.    Yes.


	
	At this point, I note that although Ms Kritikos could not recall seeing or “sighting” this folder – seemingly, she had no recollection one way or another – I find, on the basis of the substantially unchallenged evidence for SCTM to which I have referred, that it was among the records made available for her inspection on 21 June 2013.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos was then shown the green correspondence folder. She could not recollect if it was one of the folders that she looked at (T36.45), although she did inspect correspondence included in a folder which contained plastic sleeves (T36.47-.37.5). I find that she was given the green correspondence folder to inspect.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos gave the following evidence in relation to the correspondence folder (T37.7-.19):
	


Q.    Can I ask you to turn, when you are ready, I am not trying to rush you, there is an orange divider almost at the back. If you go to that and then go seven plastic sleeves forward. Go seven forward from there. I think you will see the letter of 24 April 2009?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Do you accept that it is possible that (a) you did see that folder on 21 June 2013?

A.    It is possible.

Q.    And it is possible that when you inspected it on 21 June 2013 that the letter of 24 April was in the plastic sleeve there, isn't it?

A.    Possible, but I can't guarantee, I can't be certain.


	
	More generally, Ms Kritikos accepted that she had no clear recollection of the inspection (and that is hardly surprising) (T22.35-23.3). It is not necessary to set that evidence out.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos was also shown the buff minutes folder. Ms Kritikos agreed that it was possible that this was the file of minutes that she saw on 21 June 2013; it looked like it (T34.1-.10):
	


Q.    Ignoring anything post 21 July 2013, can you have a look at that file and indicate whether that is the file of minutes that you saw on 21 June 2013?

A.    It is possible, yes.

Q.    You certainly can't exclude the possibility that that is the folder of minutes that you saw on 21 July 2013?

A.    It looks like it.

Q.    Most likely?

A.    Yes.


	
	Ms Kritikos said, and affirmed in cross-examination, that her usual procedure was to look at a company’s minute books for the previous five years. However, she said, she did not read every line of every minute, paying more attention to the more recent minutes (T24.28-.44).
	
	
	Ms Cruz said, and I find, that the documents made available for Ms Kritikos to inspect included the buff minutes folder. Ms Kritikos said that if (as seemed to have been the case) the folder of minutes she was first shown only went back to 2011, she would have asked for earlier minutes (T26.11-.21). I have no doubt that other, older, folders of minutes would have been given to her in answer to that request.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos was then shown a copy of the minutes of 31 March 2009. She accepted that she had “no particular recollection” of seeing that document on 21 June 2013.
	
	
	That is of some significance, because those minutes were not among the records shown to Ms Kritikos for the purpose of swearing her affidavit, in respect of which she gave the evidence that I have summarised at [304] to [307] above. Thus, there was no evidence in chief from Ms Kritikos that those minutes were not among the records shown to her.
	
	
	Although the minutes folder that was tendered only went back to 2011, Ms Kritikos’ evidence is that she would have asked for the earlier folder. Having regard to the evidence of system, I find that the earlier folder (that is to say, the folder which included minutes around the period 31 March 2009) would have included the minutes of 31 March 2009. Thus, I find, the records made available to Ms Kritikos for inspection did include those minutes.
	
	
	Ms Kritikos agreed that those (31 March 2009) minutes were not referred to in the report that she furnished. She accepted that this could be for a number of reasons (T29.5-.33):
	


Q.    I think you will agree with me that these minutes aren't mentioned in your report?

A.    Correct.

Q.    That could be for a number of reasons, can I suggest to you. First, it might be that you just didn't read these minutes particularly closely, is that a possibility?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Or, that you didn't read minutes going as far back as 2009, is that another possibility?

A.    Board meeting minutes?

Q.    Yes, board meeting minutes?

A.    No, possibly, yes.

Q.    You would agree with me that ultimately whether you end up noting in your report something that comes out of the board meeting minutes of Ashdown is going to depend on you first of all reading a particular minute closely enough to appreciate that a matter in it might be significant, you would agree?

A.    Yes.

Q.    That would have to happen if you are going to pick it up?

A.    Correct.

Q.    If there are particular minutes you didn't read very closely which spoke about approvals for Unit 20, then you wouldn't end up being in a position to note those things in your report?

A.    Yes.


	
	Considering the evidence on this point in its totality, and taking into account the concessions that Ms Kritikos made in cross-examination, I am satisfied, and find, that the letter of 24 April 2009 and the accompanying s 96 application were among the documents provided to Ms Kritikos for inspection on 21 June 2013. I find that there was a copy located in the blue documents folder and another copy located in the green correspondence folder. I find that both those folders were made available to Ms Kritikos for inspection on 21 June 2013.
	
	
	I find, further, that the documents made available to Ms Kritikos for inspection on 21 June 2013 included the minutes of the directors’ meeting held on 31 March 2009.
	
	
	It is possible that Ms Kritikos overlooked the significance of the letter of 24 April 2009. It is possible that she did not read it carefully in the correspondence folder, because of its date (and there are passages in her cross-examination that suggest that she paid more attention to recent rather than older documents). It is equally possible that she paid no attention to it in the blue “documents” folder because it was behind the print-out of the email from Ms Roylance to Ms Wood of 3 January 2013.
	
	
	In the ordinary way, one would think that a sleeve marked “U20” would have attracted Ms Kritikos’ attention. However, for whatever reason, she appears to have overlooked it.
	
	
	For those reasons I find that SCTM did not breach whatever duty it owed to Ashdown to make current records available for inspection on request.
	


Proportionate liability


	
	As I have said, Ashdown raised a “proportionate liability” defence. Mr Izzo and Ms Horvath put competing submissions as to the way in which any liability on their respective clients should be carved up. Those submissions were recorded and transcribed.
	
	
	The conclusions to which I have come make it unnecessary to express a conclusion on those submissions. Nor is there any point in doing so, since of necessity that would be an exercise based on entirely hypothetical circumstances.
	


Reasons for ruling: the letters of 16 and 19 September 2013


	
	Mr Izzo objected to the tender of each of those letters. He did so because each was headed “without prejudice”, invoking s 131 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	For convenience, I set out s 131:
	


EVIDENCE ACT 1995 - SECT 131 

Exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations

(1)   Evidence is not to be adduced of:

(a)   a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute; or

(b)    a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute.

(2)    Subsection (1) does not apply if:

(a)    the persons in dispute consent to the evidence being adduced in the proceeding concerned or, if any of those persons has tendered the communication or document in evidence in another Australian or overseas proceeding, all the other persons so consent; or

(b)    the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of all the persons in dispute; or

(c)    the substance of the evidence has been partly disclosed with the express or implied consent of the persons in dispute, and full disclosure of the evidence is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the other evidence that has already been adduced; or

(d)    the communication or document included a statement to the effect that it was not to be treated as confidential; or

(e)    the evidence tends to contradict or to qualify evidence that has already been admitted about the course of an attempt to settle the dispute; or

(f)    the proceeding in which it is sought to adduce the evidence is a proceeding to enforce an agreement between the persons in dispute to settle the dispute, or a proceeding in which the making of such an agreement is in issue; or

(g)    evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, or an inference from evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, is likely to mislead the court unless evidence of the communication or document is adduced to contradict or to qualify that evidence; or

(h)    the communication or document is relevant to determining liability for costs; or

(i)    making the communication, or preparing the document, affects a right of a person; or

(j)    the communication was made, or the document was prepared, in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or an offence or the commission of an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty; or

(k)    one of the persons in dispute, or an employee or agent of such a person, knew or ought reasonably to have known that the communication was made, or the document was prepared, in furtherance of a deliberate abuse of a power.

(3)    For the purposes of paragraph (2)(j), if commission of the fraud, offence or act is a fact in issue and there are reasonable grounds for finding that:

(a)    the fraud, offence or act was committed; and

(b)    a communication was made or a document was prepared in furtherance of the commission of the fraud, offence or act;

the court may find that the communication was so made or the document so prepared.

(4)    For the purposes of paragraph (2)(k), if:

(a)    the abuse of power is a fact in issue; and

(b)    there are reasonable grounds for finding that a communication was made or a document was prepared in furtherance of the abuse of power;

the court may find that the communication was so made or the document was so prepared.

(5)    In this section:

(a)    a reference to a dispute is a reference to a dispute of a kind in respect of which relief may be given in an Australian or overseas proceeding; and

(b)    a reference to an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a dispute does not include a reference to an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a criminal proceeding or an anticipated criminal proceeding; and

(c)    a reference to a communication made by a person in dispute includes a reference to a communication made by an employee or agent of such a person; and

(d)    a reference to the consent of a person in dispute includes a reference to the consent of an employee or agent of such a person, being an employee or agent who is authorised so to consent; and

(e)    a reference to commission of an act includes a reference to a failure to act.

(6)    In this section:

""power"" means a power conferred by or under an Australian law.


	
	The letters must be placed in context. There was a raging dispute between Gladio and Ms Buckworth as to the former’s entitlement to rescind the contract for sale for non-disclosure, and (conversely) the latter’s right to insist on completion. That debate arose from the very belated disclosure of the letter of 24 April 2009, and the subsequent change in the House Rules, apparently, as to Rule 22, pursuant to the last paragraph of that letter.
	
	
	Whilst Day Legal was waging a correspondence battle with Hunt & Hunt over this dispute, Mr Robbiati was pursuing directors of Ashdown in an attempt to find a solution. He had a conversation with Mr Bell on 9 September 2013, in which (among other things) House Rule 22 was discussed. The next day, 10 September 2013, SCTM sent Mr Robbiati a letter drafted by Mr Bell. That letter, among other things, noted that the directors were reviewing the Rule and solicited Mr Robbiati’s “views on the possibility of passing a rule which simply gives direct effect to the letter”.
	
	
	The first letter to which Mr Izzo objected – the letter of 16 September 2013 – was written in reply to SCTM’s letter of 10 September 2013. In the letter, Mr Robbiati gave what in his view was the “brief background of the purchase transaction currently in flight [sic] for unit 20”, and replied “to the assertions contained in your letter in relation to my conversation with Mr Austin Bell of 9 September 2013”.
	
	
	The letter of 16 September 2013 was plainly headed “WITHOUT PREJUDICE”. After the introductory paragraph that I have summarised, it dealt, in four numbered sections, with some four topics. The first section after that paragraph set out Mr Robbiati’s view of the “background”. The second section set out his account of the conversation with Mr Bell. Looking at the matter in terms of s 131, nothing up to and including the second (numbered) section of the letter could be regarded as “a communication… in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of [a] dispute”.
	
	
	The third section of the letter set out what (in Mr Robbiati’s view) were “the issues at hand”. There were three such issues: the process to be followed for Ashdown’s rules to be changed; “proper disclosure standards”; and “rule 22”.
	
	
	The fourth section of the letter set out Mr Robbiati’s view as to a “proposed way forward”.
	
	
	I do accept that, read together and in context, the third and fourth sections of the letter should be taken as articulating (in Mr Robbiati’s view at least) the issues on which he and Ashdown were “in dispute” for the purposes of s 131(1)(a) of the Evidence Act and a proposal “to negotiate a settlement of [that] dispute”. Thus, in my view, the third and fourth numbered sections of the letter should be excluded from the tender, under s 131(1)(a).
	
	
	Implicit in that view is the proposition that the statutory proscription is capable of application to part only of a document such as a letter. That is to say, it is implicit in the view that I have set out that the “communication” may be part only of a document. I raised that with Mr Izzo in the course of argument. He accepted that it was correct.
	
	
	Thus, in my view, where part of a letter dealing with several topics is a “communication” of the kind referred to in s 131(1)(a), the statutory proscription applies only to so much of the letter as is, or constitutes, that “communication”. There may be an exception, if the rest of the letter is so closely intertwined with the proscribed “communication” that it cannot be sensibly be separated out. However, that does not arise in the present case. As I have said, the letter contains an introductory paragraph, and then has some four discrete numbered sections.
	
	
	Accordingly, I ruled that the third and fourth numbered sections of the letter should be excluded, but that the balance should be admitted.
	
	
	SCTM’s letter of 19 September 2013 was written in reply to Mr Robbiati’s letter of 16 September 2013 (that is not expressly stated, but it was common ground that the later letter did reply to the earlier). Again, the letter of 19 September 2013 was clearly headed “WITHOUT PREJUDICE”.
	
	
	The first two sentences of the letter read as follows:
	


We are instructed by the directors to respond to your letter as follows.

The directors do not propose to respond to each of the matters you raise in detail.


	
	Nothing in the letter responded to, or commented on, the third and fourth sections of the letter of 16 September 2013. Nothing in the letter contained any communication proposing, or seeking to negotiate, a resolution of the issues that then existed between Mr Robbiati (or Gladio) and Ashdown. Although the letter was headed “WITHOUT PREJUDICE”, that was presumably because it was a reply to a letter similarly headed. In truth, there is nothing in the letter of 19 September 2013 that could conceivably fall within s 131(1)(a) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The letter of 19 September 2013 was admitted into evidence accordingly.
	
	
	Mr Izzo submitted later that, if the letters were to be admitted, he would prefer that the whole of the earlier letter be admitted. Accordingly, and accepting that he took this position based on the ruling I had given, the previously rejected portions of that letter – sections 3 and 4 – were also admitted into evidence.
	


Reasons for ruling: application for leave to withdraw admission


	
	The admission, leave to withdraw which was sought, was made in respect of [76] of the Amended Statement of Claim (ASC) (the version preceding FASOC). To give some context to the debate, and to enable Ms Buckworth’s cross-examination on this topic to be understood, I set out the first three paragraphs of “Chapter V” of the ASC, which was headed “Rescission for misrepresentation”:
	


75.   At all material times prior to 16 July 2013 Ms Buckworth knew that Ashdown’s consent for her to use the roof area above Unit 20 to install the requisite air-conditioning equipment to enable Unit 20 to be air-conditioned was on the terms set out in 24 April 2009 letter.

76.   At all material times prior to 16 July 2013 Ms Buckworth had in her possession, custody or control a copy of the 24 April 2009 Letter.

77.   At all material times prior to 16 July 2013 Ms Buckworth knew or ought to have known the 24 April 2009 Letter was highly material to any prospect purchaser of Unit 20.


	
	Chapter V continued for a further 17 paragraphs, but it is not necessary to set them out.
	
	
	By her amended defence (filed in answer to the ASC) Ms Buckworth:
	



	
	said nothing – remained silent – as to [75], [76]; and
	
	
	said that she “does not admit paragraph 77 of the amended statement of claim”.
	



	
	It is clear, comparing the ASC and the defence to it, that the drafting technique employed was such that, where an allegation of fact was admitted, nothing was said as to that allegation of fact. In those circumstances, there was a deemed admission of that material fact (UCPR r 14.26(1)). By way of example only of this deliberate drafting technique, the ASC alleged at [74] that “Ms Buckworth has failed to refund to Gladio the Deposit”. Plainly, that was correct. The Amended Defence was silent as to that paragraph. Plainly, the drafter of the defence intended that the deemed admission for which the Rules provide would be sufficient. The same may be said of numerous other allegations of material fact which were plainly correct, and hence (as I see it) were not traversed in the defence.
	
	
	This analysis of the pleading technique is confirmed by an exchange of correspondence between Minter Ellison (acting for Gladio) and Hunt & Hunt (acting for Ms Buckworth) in May 2014. Minter Ellison wrote on 15 May 2014, stating among other things:
	


We note the Amended Defence does not plead to a number of paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Claim that are pleaded against your client. … by not pleading to those paragraphs…, your client is taken to have admitted them. We will be proceeding to trial on that basis.


	
	Hunt & Hunt’s reply of 19 May 2014 said, as to this paragraph, that:
	


You may take it that we are aware of the relevant rules.


	
	I infer both from the structure of the pleadings and from that exchange of correspondence that the decision not to plead to ASC [76] was deliberate.
	
	
	Ms Buckworth agreed in cross-examination that she had read the ASC although, she said, not carefully (T83.26-.31). She understood that it included a complaint about non-disclosure of the letter of 24 April 2009 (T83.49-84.11). She knew that she needed to respond by way of defence (T84.25-.27).
	
	
	Ms Buckworth was asked whether her solicitors specifically asked her about her possession of the 24 April 2009 letter, for the purpose of drafting her defence. She denied that. However, upon being shown a document, she did not stand by that evidence, and accepted that she had been asked about her possession of the letter (T84.29-85.22). Her evidence on this was a little bit confused but it ended in the following question and answer (T85.45-.47):
	


Q.     Did your solicitor ask you the question, namely, did you have a copy of the 24 April 2009 letter for the purposes of preparing your defence, yes or no?

A.     Yes.


	
	The “solicitor” concerned did not give evidence. The obvious inference is that the instructions to him or her, in answer to the question asked of Ms Buckworth, were consistent with the non-traverse of ASC [76].
	
	
	It might be noted that “Mr Grieve was closely involved with the drafting of [Ms Buckworth’s] defence” (T85.50-86.1). However, Mr Grieve did not give evidence as to the reasons why there was no traverse of ASC [76].
	
	
	I should make it perfectly clear that I am not in any way critical of the decision, apparently taken deliberately, to “admit” non-contentious pleadings of material fact by the technique of not traversing them. On the contrary, the use of that technique spares the reader the task of ploughing through numerous paragraphs stating, in effect, “the defendant admits paragraph XXX of the amended statement of claim”. It enables the reader’s attention to be focused on those allegations of material fact that are either “not admitted”, or are denied; and on the additional substantive matters pleaded in answer to some of them.
	
	
	On the evidence as I have summarised it, there is simply no explanation for the decision to “admit”, by not traversing, ASC [76]. The failure to explain what is now said to be a mistake is compounded because Ms Buckworth accepts that she was asked whether she had a copy of the letter in her possession, but did not say (either in her affidavit or in her oral evidence) that she told the solicitor she did not have a copy of the letter in her possession.
	
	
	I should however note that Mr Grieve sought to re-examine on this topic. He asked (T93.7-.10):
	


Q.     You were shown a document which has been marked 8 for identification and you were then asked a question to the effect did your solicitor ask you whether you had a copy of the letter of 24 April 2009 to which you responded in the affirmative.  I ask you what was your answer to the solicitor's question?


	
	Mr Lucarelli objected, on the basis that the re-examination did not arise from the cross-examination. The objection was in my view well-taken. Accordingly, I rejected the question.
	
	
	The obvious inference, as the evidence stands, is that the answer that Ms Buckworth gave to the solicitor justified his or her decision not to traverse ASC [76]. In drawing that inference (as I do) I take into account that the solicitor has not been called to say that he or she was given an answer inconsistent with the non-traverse of that paragraph, and no explanation has been given for the failure to call that solicitor.
	
	
	The significance of those matters is reinforced by the correspondence to which I have referred. Minter Ellison told Hunt & Hunt plainly and clearly that Gladio was going to trial on the basis of, among other things, the admissions on the pleadings.
	
	
	Ms Buckworth said in her affidavit (in support of her notice of motion) that she was not aware of the significance of the deemed admission until Mr Lucarelli opened the case for the plaintiff. This aspect of her evidence was not attacked directly in cross-examination. However, that affidavit was read on the notice of motion. It was not admitted as evidence on the hearing; nor was the cross-examination on it.
	
	
	In any event, that evidence (if it could be taken into account) would not assist Ms Buckworth. She agreed that she had been given a copy of Minter Ellison’s letter of 15 May 2014 at or about the time it was written, and had read it carefully. Likewise, she agreed that (probably) she would have received a copy of Hunt & Hunt’s reply of 19 May 2014 at or about the time it was written, and would have read and understood it (T89.32-91.14).
	
	
	There is another relevant factor. Ms Buckworth affirmed an affidavit on 11 May 2014 which set out her evidence in support of her amended defence, and referred specifically to the ASC.
	
	
	In para 3 of that affidavit, under the heading “Air-conditioning”, Ms Buckworth set out the circumstances in which the letter of 24 April 2009 had been drafted. She did not say, in that paragraph or elsewhere in the affidavit, that she did not have a copy of the letter.
	
	
	Paragraph 4 of the affidavit dealt with the use (or non-use) of the air-conditioning. Paragraphs 5 and following turned to the ASC. In para 5, Ms Buckworth referred to ASC [77] and said that up until 16 July 2013 she “did not know or consider that the 24 April 2009 letter was “highly material to any prospective purchaser of unit 20”…” for reasons which she said had already been set out.
	
	
	She gave the following evidence (T88.12-.37):
	


Q.   Please read paragraph 77 of the amended statement of claim and tell me when you have done so?

A.     I've read it.

Q.     You respond to that paragraph 77, do you not, in paragraph 5 of your affidavit of 11 May 2014, correct?

A.     Correct.

Q.     You respond to paragraph 77 by telling the Court that you did not consider the 24 April 2009 letter as highly material, correct?

A.     Correct.

Q.     It is the case, isn't it, that when you read paragraph 77 of the amended statement of claim you also read paragraph 76 of the amended statement of claim?

A.     Yes and there's an explanation for that.

Q.     The answer is yes, you read paragraph 76 of the amended statement of claim prior to swearing your affidavit of 11 May 2014, correct?

A.     Correct.


	
	Having observed Ms Buckworth in the witness box, and having taken note of her insistence on answering – not always responsively – propositions that she thought were not correct, I have to say that I find it unlikely in the extreme that, having read ASC [76], she would not have mentioned it in her affidavit had she thought that what it said was incorrect. Again, she gave no evidence of having given instructions to the solicitor who assisted in the drafting of her affidavit (or to Mr Grieve, who apparently settled it) in relation to ASC [76]. Again, neither the solicitor nor Mr Grieve gave evidence on this issue.
	
	
	The evidence does not support the proposition that the failure to traverse ASC [76] arose from a mistake on the part of the solicitor to whom Ms Buckworth gave instructions, or on the part of Mr Grieve who settled the amended statement of defence. The cumulative failures to deal with the material fact alleged in ASC [76] – first in the amended statement of defence, and next in the affidavit affirmed on 11 May 2014 – coupled with Ms Buckworth’s insistence on rigour and accuracy (as I perceived it in the witness box), make it very difficult to accept that the failure to traverse ASC [76] was the result of oversight or mistake.
	
	
	In circumstances where Ms Buckworth’s solicitors were specifically warned, and where she understood, that Gladio was preparing for trial among other things on the basis of the admissions deemed to have been made, the want of any explanation whatsoever for the failure to traverse ASC [76] was, in my view, fatal to the application for leave to withdraw the admission.
	
	
	I should add that even if Ms Buckworth had been permitted to answer the question referred to at [385] above, and had said in substance that she told the solicitor that she did not have a copy of the letter, my view would be no different. That would still leave totally unexplained the cumulative failures to traverse ASC [76], and to include in her affidavit of 11 May 2014 (or in any subsequent affidavit prior to the one sworn in support of the application for leave to withdraw the admission) what Ms Buckworth now says was the correct state of affairs – namely, that she did not have a copy of the letter of 24 April 2009 in her possession at any material time.
	
	
	Further, bearing in mind the time at which and the circumstances in which the application was made, and the possible consequences for the hearing if leave to withdraw the admission were given, and taking into account the amount at stake, it seemed to me (as it still does) that, analysed in terms of s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act, 2005 (",2015-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Kevin Glen Jones, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by McLoughlin DCJ at Taree District Court on 28 February 2014.
	
	
	The Applicant had pleaded guilty to one count of attempted aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to ss.113(2) and 344A Crimes Act 1900. This offence is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years with no standard non-parole period. 
	
	
	The Applicant asked the sentencing Judge to take two further offences into account on a Form 1, both punishable by imprisonment for five years with no standard non-parole period:
	



	
	being carried in a conveyance knowing that it had been taken without consent, contrary to s.154A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900; and
	
	
	intentionally damaging property, contrary to s.195(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	Taking into account the Form 1 offences, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and four months commencing on 29 August 2013 and expiring on 28 December 2016, with a balance of term of one year and two months expiring on 28 February 2018.
	


Factual Background


	
	There was no dispute between the parties in the District Court, nor in this Court, as to the facts of the offending.
	
	
	At about 12.30 am on 6 June 2010, CCTV footage recorded at Coles Shopping Centre on Major Innes Drive, Port Macquarie showed two males in a white Toyota Prado bearing Queensland registration plates. This vehicle had been stolen on 28 May 2010, from Currumbin in Queensland.
	
	
	The Prado was parked in the car park at the Centre while the Applicant, dressed in a white hooded jumper, exited the driver’s side front door and approached on foot the Liquorland Store at that location. The Applicant was wearing white socks on his hands and looked through the glass windows into the store.
	
	
	The CCTV footage showed the Applicant’s co-offender, Jason Rousell (“Rousell”) exiting the passenger side front door briefly before getting back into the vehicle. He was wearing dark coloured jeans and a dark grey hooded jumper and was carrying a torch. The surveillance footage showed the Applicant returning to the vehicle where he sat in the driver’s seat while Rousell sat in the front passenger seat.
	
	
	The Applicant then reversed the vehicle between ram raid bollards and into the glass doors of the shop, thereby causing damage. The vehicle was not travelling fast enough to smash through the doors.
	
	
	A short time later, the Applicant was seen by police to punch the driver’s side window of a nearby “Radio Rentals” van. On investigation, the police found that a portion of the driver’s side window had been smashed. The Applicant then ran to the Prado which was parked in front of the van and entered the vehicle via the front passenger side door.
	
	
	Rousell was sitting in the driver’s seat of the Prado and drove off at high speed, with police in pursuit and all warning devices activated. The pursuit lasted for approximately seven minutes and covered nine kilometres. The vehicle only came to a stop after an attempted U-turn, where there was insufficient room to do so between the pursuing police vehicle and a highway guide rail.
	
	
	Rousell fled a short distance from the Prado, before being apprehended by police. The Applicant also fled but was not apprehended. The white hooded jumper worn by the Applicant was found by police in bushland nearby, along with a pair of socks. Analysis of fingerprints from the Prado and DNA obtained from the white hooded jumper were found to match the Applicant.
	
	
	A warrant was issued by Port Macquarie Local Court for the arrest of the Applicant in December 2011 in relation to the offending.
	
	
	At about 1.20 pm on 29 December 2012, the Applicant was seen driving a vehicle bearing Queensland registration plates along the Pacific Highway at Cooperabung. Being aware that the Applicant had a warrant for his arrest, police attempted to stop the vehicle. However, the Applicant took off at speed, managing to evade police.
	
	
	Approximately an hour and a half later, the Applicant was observed in the same vehicle. Police commenced to follow the vehicle for some distance, noting that at times the Applicant drove the vehicle on the incorrect side of the road and in a manner that was generally dangerous to other road users.
	
	
	The Applicant ultimately abandoned the vehicle in bushland and made good his escape.
	
	
	A short time later, the Applicant was arrested at an address in Kempsey. He was taken back to Kempsey Police Station and entered into custody.
	
	
	The offender participated in an ERISP at which time he admitted to being present and taking part in the offending on 6 June 2010, but that his recollection of the events was vague.
	


Sentence Imposed on Co-Offender


	
	Rousell, the Applicant’s co-offender, was sentenced in relation to this sequence of offending by McLoughlin DCJ at Port Macquarie District Court on 17 December 2010. Relevantly, he was sentenced for the offence of attempted aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and four months to commence on 6 September 2010 and expire on 5 January 2014, with a balance of term of 14 months to commence on 6 January 2014 and expire on 5 March 2015.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Applicant was born in November 1985. He was 24 years old at the time of the offence and 28 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant has an extensive criminal history, primarily involving property offences. That history spans across New South Wales, Tasmania, and Queensland.
	
	
	A presentence report, tendered at the sentencing proceedings, revealed that the Applicant had started consuming alcohol at 11 years of age and that his use became problematic at about 17 years of age. By age 13, the Applicant appears to have developed a dependence on cannabis. The Applicant reported that he had managed to control his alcohol consumption at age 18 and to cease his drug dependency between the ages of 22 and 24. However, he identified that in ceasing his drug use he simply reverted to heavy daily alcohol consumption instead. The Applicant admitted that both in the lead up to and at the time of the offences, he had been prone to daily alcohol consumption to the point of intoxication. He stated that he had been drinking heavily at the time of the offending and that he had little recall of the events that took place.
	


Some Aspects of the Sentencing Hearing and Remarks on Sentence


	
	Given the issues raised in this appeal, it is appropriate to set out some pertinent aspects of the sentencing hearing and his Honour’s remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant came before McLoughlin DCJ in the District Court for proceedings on sentence on 17 December 2013. A bundle of material, including a statement of facts, particulars of the Applicant’s criminal history, a transcript of the remarks on sentence, transcript and other material in relation to the Applicant’s co-offender, and a presentence report were tendered by the Crown at the hearing. The Applicant tendered two references; one from Phillip Butler, the Applicant’s former employer, and the other from Mark Trusk, the Applicant’s “Alcoholics Anonymous” sponsor.
	
	
	The substance of the Applicant’s submissions on sentence is revealed in the following exchange:
	


“OLIVER [Defence Counsel]: Your Honour has the parity point. The co-accused got four and a half years. He was about the same age. They've got records that are about comparable. They both pleaded guilty. The irony for Mr Jones is that of the three things that occurred that night, that is backing the car into Liquorland, the substantive offence, he was the driver sure but the-

HIS HONOUR: This is the car that was stolen in Queensland?

OLIVER: Yes but not by either men I don't think, certainly not by Mr Jones. In any event he reversed the car into Liquorland so he, in a way, was more culpable on the attempt break and enter. Of course nothing was stolen. The vehicle didn't get up enough speed to get through the doors. But probably in my respectful submission the most culpable thing that happened that evening was the course of reckless driving committed by the co-offender and it was Mr Jones who sat in the passenger seat so he is only permitted himself to be driven in a conveyance whereas it was the other man Raufel [sic] who drove in that manner for six kilometres. That is probably the only distinction that can be made in relation to the offending is that on the Form 1 offence, this man was much less culpable than the other man. He just sat in the car while the other man drove it in that manner. He did escape. So that is three and a half years ago now. Your Honour will see when you look more closely at the records that he has come to attention in other states in those three and a half years. He served some time in Tasmania for a burglary. He served some time in Queensland for an assault and he came to the notice of NSW Police on this offence on 29 December last year he was driving around the area in a fashion that came to attention of police, was pulled up for the driving, warrant issued for his arrest for this matter, he's been in custody since 29 December last year. Eight of those months were for the driving offences so it's really only 28 August as the Crown points out that any sentence would count from. Mr Jones by virtue of his moving between the states is in the very unfortunate position where he's got the parity argument today, there's not much that can be said about that. There's not much that can be said about special circumstances because on the day he's released to parole from this offence, he'll be extradited to Queensland to serve the balance of his parole. It's a parole argument in Queensland. He won't have representation. There'll be no-one up there - no lawyer up there to argue a totality argument for him. He'll just go himself before the Parole board in Queensland and in effect be deprived of the opportunity for both this matter and the Queensland assault to run together in any fashion or almost-

HIS HONOUR: That will be a matter for them. I have no jurisdiction.

OLIVER: Absolutely but I just point it out to your Honour as one of the perils of crossing state lines and in fact the crossing the state lines on parole but that's the fact. He'll serve sentence likely comparable to the co-accused in New South Wales. Can I ask your Honour to make a finding of special circumstances-

HIS HONOUR: What's the basis for special circumstances?

OLIVER: He has a patent need for rehabilitation.-

HIS HONOUR: Is he going to abide by that.

OLIVER: This is the difficulty. He can't really do it in New South Wales on a parole period because he'll be extradited to Queensland the day his non parole period expires here so he really is caught between a rock and a hard place. Which is unfortunate because he's got a capacity for rehabilitation. I don't know whether I'd put it so hard as to say he's got good prospects but he's obviously got a capacity. In Tasmania where he committed a break in offence your Honour will see he selected a house that had $20,000 cash in it of all things. Went on a complete bender, got completely sick of alcohol and handed himself into police. Volunteered the break in and went and served 11 months to detox in Tasmania. So the pilot light's on there with respect to rehabilitation. It's now just a matter of finding the time between his various state sentences as they will be to do it. And he's got talent. He's done a glazing apprenticeship…”


	
	After recounting the Applicant’s extensive criminal history, the sentencing Judge found that the criminal history did not allow the court to extend leniency on sentence. His Honour observed:
	


“The offender has committed many crimes in three States and served periods of incarceration for much of his life.”


	
	A discount of 25% was allowed for the utilitarian value of the Applicant’s guilty plea.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied that the same sentence as that imposed on the Applicant’s co-offender was warranted.
	
	
	His Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant communicated two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.
	
	
	Ground 2 - the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he is serving and the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, Rousell.
	



	
	The foundation for the Applicant’s submissions in support of Ground 2 was an assertion that as the Applicant’s co-offender, Rousell, was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending, a more severe sentence than that imposed on the Applicant was warranted. Counsel for the Applicant conceded that otherwise, the circumstances of the Applicant and his co-offender were “virtually identical” and that there “was no material difference in the roles played by each in the offences”.
	
	
	There was some controversy between the parties as to whether the Applicant was in fact also on conditional liberty at the time of the offending. That conditional liberty was said to arise out of a parole order in relation to a sentence that had been imposed and partially served in Queensland.
	
	
	Mr Nash, counsel for the Applicant, filed in Court an affidavit of his instructing solicitor, Janet Kae Witmer, outlining the enquiries she had made to Corrective Services Queensland on 2 December 2014 as to whether the Applicant was on parole in Queensland on the date of the offending. Ms Witmer was informed that the Applicant was not on parole at that time.
	
	
	The Crown foreshadowed at the hearing in this Court the existence of a document in the form of a report from the relevant parole authority in Queensland evidencing that the Applicant was on parole at the time of the offence. The Court granted the Crown an opportunity to provide that material after the hearing. Counsel for the Applicant conceded that Ground 2 would be withdrawn if the document revealed that the Applicant was on parole at the relevant time.
	
	
	Thereafter, the Court was provided with an affidavit of Carolyn Griffiths, solicitor for the Crown, annexing a report dated 1 June 2015 from Queensland Corrective Services. That report revealed that the Applicant had been subject to a Parole Order, which on 21 April 2010, was cancelled taking effect from 30 March 2010.
	
	
	As a result, at the time of the offending on 6 June 2010, the Applicant, having had his Parole Order cancelled, was not lawfully at liberty. This aspect provided no assistance to the Applicant on sentence: R v King [2003] NSWCCA 352 at [38].
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Applicant did not press the second ground of appeal.
	


The Remaining Ground of Appeal - Suggested error in failing to find special circumstances

Submissions for the Applicant


	
	The Applicant advanced two arguments in support of the ground that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to find special circumstances.
	
	
	Firstly, counsel for the Applicant submitted that by virtue of the sentence imposed on the Applicant commencing immediately after the sentences he was serving between 29 December 2012 and 28 August 2013 had expired, special circumstances ought to have been found so as to maintain the statutory ratio of 75% with respect to the Applicant’s total continuous time in custody.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the practical effect of his Honour’s approach is that the overall non-parole period represents 77.4% of the overall period in custody, if the eight months served between 29 December 2012 and 28 August 2013 for unrelated offending is taken into account. The Applicant submitted that a reduction of the non-parole period by one month and 15 days ought be made to re-establish the statutory ratio.
	
	
	Secondly, counsel for the Applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to consider the Applicant’s custodial history, and the resultant risk of institutionalisation, which supported a finding of special circumstances. The Applicant submitted that by the time he is eligible for parole, he would have spent all but four months of the previous six-and-a-half years in custody.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the matters relied upon by the Applicant in this Court were not addressed in submissions before the sentencing Judge. It was submitted that the only topic advanced as the basis for a finding of special circumstances was the asserted need for time to promote rehabilitation, a finding his Honour did not make.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in light of the Applicant’s significant criminal history and past failures at rehabilitation, it was open to his Honour to decline to find special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in all likelihood at the end of the non-parole period for the sentence he is presently serving, the Applicant will be extradited to Queensland. As a result, there is no prospect that the Applicant would be released to supervision to aid in rehabilitation whether the non-parole period was set at 77.4%, 75% or any other period.
	
	
	In any event, the Crown submitted that the difference between the parole period of 14 months as it is presently set, and the parole period of 15½ months that is apparently sought, is de minimis and does not warrant the intervention of this Court.
	


Decision


	
	Whether a finding of special circumstances is warranted in a given case falls within the discretion of the sentencing Judge. It is a question of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27]; Allen v R [2015] NSWCCA 113 at [33].
	
	
	If circumstances do exist that are capable of constituting special circumstances, the Court is not compelled to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]; Allen v R at [34].
	
	
	In the present case, the highest the Applicant’s submission in the District Court went on the issue of special circumstances was a submission that a finding ought to be made because of a “patent need for rehabilitation”.  This Court has, on a number of occasions, rejected the notion that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely or primarily by reason of considerations of rehabilitation: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; Allen v R at [37].
	
	
	A major impediment exists for an applicant to demonstrate on appeal that a primary Judge erred in failing to find special circumstances, if the circumstances said to give rise to that finding were not the subject of submissions at first instance. An appeal to this Court is not an opportunity for an applicant to revise and reformulate the case presented below, and this Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea: Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [81].
	
	
	While there is no doubt that an offender’s custodial history, and the risk of institutionalisation that may follow, is relevant to the discretion (Beale v R [2015] NSWCCA 120 at [68]; Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [50]; Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217 at [98]), the inherent difficulty facing the Applicant here is that this factor, now relied upon in this Court as a factor in support of a finding of special circumstances, was not articulated before the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	In Dyer v R, the Court said at [48]- [50]:
	


“48   …An applicant faces real difficulty in this Court in contending that a sentencing Judge has fallen into error by failing to take into account a material consideration, when that consideration was not advanced to the primary Judge as being a matter which should be taken into account.

49   A wide range of considerations are capable of constituting special circumstances for the purposes of s. 44(2): R v Simpson at 722 [88]. There is a practical expectation that an offender’s legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11].

50   There is no question that the risk of institutionalisation may, in a particular case, warrant a finding of “special circumstances”: Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]-[25]. Where such a submission is made, a sentencing Judge is not bound to make such a finding. It will be a factor to be taken into account with other factors, in the exercise of discretion, to determine whether a finding of “special circumstances” should be made.”


	
	Even if the submission advanced in this Court was made before the sentencing Judge, it does not follow that a finding of special circumstances would have been, or ought to have been made. The risk of institutionalisation of itself does not require a sentencing Judge to find special circumstances: Jinnette v R; Dyer v R. In Beale v R, Beech-Jones J (Hoeben CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) said at [68]-[69]:
	


“68   …the mere identification of an offender as being institutionalised or at risk of institutionalisation does not compel a sentencing Court to find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole period. The overall purpose of the exercise is to facilitate the offender’s rehabilitation. To that end ‘there must exist significant positive signs that which show that if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful’ (R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57]; see also R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]).

69   It follows that, even if an offender is either institutionalised or at risk of institutionalisation, it is open to a sentencing judge to nevertheless decline to make a finding of special circumstances and vary the minimum ratio if they are not sufficiently satisfied that a longer period of parole is likely to result in their rehabilitation being successful, especially if the other factors relevant to sentencing do not warrant that course (see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59] and [65])…”


	
	Given the circumstances of this case, including the Applicant’s extensive criminal history and his likely extradition to Queensland on expiry of the non-parole period, it would have been more than open to the sentencing Judge to refuse to find special circumstances, even if the Applicant’s risk of institutionalisation was placed before his Honour as a factor to be taken into account.
	
	
	The Applicant further relies, under this ground of appeal, upon the practical effect resulting from the present sentence operating cumulatively upon a pre-existing sentence for an unrelated offence.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge was not asked to find special circumstances on this basis.
	
	
	Even if the previous sentence is taken into account, the effective mandatory period of custody represents only 77.4% of the full period. This argument was not advanced at first instance. The Applicant is likely to be extradited to Queensland on the expiration of his non-parole period. No error has been demonstrated in the sentencing Judge’s approach to special circumstances.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	leave to appeal be granted; and
	
	
	the appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Johnson J.
